"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the BLOCK-ALLOCATE command in direct access commands, and how is it used to mark a sector as 'already used' on a diskette?","1581 disk:  ALLOCATING BLOCKS

  Once  you  have  written  something in a particular sector on a
diskette  with  the  help of direct access commands, you may wish
to mark that sector as  'already used',  to keep other files from
being written there. Blocks thus allocated will be safe until the
diskette is validated.

FORMAT FOR BLOCK-ALLOCATE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'BLOCK-ALLOCATE';drive#;track#;sector#

usually abbreviated as: PRINT#15,'B-A';drive#;track#;sector#

where  'drive#' is the drive number,  and  'track#' and 'sector#'
are  the track and sector containing the block of data to be read
into the file buffer.

ALTERNATE FORMAT:

  PRINT#15,'B-A:';drive#;track#;sector#

EXAMPLE:

  If  you  try  to allocate a block that isn't available, the DOS
will set the error message to number  65,  NO BLOCK,  and set the
track  and  sector  numbers  in  the  error  message  to the next
available track and sector number.  Therefore, before selecting a
block to write,  try  to allocate that block.  If the block isn't
available,  read  the next available block from the error channel
and allocate it instead.  However, do not allocate data blocks in
the  directory  track.  If  the  track  number returned is 0, the
diskette is full.
  Here is a program  that allocates a place to store a message on
a diskette.

  100 OPEN 15,8,15             Open command channel.
  110 OPEN 5,8,5,'#'           Open direct access channel.

  130 T=1: S=1                 Start at first track & sector.
  140 PRINT#15,'B-A';0;T;S     Try allocating it.
  150 INPUT#15,EN,EM$,ET,ES    See if it worked.
  160 IF EN=0 THEN 210         If so, we're almost done.
  170 IF EN<>65 THEN PRINT     'NO BLOCK'
      EN,EM$,ET,ES: STOP       means already allocated.
  180 IF ET=0 THEN PRINT       If next track is 0,
      'DISK FULL': STOP        we're out of room.
  190 IF ET=40 THEN ET=41:ES=0 Don't allocate the directory.
  200 T=ET: S=ES: GOTO 140     Try suggested track & sector next.
  210 PRINT#15,'U2';5;0;T;S    Write buffer to allocated
                               sector.

"In the context of the C64, What is the special character used by DOS to fill relative records as they are created, and how is it used when writing the last record in a relative file?","1581 disk:COMPLETING RELATIVE FILE CREATION

  Now that you have learned how to use both the  OPEN and RECORD#
commands,  you  are  almost  ready  to properly create a relative
file. The only additional fact you need to know is that CHR$(255)
is  a  special character in a relative file.  It is the character
used  by  the  DOS  to fill relative records as they are created,
before a program fills them with other information.  Thus, if you
want  to  write the last record,  you expect to need in your file

"In the context of the C64, What are splat files"" and how should they be handled on a diskette?""","SPLAT FILES

  One  indicator you may occasionally notice on a directory line,
after  you  begin  saving  programs  and  files,  is  an asterisk
appearing  just  before  the file type of a file that is 0 blocks
long.  This  indicates  the file was not properly closed after it
was created, and that it should not be relied upon. These 'splat'
files normally need to be erased from the diskette and rewritten.
However,  do not use the SCRATCH command to get rid of them. They
can  only  be  safely erased by the VALIDATE or COLLECT commands.
One  of  these  should  normally be used whenever a splat file is
noticed on a diskette. All of these commands are described in the
following chapters.
  There  are  two  exceptions  to the above warning:  one is that
VALIDATE  and  COLLECT  cannot  be  used  on  some diskettes that
include direct access  (random) files  (Chapter 6).  The other is
that  if  the information in the splat file was crucial and can't
be  replaced,  there is a way to rescue whatever part of the file
was  properly  written.  This  option  is  described  in the next
chapter."

where 'file#' is the same file number given in the desired file's
current OPEN statement,  and 'variable list' is one or more valid
BASIC  variable  names.  If  more  than one data element is to be
input  by a particular INPUT# statement,  each variable name must
be separated from others by a comma.

EXAMPLES:

To read back in the grades written with the PRINT# example, use:

  300 FOR CLASS = 1 TO COURSES

  320 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS
  330 NEXT CLASS

assuming your program includes an error check subroutine like the

  To  read  back  in  the  address data written by another PRINT#

"In the context of the C64, How do you erase a locked file on a diskette that cannot be deleted with the SCRATCH command?","1581 disk with basic 7,0:  Locked Files

  Occasionally,  a diskette will contain a locked file; one which
cannot  be  erased  with  the  SCRATCH command. Such files may be
recognized  by  the  '<'  character which immediately follows the
file type in their directory entry. If you wish to erase a locked
file,  you  will have to use a disk monitor to clear bit 6 of the
file-type   byte   in   the  directory  entry  on  the  diskette.
Conversely, to lock a file, you would set bit 6 of the same byte."
"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax and functionality of the RENAME command in a disk with BASIC 7.0?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: RENAME

  The RENAME command allows you to alter the name of a program or

affected, RENAME works very quickly.  If you try to RENAME a file
by using a file name already in the directory,  the computer will
respond  with  a  'FILE EXISTS'  error.  A file  must be properly

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the error checking program in Basic 2.0 and how can it be used to diagnose and clear disk errors?","1581 disk: ERROR CHECKING

  In Basic 2.0,  when the red drive light flashes, you must write
a small program to find out what the error is. This causes you to
lose  any  program variables already in memory.  The following is
the error check program:

  10 OPEN 15,8,15
  20 INPUT#15,EN,EM$,ET,ES
  30 PRINT EN,EM$,ET,ES
  40 CLOSE 15

  This  little  program  reads  the error channel into four BASIC
variables  (described  below),  and  prints  the  results  on the
screen.  A message is displayed whether there is an error or not,
but if there was an error, the program clears it from disk memory
and stops the error light from blinking.
  Once  the  message  is  on  the  screen,  you can look it up in
Appendix B to see what it means, and what to do about it.
  For those of you who are writing programs,  the  following is a
small error-checking subroutine you can include in your programs:

  59980 REM READ ERROR CHANNEL
  59990 INPUT#15,EN,EM$,ET,ES
  60000 IF EN>1 THEN PRINT EN,EM$,ET,ES: STOP
  60010 RETURN

  This  assumes  file  15  was opened earlier in the program, and
that it will be closed at the end of the program.
  The  subroutine  reads  the  error channel and puts the results
into  the  named  variables  --  EN  (Error  Number),  EM$ (Error
Message),  ET (Error Track),  and ES (Error Sector). Of the four,
only  EM$  has  to  be a string.  You could choose other variable
names, although these have become traditional for this use.
  Two error numbers are harmless -- 0 means everything is OK, and
1  tells  how  many  files  were  erased  by  a  SCRATCH  command
(described  later  in  this  chapter).  If  the  error  status is
anything else,  line 60000 prints the error message and halts the
program.
  Because  this  is  a  subroutine,  you access it with the BASIC
GOSUB  command,  either  in immediate mode or from a program. The
RETURN  statement  in line 60010 will jump back to immediate mode
or the next statement in your program, whichever is appropriate."

doesn't  currently exist in the file.  If there is no such record
yet,  DOS  will create it as soon as you try to write information
in  it,  and  also automatically create any other missing records
below it in number.  When the first record beyond the current end

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the buffer pointer in disk memory and how is it used to access and edit individual bytes within a block?","1581 disk:  THE BUFFER POINTER

  The buffer pointer points to where the next  READ or WRITE will
begin within a disk memory buffer.  By moving the buffer pointer,
you can access individual bytes within a block in any order. This
allows  you to edit any portion of a sector,  or organize it into
fields, like a relative record.

The  purpose  of  a BLOCK-WRITE is to save the contents of a file
buffer  into  a  specified sector.  It is thus the reverse of the
BLOCK-READ  command.  Although  the  BLOCK-WRITE command (B-W) is
still  part of the DOS command set,  it is nearly always replaced
by the U2 command.

FORMAT FOR THE BLOCK-WRITE COMMAND:

track  and  sector  numbers that should receive the block of data
being saved from the file buffer.

  PRINT#15,'U2:'channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  PRINT#15,'UB:'channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  PRINT#15,'U2:channel#,drive#,track#,sector#'

EXAMPLES:

  To restore  Track 40,  Sector 3  of the directory from the disk
buffer filled by a BLOCK-READ, use:

  PRINT#15,'U2';5;0;40;3

You'll return to this example on the next page,  after  you learn
to alter the directory in a useful way.
  You  can  also  use  a  BLOCK-WRITE to write a name in Track 1,
Sector 1,  a  rarely-used  sector.  This  can be used as a way of
marking a diskette  as belonging to you.  Here is a program to do
it, using the alternate form of the BLOCK-WRITE command:

  110 INPUT'YOUR NAME';NA$            Enter a name.
  120 OPEN 15,8,15                    Open command channel.

  180 END

As with the  BLOCK-READ command,  there is a  BLOCK-WRITE command
identical in function to  'U2'  that does not check the track and
sector parameters for valid bounds before attempting to write the
sector. Its format is:

  PRINT#15,'B-o';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the COLLECT command in BASIC 7.0?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: COLLECT

  The  COLLECT  command  recalculates  the Block Availability Map
(BAM)  of  the  current  diskette,  allocating only those sectors
still  being  used by valid,  properly closed files and programs.
All other sectors  (blocks) are left unallocated and free for re-
use, and all improperly closed files are automatically scratched.
However,  this  brief  description  of  COLLECT  doesn't indicate
either  the  power or the danger of the command.  Its power is in
restoring  to  good  health  many  diskettes whose directories or
Block Availability Maps have become muddled.  Any time the blocks
used  by  the  files  on a diskette plus the blocks shown as free
don't  add  up to the 3160 available on a fresh diskette, COLLECT
is  needed  (with  one  exception below).  Similarly,  any time a
diskette   contains  an  improperly  closed  file  (splat  file),
indicated  by  an  asterisk  (*)  next  to  its  file type in the
directory, that diskette needs to be collected.  In fact, but for
the one exception below,  it  is a good idea to COLLECT diskettes
whenever  you are concerned about their integrity.  Just note the
number  of  blocks  free  in  the diskette's directory before and
after  using  COLLECT.  If the totals differ,  there was indeed a
problem,  and the diskette should probably be copied onto a fresh
diskette  file-by-file,  using  a  copy  program described in the
previous section, rather than using backup program.
  The  exception  is diskettes containing direct access files, as
described in Chapter 6.  Most direct access (random) files do not
allocate  their  sectors  in a way COLLECT command can recognize.
Thus,  collecting  such a diskette may result in unallocating all
direct access files,  with  loss of all their contents when other
files are added.  Unless specifically instructed otherwise, never
COLLECT  a  diskette containing direct access files. (Note: these
are  not  the  same as the relative files described in Chapter 5.
COLLECT may be used on relative files without difficulty.)

the  '+'  and  '-'  signs,  the  decimal  point  (.),  the  SPACE
character, and the letter 'E' used in scientific notation. If any

usual  causes  of  this error are a mismatch between the order in
which variables are written to  and  read from a file,  a missing
carriage return within a  PRINT#  statement that writes more than
one data item,  or a data item  that includes either a comma or a
colon without a preceding quotation mark.  Once a file data error

"In the context of the C64, What are the special pattern-matching characters used to load a program from a partial name or to provide selective directories, and how do they work?","1581 disk: PATTERN MATCHING

  You  can  use  special  pattern-matching  characters  to load a
program   from  a  partial  name  or  to  provide  the  selective
directories described earlier.
  The  two  characters  used in pattern matching are the asterisk
(*)  and  the question mark  (?).  They act something like a wild
card in a game of cards.  The difference between the two  is that
the  asterisk  makes  all  characters in  and beyond its position
wild,  while  the question mark makes only its own position wild.
Here are some examples and their results:

  LOAD'A*',8  loads the first file on disk that begins with an A,
  regardless of what follows

  DLOAD'SM?TH'  loads  the  first  file that starts with SM, ends
  with TH, and one other character between

  DIRECTORY'Q*'  loads  a  directory  of  files whose names begin
  with Q

  LOAD'*',8  is a special case. When an asterisk is used alone as
  a name,  it matches the last file used  (on the C64 and C128 in
  C64 mode).

  LOAD '0:*',8 loads the first file on the diskette (C64 and C128

  A BASIC string may be up to 255 characters long,  although  the
longest string you can enter via a single INPUT statement is just
under two lines of text. This lower limitation is due to the size
of the input buffer in Commodore's serial bus computers. The same

  Eventually,  you  may  run  across  a  file  which  has a crazy
filename,  such as a comma by itself (',') or one that includes a
Shifted  Space.  Or  perhaps you will find one that includes non-
printing  characters.  Any  of  these  can be troublesome.  Comma
files,  for  instance,  are  an exception to the rule that no two
files can have the same name.  Since  it shouldn't be possible to
make  a  file whose name is only a comma,  the disk never expects
you to do it again.
  Files  with  a   Shifted  Space  in  their  name  can  also  be
troublesome,  because  the  disk  interprets the Shifted Space as
signaling  the end of the file name,  and prints whatever follows
after  the  quotation  mark  that  marks the end of a name in the
directory.  This  technique can be useful by allowing you to have
a long file name,  and  making the disk recognize a small part of
it  as  being  the same as the whole thing without using pattern-
matching characters.
  In any case,  if  you have a troublesome filename,  you can use
the  CHR$()  function  to  specify troublesome characters without
typing  them  directly.  This  may allow you to build them into a
RENAME  command.  If  this  fails,  you may also use the pattern-
matching characters  discussed for a SCRATCH command.  This gives
you  a  way  to  specify  the  name without using the troublesome
characters at all, but also means loss of your file.
  For  example,  if  you  have  managed  to  create  a file named
''MOVIES',  with an extra quotation mark at the front of the file
name,  you can rename it to  'MOVIES' using the CHR$() equivalent
of a quotation mark in the RENAME command:

  RENAME (CHR$(34)+'MOVIES') TO 'MOVIES'

The  CHR$(34)  forces  a  quotation  mark into the command string
without  upsetting  BASIC.  The  procedure  for  a file name that
includes a Shifted Space is similar, but uses CHR$(160).
  In cases  where even this doesn't work,  for  example,  if your
diskette contains a comma file,  (one named ',')  you can get rid
of it this way:

  SCRATCH '?'

  This example deletes all files with one-character names.

  Depending  on  the  exact  problem,  you  may  have  to be very
creative in choosing pattern-matching characters that will affect
only  the desired file,  and may have to rename other files first
to keep them from being scratched.
  In  some  cases,  it  may  be easier to copy desired files to a
different diskette and leave the troublesome files behind."

"In the context of the C64, What are the original block-read and block-write commands, their formats, and how do they differ from the U1 and U2 commands?","1581 disk:  THE ORIGINAL BLOCK-READ AND BLOCK-WRITE COMMANDS

  Although  the  BLOCK-READ  and  BLOCK-WRITE commands are nearly
always  replaced  by  the  U1  and  U2 commands respectively, the
original  commands  can  still  be  used,  as  long  as you fully
understand their effects. Unlike U1 and U2, B-R and B-W allow you
to read or write less than a full sector. In the case of B-R, the
first  byte  of  the  selected  sector  is used to set the buffer
pointer (see next section), and determines how many bytes of that
sector are read into a disk memory buffer. A program may check to
be sure it  doesn't attempt to read past the end of data actually
loaded  into  the  buffer,  by watching for the value of the file
status  variable  ST  to change from 0 to 64.  When the buffer is
written  back  to diskette by B-W,  the first byte written is the
current  value  of  the buffer pointer.  Only that many bytes are
written into the specified sector. B-R and B-W may thus be useful
in working with custom-designed file structures.

and

abbreviated as: PRINT#15,'B-W';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

where  'channel#'  is  the channel number specified when the file
into  which  the  block will be read was opened,  'drive#' is the
drive number, and 'track#' and 'sector#' are the track and sector
numbers containing the desired block of data to be partially read
into or written from the file buffer.


|   In a true BLOCK-READ, the first byte of the selected sector |
| is  used  to  determine how many bytes of that sector to read |
| into the disk  memory buffer.  It thus cannot be used to read |
| an entire sector  into the buffer,  as the first data byte is |
| always  interpreted  as  being  number of characters to read, |
| rather than part of the data.                                 |
|   Similarly,  in  a  true  BLOCK-WRITE,  when  the  buffer is |

| current value of the  buffer  pointer.  Only  that many bytes |
| are written into the specified  sector.  It cannot be used to |

"In the context of the C64, What are the rules and procedures for creating and managing partitions and sub-directories on a 1581 disk?","1581 disk:  PARTITIONS AND SUB-DIRECTORIES

  The 1581 allows the user to create partition areas on the disk.
Partitions were originally implemented to provide a mechanism for
easily  protecting  a  particular  section  of  the disk. That is
useful  for  permanently  allocating  part of the disk for things
such as BOOT sectors, CP/M work area, or reserving space for user
defined random files.
  Normally,  sectors on the disk can be marked as used by setting
the appropriate bit in the RAM  (most easily done with the BLOCK-
ALLOCATE  command).  That prevents them from being overwritten. A
VALIDATE command, however, will de-allocate this area. To protect
these  special  blocks from being de-allocated during a VALIDATE,
place them in a user defined partition area. The VALIDATE command
in  the  1581  automatically  skips  over  file  entries that are
partition files (file type = CBM),  which guarantees the intended
area is, and remains, allocated.
  Partition areas are given names by the user when first created.
They appear in the main directory as file type CBM.
  A partition area is created by the following command:

  PRINT#15,'/0:partition name,'+CHR$(starting track)+CHR$
  (starting sector)+CHR$(<# of sectors)+CHR$(># of sectors)+',C'

  Large  enough  partitions  can also be used as sub-directories.
There are, however, certain limitations if a partition area is to
be used as a sub-directory area.

  1) The partition are must be at least 120 sectors in size.
  2) The starting sector must be 0.
  3) The ending sector must be a multiple of 40.
  4) The area to be allocated cannot contain track 40 (the
     original system track).

  Partitions  can  also  be  created with a partition. This means
that  sub-sub-directories can be created if their partitions meet
the above rules. 

  Partition  areas  which meet the qualifications of being a sub-
directory can then be selected by the following command:

  PRINT#15,'/0:partition name'

  Once  selected,  the  partition  are  cannot  be used as a sub-
directory until it is formatted.  The  HEADER or NEW commands are
used  to  format  this  sub-disk  area.  Make  sure that you have
successfully  selected  this partition area before formatting. If
not, the wrong directory area will be reformatted.  You can check
if  the  area  was  successfully  selected  by checking the error
channel. If everything went OK, the error channel would read:

  02, SELECTED PARTITION,first track#,last track#

  If   the   area  you  attempt  to  select  does  not  meet  the
qualifications of a sub-directory,  then  the error channel would
return:

  77, SELECTED PARTITION ILLEGAL,00,00

  Only  one  level of sub-directory can be selected at a time. To
get from the ROOT to PART21 you would have to execute the command
twice.

  PRINT#15,'/0:PART2'
  PRINT#15,'/0:PART21'

  Directories  can only be traversed in the forward direction. To
get  to  sub-directory  which  is  on  a node above the presently
selected node of the tree, you must select the ROOT directory and
work your way down the tree, selecting a branch at a time. To get
to the ROOT directory directly from any node type:

  PRINT#15,'/'

  When the user selects a particular sub-directory area,  it then
becomes  the  default  working  area.  Accesses  to  the disk for
directories, loading files, saving files, etc.,  will all be done
within  this  area.  Files  outside  of  the  selected  area  are
effectively invisible.
  File  and  local BAM information for sub-directories are stored
within  the  sub-directory  areas themselves.  The information is
stored  on  the  first allocated track of the partition area, and
has the same format as track 40.  When  creating  partitions  and
sub-directories  within  sub-directories it is the responsibility
of  the  user  to  make  sure  that  he  doesn't  overwrite  this
information!  The  DOS  only  checks  to make sure that you don't
attempt  to  overwrite  this  information  for the ROOT directory
(track 40).  It  is  up  to  the  user  to  make  sure  that this
information isn't corrupted in the sub-directories.
  Partitioned  areas  can  be freed up  simply by  SCRATCHING the
partition  file  entry  in  the  appropriate  directory.  If  the
partition was being used as a sub-directory,  all of the files in
that sub-directory will be lost."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the MEMORY-WRITE command in the context of the 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk:  MEMORY-WRITE

  The  MEMORY-WRITE  command is the equivalent of the  BASIC POKE
command,  but has its effect in disk memory instead of within the
computer.  M-W  allows you to write up to 35 bytes at a time into
disk  memory.  The  MEMORY-EXECUTE  and some USER commands can be
used to run any programs written this way:

FORMAT FOR THE MEMORY-WRITE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'M-W'CHR$(<address)CHR$(>address)CHR$(# of bytes)
           CHR$(data byte(s))

where  '<address'  is the low order part,  and  '>address' is the
high order part of the address  in disk memory  to begin writing,
'# of bytes'  is  the  number  of  memory  locations that will be
written (from 1-35),  and 'data byte' is 1 or more byte values to
be written into disk memory, each as a CHR$() value.

EXAMPLES:

We  can  use  this line to turn off the 'bumps' when loading DOS-
protected  programs  (i.e.,  programs  that  have  been protected
against  being  copied by creating and checking for specific disk
errors).

  PRINT#15,'M-W'CHR$(48)CHR$(0)CHR$(1)CHR$(133)

  The following line can be used to recover bad sectors,  such as
when  an  important  file  has  been  damaged  and cannot be read
normally:

  PRINT#15,'M-W'CHR$(48)CHR$(0)CHR$(1)CHR$(31)

  These two examples may be very useful under some circumstances.
They   are   the   equivalent   of   POKE 48,133  and  POKE 48,31
respectively,  but  in  disk memory,  not inside the computer. As
mentioned in the previous section's first example, location 48 in
the  1581  disk  drive  signifies  two separate activities to the
drive,  all related to error recovery.  Bit 7  (the high bit), if
set means no  'bumps'  (don't move the read head to track 1). The
bottom six bits are the count of how many times the disk will try
to  read  each  sector  before  and  after trying seeks and bumps
before  giving  up.  Since  31  is the largest number that can be
expressed  in  six  bits,  that  is  the  maximum number of tries
allowed.
  From this example,  you  can see the value of knowing something
about  PEEKS,  POKES,  and  machine-language before using direct-
access disk commands, as well as their potential power."

"In the context of the C64, What is a sequential data file and how does it work on a diskette?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: SEQUENTIAL DATA FILES


  A file on a diskette is just like a file cabinet in your office
-- an organized place to put things. Nearly everything you put on
a diskette goes in one kind of file or another. So far all you've
used are program files,  but there are others.  In  this  chapter
you'll learn about sequential data files.
  The primary purpose of a data file  is to store the contents of
program variables, so they won't be lost when the program ends. A
sequential  data  file  is  one  in  which  the  contents  of the
variables are stored 'in sequence',  one right after another. You
may  already  be  familiar  with  sequential  files  from using a
DATASSETTE,  because  sequential  files on diskette are just like
the  data  files  used  on  cassettes.  Whether  on  cassette  or
diskette, sequential files must be read from beginning to end.
  When  sequential  files  are  created,  information  (data)  is
transferred  byte-by-byte,  through  a buffer,  onto the magnetic
media.  Once  in  the disk drive, program files,  sequential data
files,  and user files all work sequentially.  Even the directory
acts like a sequential file.
  To use sequential files properly, we will learn some more BASIC
words  in  the next few pages.  Then we'll put them together in a
simple but useful program.


|   Besides  sequential  data  files,  two other file types are |
| recorded sequentially on a diskette.  They are program files, |
| and user files.  When you save a program on a diskette, it is |
| saved  in  order  from  beginning  to  end,   just  like  the |
| information in a sequential data file. The main difference is |
| in the commands you use to access it.  User files can be even |
| more similar to sequential data files.  User files are almost |
| never used,  but like program files, they could be treated as |
| though  they  were  sequential  data  files  and  some can be |
| accessed with the same commands.                              |
|   For the advanced user,  the similarity  of the various file |
| types  offers  the possibility of reading a program file into |
| the computer a byte (character) at a time and rewriting it to |
| the diskette in a modified form.                              |"

of planning, the same can be done via a program loop. Since there
is no harm in closing a file  that wasn't open,  close every file
you  even  think  might  be  open before ending a program. If you
always gave your files numbers  between 1 and 5,  you could close
them all with

"In the context of the C64, What is the command to format a new diskette on a Commodore computer?","HOW TO PREPARE A NEW DISKETTE

  A diskette needs a pattern of circular magnetic tracks in order
for  the  drive's  read/write  head  to  find  things on it. This
pattern is not on your diskettes  when you buy them,  but you can
use  the  HEADER  command  or  the  NEW  command  to  add it to a
diskette.  That  is  known  as  formatting the disk.  This is the
command to use with the C128 in C128 mode or Plus/4:

  HEADER 'diskette name',Iid,Ddrive#[,Udevice#]

where 'diskette name' is any desired name for the diskette, up to
16  characters  long  (including spaces).  'id'  can  be  any two
characters as long as they don't form a BASIC keyword (such as IF
or  ON)  either  on  their own or with the capital I before them.
'drive#' is 0.  'device#' is 8, unless you have changed it as per
instructions in Appendix A  (the 1581 assumes 8 even if you don't
type it in).

  The command for the C64, VIC 20, or C128 in C64 mode is this:

  OPEN 15,device#,15,'NEWdrive#:diskette name,id'
  CLOSE 15

INPUT#  is  nearly  identical to  INPUT,  except that the list of
items  following  the  command  word comes from a particular file
instead of the keyboard.  Both statements are subject to the same
limitations-halting  input after a comma or colon,  not accepting
data  items  too  large  to  fit in BASIC's input buffer, and not
accepting non-numeric data into a numeric variable."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the OPEN statement in Commodore BASIC and how does it interact with various devices in a Commodore computer system?","1581 disk with basic 7,0:  OPENING A FILE

  One  of  the most powerful tools in Commodore BASIC is the OPEN
statement.  With it, you may send data almost anywhere, much like
a telephone switchboard.  As you might expect, a command that can
do  this  much  is  fairly  complex.  You  have already used OPEN
statements regularly in some of your diskette commands.
  Before you study the format of the OPEN statement, let's review
some of the possible devices in a Commodore computer system.

Device#:  Name:   Used for:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
0     Keyboard    Receiving input from the computer operator
1     DATASSETTE  Sending and receiving information from cassette
2     RS232       Sending and receiving information from a modem
3     Screen      Sending output to a video display
4,5   Printer     Sending output to a hard copy printer
8-11  Disk Drive  Sending and receiving information from diskette
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  Because of the flexibility of the OPEN statement it is possible
for  a  single  program  statement  to  contact  any one of these
devices,  or  even  others,  depending  on  the value of a single
character in the command. If the character is kept in a variable,
the  device can even change each time that part of the program is
used,  sending  data alternately and with equal ease to diskette,
cassette, printer and screen.


|   In  the  last  chapter  you  learned  how to check for disk |
| errors  after  disk  commands  in  a  program.  It is equally |
| important  to check for disk errors after using file-handling |
| statements.  Failure  to  detect  a  disk  error before using |
| another file-handling statement could cause loss of data, and |
| failure of the BASIC program.                                 |
|   The  easiest  way  to check the disk is to follow all file- |

"In the context of the C64, How does a file-handling program using random files keep track of which blocks on the disk have been used?","1581 disk:  USING RANDOM FILES

  By combining the commands in this chapter,  it  is  possible to
develop a file-handling program that uses random files.  What you
need to know now is how to keep track of which blocks on the disk
such a file has used. (Even though you know a sector has not been
allocated by your random file,  you  must  also be sure it wasn't
allocated by another unrelated file on the diskette.)
  The  most  common way of recording which sectors have been used
by  a  random  file is in a sequential file.  The sequential file
stores a list of record numbers, with the track, sector, and byte
location of each record.  This means three channels are needed by
a random file:  one  for the command channel,  one for the random
data, and the last for the sequential data."

"In the context of the C64, What is the importance of closing a file after using it ?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: CLOSING A FILE

  After you finish using a data file,  it  is extremely important
that you CLOSE it.  During the process of writing a file, data is
accumulated  in  a  memory  buffer,  and  only written out to the
diskette when the buffer fills.
  Working this way, there is almost always a small amount of data
in  the  buffer  that  has  not been written to diskette yet, and
which would simply be lost if the computer system were tuned off.
Similarly,  there  are  diskette  housekeeping  matters,  such as
updating the BAM  (Block Availability Map) of sectors used by the
current file,  which are not performed during the ordinary course
of  writing  a  file.  This  is  the  reason  for  having a CLOSE
statement.  When  you  are done with a file,  the CLOSE statement
will  write  the  rest of the data buffer out to diskette, update
the  BAM,  and complete the file's entry in the directory. Always
close  a  data file when you are done using it.  Failure to do so
may cause loss of the entire file.
  However,  do not close the disk command channel until all other
files  have been closed.  The command channel should be the first
file opened, and the last file closed in any program."
"In the context of the C64, How can you create a sub-directory that lists a single selected type of file using the LOAD or DIRECTORY command?","1581 disk: SELECTIVE DIRECTORIES

  By altering the directory  LOAD command,  you can create a sub-
directory that lists a single selected type of file. For example,
you  could  request  a list of all sequential data files (Chapter
4), or one of all the relative data files (Chapter 5). The format
for this command is:

  LOAD'$0:pattern=filetype',8    (for the C64)

where pattern specifies a particular group of files, and filetype
is  the  one-letter  abbreviation  for  the types of files listed
below:

  P = Program
  S = Sequential
  R = Relative
  U = User

The command for the C128 and Plus/4 is this:

  DIRECTORY'pattern=filetype'

Some examples:

  LOAD'$0:*=R',8  and  DIRECTORY'*=R' display all relative files.

  LOAD'$0:Z*=R',8  and  DIRECTORY'Z*=R'  display  a sub-directory
  consisting of all relative files  that start with the letter Z.

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the BLOCK-READ command in DOS?","1581 disk:  BLOCK-READ

  The  purpose  of  a  BLOCK-READ  is  to  load the contents of a
specified  sector  into  a  file buffer.  Although the BLOCK-READ
command (B-R) is still part of the DOS command set,  it is nearly
always replaced the U1 command (See Chapter 6).

FORMAT FOR THE BLOCK-READ COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'U1';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

where  'channel#'  is  the channel number specified when the file
into  which  the  block will be read was opened,  'drive#' is the
drive number,  and  'track#'  and  'sector#' are respectively the
track  and sector numbers containing the desired block of data to
be read into the file buffer.

  Here  is  a  complete program to read a sector into disk memory
using  U1,  and  from  there into computer memory via GET#. (If a
carriage  return will appear at least once in every 88 characters
of data, INPUT# may be used in place of GET#).

  140 OPEN 15,8,15                  Open command channel.

  As the loop progresses, the contents of the specified track and
sector are copied into computer memory,  beginning at the address
set by variable MB in line 160,  and  may be examined and altered
there.

  The  DOS  always checks that the track and sector parameters of
the  BLOCK-READ  command are within the proper range.  If they're
not,  a '66, ILLEGAL TRACK AND SECTOR'  error occurs.  In certain
instances it might be necessary to access a track and sector that
are not within what the DOS considers the proper bounds.  This is
a  special  case  and,  unless  absolutely  necessary,  should be
avoided. Nonetheless, there is a command identical in function to
'U1' that doesn't check to see if the track and sector parameters
are within bounds before attempting to read it. Its format is:

  PRINT#15,'B-_';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

  When  working  with  direct access data,  you need two channels
open to the disk:  the  command channel we've used throughout the

the  usual  OPEN 15,8,15  or  equivalent.  A  direct  access data
channel  is  opened  much like other files,  except that the hash
sign (#),  optionally followed by a memory buffer number, is used
as a file name.

FORMAT FOR DIRECT ACCESS FILE OPEN STATEMENTS:

number,  normally  8;  'channel#' is the channel number, a number
between  2 and 14  not used by other files open at the same time;

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the DCLEAR command on a Commodore 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: DCLEAR

  One command that should not often be needed on the 1581, but is
still of occasional value is DCLEAR.  On the 1581, and nearly all
other Commodore drives, this function is performed automatically,
whenever a new diskette is inserted.
  The result of an DCLEAR,  whether forced by a command,  or done
automatically  by  the  disk,  is  a  re-reading  of  the current
diskette's BAM  into a disk buffer.  This information must always
be  correct  in  order  for the disk to store new files properly.
However,  since the chore is handled automatically, the only time
you'd  need  to  use the command is if something happened to make
the information in the drive buffers unreliable."
"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax and usage of the PRINT# command in BASIC, and how is it used to write data to a sequential disk file?","1581 disk with basic 7,0:FORMAT FOR THE PRINT# COMMAND:

  PRINT#file#,data list

where 'file#' is the same file number given in the desired file's
current  OPEN statement.  During any given access of a particular
file, the file number must remain constant because it serves as a
shorthand  way  of relating all other file-handling commands back
to the correct OPEN statement.  Given a file number, the computer
can look up everything else about a file that matters.
  The 'data list' is the same as for a PRINT statement  -- a list
of  constants,  variables and/or expressions,  including numbers,
strings or both. However, it's better if each PRINT# statement to
disk  include  only  one  data item.  If you wish to include more
items,  they  should be separated by a carriage return character,
not  a comma.  Semicolons are permitted,  but not recorded in the
file, and do not result in any added spaces in the file. Use them
to  separate  items in the list that might otherwise be confused,
such  as  a  string  variable  immediately  following  a  numeric
variable.

|   Do  not  leave  a  space between PRINT  and  #,  and do not |
| abbreviate  the  command as ?#.  The correct abbreviation for |
| PRINT# is pR.                                                 |

EXAMPLES:

  To record a few grades for John Paul Jones,  using a sequential
disk file #1 previously opened for writing, use:

  200 FOR CLASS=1 TO COURSES
  210 PRINT#1,GRADE$(CLASS)
  220 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS
  230 NEXT CLASS

assuming your program includes an error check subroutine like the
one in the last chapter.
  In  using  PRINT#,  there is an exception to the requirement to
check  for  disk errors after every file-handling statement. When
using PRINT#, a single check after an entire set of data has been
written  will  still  detect  the error,  so long as the check is
made before any other file-handling statement  or disk command is
used.  You may be familiar with PRINT statements in which several
items follow each other:

  400 PRINT NAME$,STREET$,CITY$

To  get  those  same variables onto sequential disk file number 5
instead  of  the screen,  the best approach would be to use three
separate PRINT# statements, as follows:

  400 PRINT#5,NAME$
  410 PRINT#5,STREET$
  420 PRINT#5,CITY$

If you need to combine them, here is a safe way to do it:

  400 PRINT#5,NAME$;CHR$(13);STREET$;CHR$(13);CITY$

CHR$(13)  is  the  carriage  return  character,  and has the same
effect  as  putting  the print items in separate lines. If you do
this  often,  some  space  and  time  may  be saved by previously
defining a variable as equal to CHR$(13):

   10 CR$=CHR$(13)
  400 PRINT#5,NAME$;CR$;STREET$;CR$;CITY$

  The  basic idea is that a proper sequential disk-file write, if
redirected  to  the  screen,  will display only one data item per
line, with each succeeding item on the next line."
"In the context of the C64, What is a diskette directory and how is it viewed on a Commodore computer?","DISKETTE DIRECTORY

  A directory is a list of the files on a diskette.  To  view the
directory on the  C128 or Plus/4,  type the word  DIRECTORY  on a
blank line and press the  [RETURN]  key or simply press the  [F3]
key  on  the C128.  That doesn't erase anything in memory, so you
can  call up a directory anytime  --  even from within a program.
The C64 directory command, LOAD'$',8 (press [RETURN]) LIST (press
[RETURN]), does erase what's in memory.
  If a directory doesn't all fit on the screen, it will scroll up
until  it  reaches the last line.  If you want to pause, stop, or
slow  down  the  scrolling,  refer  to your particular computer's
user's manual for instructions as to which keys to use.
  To  get  an  idea  of  what  a  directory  looks like, load the
directory from the Test/Demo diskette.
  The 0 on the left-hand side of the top line is the drive number
of the 1581.  The diskette name is next, followed by the diskette
id  --  both  of  which  are  determined  when  the  diskette  is
formatted.
  The  3D  at the end of the top line means the 1581 uses version
3D of Commodore's disk operating system (DOS).
  Each   of   the   remaining  lines  provides  three  pieces  of
information  about the files on the diskette.  At the left end of
each  line  is  the size of the file in blocks of 254 characters.
Four  blocks  are  equivalent  to  almost 1K of memory inside the
computer.  The  middle  of the line contains the name of the file
enclosed in quotation marks.  All characters within the quotation
marks  are  part  of  the  filename.  The right side of each line
contains a three-letter abbreviation of the file type.  The types
of files are described in later chapters.
  The  bottom  line  of  a  directory  shows  how many blocks are
available  for  use.  This  number  ranges  from  3160 on a newly
formatted diskette to 0 on one that is completely full."

  Expert  programmers  can  give commands that directly alter the
workings of the  1581,  much as skilled programmers can alter the
workings of BASIC inside the computer with PEEKs,  POKEs  and SYS
calls.  It  is  also  possible to write machine language programs
that  load  and  run entirely within the 1581,  either by writing
them into disk memory from  the  computer,  or  by  loading  them
directly  from diskette into the desired disk memory buffer. This
is  similar  to  loading and running machine language programs in
your computer.
  As when learning to use PEEK,  POKE  and  SYS in your computer,
extreme caution is advised in using the commands in this chapter.
They are essentially machine language commands,  and  lack all of
BASIC's safeguards.  If anything goes wrong, you may have to turn
the disk drive off and on again  (after removing the diskette) to
regain  control.  Do not practice these commands on any important
diskette.  Rather,  make a spare copy and work with that. Knowing

  The COPY command allows you to make a spare copy of any program
or file on a diskette.  On a single drive like the 1581, the copy
must  be  on  the  same diskette,  which means it must be given a
different name from the file copied. It's also used to combine up
to  four sequential data file  (linking the files one to another,
end  to end in a chain).  Files are linked in the order and other
files  on  the  diskette  are  not changed.  Files must be closed
before they are copied or linked.

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and precautions of using the VALIDATE command on a diskette?","1581 disk:  VALIDATE

  The VALIDATE command recalculates the  Block  Availability  Map
(BAM)  of  the  current  diskette,  allocating only those sectors
still  being  used by valid,  properly-closed files and programs.
All other sectors  (blocks) are left unallocated and free for re-
use, and all improperly closed files are automatically scratched.
This  brief  description  of its workings doesn't indicate either
the power or the danger of the VALIDATE command.  Its power is in
restoring  to  good  health  many  diskettes whose directories or
block availability maps have become muddled.  Any time the blocks
used  by  the  files  on a diskette plus the blocks shown as free
don't add up to the 3160 available on a fresh diskette,  VALIDATE
is  needed,  with  one  exception  below.  Similarly,  any time a
diskette   contains   an  improperly-closed  file  (splat  file),
indicated  by  an  asterisk  (*)  next  to  its  file type in the
directory,  that diskette needs to be validated. In fact, but for
the  one  exception,  it  is  a  good  idea to VALIDATE diskettes
whenever you are the least bit concerned about their integrity.
  The  exception  is diskettes containing direct access files, as
described in Chapter 6.  Most direct access (random) files do not
allocate  their  sectors  in  a  way  the  VALIDATE  command  can
recognize.  Thus, using VALIDATE on such a diskette may result in
unallocating  all  direct  access  files,  with loss of all their
contents   when  other  files  are  added.   Unless  specifically
instructed otherwise, never use VALIDATE on a diskette containing
direct access files."

different  memory  locations.  If  the  disk  copy of the program

"In the context of the C64, How do you handle renaming and deleting files with troublesome characters in their names, such as commas, Shifted Spaces, or non-printing characters, in a disk file system?","1581 disk: RENAMING AND SCRATCHING TROUBLESOME FILES

  Eventually,  you  may  run  across  a  file  which  has  an odd
filename,  such as a comma by itself (',') or one that includes a
Shifted Space (a Shifted Space looks same as a regular space, but
if  a  file  with a space in its name won't load properly and all
else is correct,  it's probably a Shifted Space).  Or perhaps you
will find one that includes non-printing characters. Any of these
can be troublesome.  Comma files,  for instance, are an exception
to  the  rule  that no two files can have the same name. Since it
shouldn't  be possible to make a file whose name is only a comma,
the disk never expects you to do it again.
  Files  with  a   Shifted  Space  in  their  name  can  also  be
troublesome,  because  the  disk  interprets the Shifted Space as
signaling  the end of the file name,  and prints whatever follows
after  the  quotation  mark  that  marks the end of a name in the
directory.  This  technique can be useful by allowing you to have
a  long file name,  and making the disk recognize a small part of
it  as  being  the same as the whole thing without using pattern-
matching characters.
  In any case,  if  you have a troublesome filename,  you can use
the  CHR$()  function  to  specify troublesome characters without
typing  them  directly.  This  may allow you to build them into a
RENAME  command.  If  this  fails,  you may also use the pattern-
matching characters in a SCRATCH command. This gives you a way to
specify the name without using the troublesome characters at all,
but also means loss of your file.
  For  example,  if  you  have  managed  to  create  a file named
''MOVIES',  with an extra quotation mark at the front of the file
name,  you can rename it to  'MOVIES' using the CHR$() equivalent
of a quotation mark in the RENAME command:

  PRINT#15,'R0:MOVIES='+CHR$(34)+'MOVIES'

The  CHR$(34)  forces  a  quotation  mark into the command string
without  upsetting  BASIC.  The  procedure  for  a file name that
includes a Shifted Space is similar, but uses CHR$(160).
  In cases  where even this doesn't work,  for  example,  if your
diskette contains a comma file,  (one named ',')  you can get rid
of it this way:

  PRINT#15,'S0:?'

  This example deletes all files with one-character names.

  Depending  on  the  exact  problem,  you  may  have  to be very
creative in choosing pattern-matching characters that will affect
only  the desired file,  and may have to rename other files first
to keep them from being scratched.
  In  some  cases,  it  may  be easier to copy desired files to a
different diskette and leave the troublesome files behind."
"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax and usage of the RENAME command in a diskette directory?","1581 disk:  RENAME

  The RENAME command allows you to alter the name of a program or
other file in the diskette directory. Since only the directory is
affected, RENAME works very quickly.

FORMAT FOR RENAME COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'RENAME0:new name=old name'

or it may be abbreviated as:

  PRINT#15,'R0:new name=old name'

where  'new name' is the name you want the file to have, and 'old
name'  is  the name it has now.  'new name' may be any valid file
name,  up  to  16  characters  in length.  It is assumed you have
already opened file 15 to the command channel.
  One  caution  --  be  sure  the  file you are renaming has been
properly closed before you rename it.

EXAMPLES:

Just before saving a new copy of a 'calendar' program,  you might
type:

  PRINT#15,'R0:CALENDAR/BACKUP=CALENDAR'

Or to move a program called  'BOOT',  currently the first program
on a diskette to someplace else in the directory, you might type:

  PRINT#15,'R0:TEMP=BOOT'

followed by a COPY command (described later),  which turns 'TEMP'
into a new copy of  'BOOT',  and finishing with a SCRATCH command
to get rid of the original copy of 'BOOT'."

  The  actual  procedure  is  this  --  the  new version is saved

entry altered to point to the new version.  Because it works this
way,  there  is little danger a disaster such as having the power
going  off  midway through the process would destroy both the old

after the new copy is saved properly."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the PRINT DS$ command and how can it be used in a program to handle disk errors?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: ERROR CHECKING

  When  the  drive  light  (red light) flashes,  you must use the
following command to find out what the error is:

  PRINT DS$

  A  message  is  displayed  whether there is an error or not. If
there  was an error,  this command clears it from disk memory and
turns off the error light on the disk drive.
  Once  the  message  is  on  the  screen,  you can look it up in
Appendix B to see what it means, and what to do about it.
  For those of you who are writing programs,  the  following is a
small error-checking subroutine you can include in your programs:

  59990 REM READ ERROR CHANNEL
  60000 IF DS>1 THEN PRINT DS$: STOP
  60010 RETURN

  The  subroutine  reads  the  error channel and puts the results
into  the  reserved  variables  DS  and  DS$.  They  are  updated
automatically by BASIC.
  Two error numbers are harmless -- 0 means everything is OK, and
1  tells  how  many  files  were  erased  by  a  SCRATCH  command
(described  later  in  this  chapter).  If  the  error  status is
anything else,  line 60000 prints the error message and halts the
program.
  Because  this  is  a  subroutine,  you access it with the BASIC
GOSUB  command,  either  in immediate mode or from a program. The
RETURN  statement  in line 60010 will jump back to immediate mode
or the next statement in your program, whichever is appropriate."

"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax and usage of the COPY command on a Commodore 1581 disk with Basic 7.0?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: COPY

  The COPY command allows you to make a spare copy of any program
or file on a diskette. However, on a single derive like the 1581,
the  copy  must  be on the same diskette,  which means it must be
given a different name from the file copied.  The source file and
other files on the diskette are not changed. Files must be closed
before they can be copied or concatenated.

FORMAT FOR THE COPY COMMAND:

  COPY [Ddrive#,]'old file name' TO [Ddrive#,]'new file name'

"In the context of the C64, What precautions should be taken when using the SCRATCH command to delete files, and how to recover from accidentally deleting a file or a splat"" file?""","1581 disk: Scratch in-depth

  SCRATCH  is  a powerful command and should be used with caution
to be sure you delete only the files you really want erased. When
using  it  with  a  pattern,  we  suggest  you first use the same
pattern in a  DIRECTORY  command,  to be sure exactly which files
will  be  deleted.  That  way you'll have no unpleasant surprises
when you use the same pattern in the SCRATCH command.
  If you accidentally SCRATCH a file you shouldn't have, there is
still  a  chance of saving it by using the 'UNSCRATCH' program on
your Test/Demo diskette.

More about Splats

  Never SCRATCH a splat file.  These are files  that show up in a
directory listing with an asterisk (*)  just before the file type
for  an entry.  The asterisk (or splat) means that file was never
properly  closed,  and  thus  there  is  no valid chain of sector
links for the SCRATCH command to follow in erasing the file.
  If you  SCRATCH such a file,  odds are you will improperly free
up  sectors  that are still needed by other programs or files and
cause  permanent damage to those later when you add more files to
the  diskette.  If you find a splat file,  or if you discover too
late  that  you have scratched such a file,  immediately validate
the diskette using the  VALIDATE  command described later in this
chapter.  If  you  have  added  any  files  to the diskette since
scratching  the  splat  file,  it is best to immediately copy the
entire  diskette onto another fresh diskette,  but do this with a
copy  program  rather than with a backup program.  Otherwise, the
same problem will be recreated on the new diskette.  When the new
copy is done,  compare the number of blocks free in its directory
to  the  number  free  on  the original diskette.  If the numbers
match, no damage has been done.  If not, very likely at least one
file  on  the  diskette  has  been  corrupted,  and all should be
checked immediately."
"In the context of the C64, How do you erase a locked file on a diskette that cannot be deleted with the SCRATCH command?","1581 disk: Locked Files

  Occasionally,  a diskette will contain a locked file; one which
cannot  be  erased with the  SCRATCH  command.  Such files may be
recognized  by  the  '<'  character which immediately follows the
file type in their directory entry. If you wish to erase a locked
file, you will have to use a sector editor program to clear bit 6
of  the  file-type  byte  in the directory entry on the diskette.
Conversely, to lock a file, you would set bit 6 of the same byte."

"In the context of the C64, What is the primary interface between the host computer and the 1581 system, responsible for managing file creation, modification, and deletion, and keeping track of file names and free space on the disk?","1581 disk:  CONTROLLER JOB QUEUE

  The  software  in  the  1581's  ROM can be broken down into two
major  components  --  the DOS and the Controller.  The DOS (Disk
Operating  System)  is  the  software  interface between the host
computer  and  the  1581 system.  The DOS keeps track of the file
management details necessary to create,  modify and delete files.
It  monitors  the  amount of free space left on a disk, and keeps
track of the file names in the directory. It remembers where each
file starts, and ensures that none of them overlap. When the host
sends commands,  the DOS checks make sure that the syntax and the
parameters  are  valid.  The  DOS  is very complex,  and its code
occupies the majority of the ROM.

  The  Controller,  on  the  other hand,  knows nothing about the
concept of files. The Controller deals only in the physical world
of  the  disk  itself.  It is responsible for reading and writing
each of the individual sectors on the disk.

  The  DOS  and  Controller  communicate  to each other primarily
through  a  'mailbox',  known  as the Job Queue.  Because the DOS
deals more in the abstract, or logical, world, it does not access
the physical disk itself. If the DOS requires access to the disk,
it must ask the controller to do it.  The DOS places a Controller
Command  Code into the Job Queue and then waits for the requested
operation  to  be  completed.  The Controller polls the Job Queue
every 10 milliseconds  (the polling rate is determined by timer B
of  8520)  looking for something to do.  If there is a job in the
queue,  the Controller executes the job and returns a status byte
to the DOS.  To speed things up, the polling of the job queue can
be  bypassed  by  a  direct  jump  to JSTROBE_CONTROLLER at $FF54
(refer to the section describing the Vectored Jump Table). A call
to JSTROBE_CONTROLLER requires the command in the accumulator and
the job queue offset in the x register.

  Most  of  the tasks that the Controller can be asked to perform
require parameters. The parameters are also placed in a 'mailbox'
location  for  the  Controller  to  access  (prior to placing the
command byte into the queue, of course).  These parameters can be
either the physical or the logical parameters,  depending on what
the command expects to see. Logical parameters are placed in HDRS
as  two consecutive bytes of track,  sector.  Physical parameters
are  also  placed  in  HDRS,  but  in  addition  the side must be
specified  (in  SIDS).  Commands  that require logical parameters
must  translate  them  into  physical parameters at some point in
their  execution.  The  logical  parameters  are  translated into
physical parameters by a vectored routine called TRANSTS, and are
written into  HDRS2  and  SIDS.  The DOS will always pass logical
parameters, and uses only the Controller commands that allowed to
put  jobs  in  its  own  queue,  so  it  needs  to  pass physical
parameters as well as logical.

  Associated with each of the nine  Job Queue  locations  (Jobs 0
through 8) are nine 256 byte buffers (buffers 0-8),  beginning at
location  $0300.  Data passed from/to a particular Job during its
execution  is  located  in  the  buffer  which corresponds to the
position  of  the  Controller  Job  Code  in  the  Job Queue. For
example,  if the  Controller  Code  in  Job Queue  position 2 (at
location  $0004)  requests that a logical sector of data be read,
the data is put into Buffer 2 (at location $0500).

  Table 1 is a list of Controller Job Codes  that can be put into
the  Job Queue.  Table 2 is a list of the codes that are returned
by the Controller once the job has been executed. The return code
is  placed  into  the  Job Queue in the same memory location that
contained the Controller Job Code. Consequently, the procedure to
use the Controller is the following:

  1) Write  any  parameters  needed by the Job into the parameter
     variables (HDRS, HDRS2, SIDS).
  2) Write the Controller Code into the Job Queue (JOBS).
  3) Wait  for  the  job  to  be  completed by simply polling the
     location in JOBS where the Job code was put, and waiting for
     it to change (bit 7 will be reset to 0)."

file name per diskette. It is possible to get around this problem
using the  RENAME  and  SCRATCH  commands described later in this
chapter.  If all you wish to do is replace a program or data file
with a revised version, another command is more convenient. Known
as SAVE-WITH-REPLACE, or @SAVE.  This option tells the disk drive
to  replace  any file it finds in the diskette directory with the
same name, substituting the new file for the old version."
"In the context of the C64, What is the command and its format to erase unwanted files and free up disk space in a C64 system?","1581 disk:  SCRATCH

  The SCRATCH command allows you to erase unwanted files and free
the space they occupied for use by other files. It can be used to
erase either a single file  or several files at once via pattern-
matching.

FORMAT FOR THE SCRATCH COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'SCRATCH0:pattern'

or abbreviate it as:

  PRINT#15,'S0:pattern'

'pattern'  can  be any file name or combination of characters and
wildcard characters.  As usual, it is assumed the command channel
has  already  been  opened  as  file 15.  Although not absolutely
necessary,  it  is  best  to  include the drive number in SCRATCH
commands.
  If  you  check  the  error channel after a SCRATCH command, the
value  for  ET  (error  track)  will tell you how many files were
scratched.  For example,  if your diskette contains program files
named  'TEST',  'TRAIN',  'TRUCK' and 'TAIL', you may SCRATCH all
four,  along  with any other files beginning with the letter 'T',
by using the command:

  PRINT#15,'S0:T*'

Then, to prove they are gone, you can type:

  GOSUB 59990

to  call  the  error  checking  subroutine  given earlier in this
chapter.  If  the  four listed were the only files beginning with
'T', you will see:

  01, FILES SCRATCHED,04,00
  READY.

The '04' tells you 4 files were scratched."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the VERIFY command ?","1581 disk:  VERIFY

  The  VERIFY  command can be used to make certain that a program
file  was  properly  saved  to disk.  It works much like the LOAD
command,  except  that  it  only  compares  each character in the
program  against  the  equivalent  character  in  the  computer's
memory, instead of actually being copied into memory.
  If  the  disk  copy of the program differs even a tiny bit from
the copy in memory, 'VERIFY ERROR' will be displayed, to tell you
that the copies differ. This doesn't mean either copy is bad, but
if they were supposed to be identical, there is a problem.
  Naturally,  there's no point in trying to VERIFY a disk copy of
a program after the original is no longer in memory. With nothing
to compare to,  an apparent error will always be announced,  even
though  the  disk copy is automatically verified as it is written
to the diskette."

This  chapter  describes  some  of the internal operations of the
1581  --  how things work on the 'other side of the fence' of the
host computer.  Experienced programmers may find this information
useful.  The information learned in previous chapters (especially
Chapter 7)  combined with that presented in this chapter provides
a  wide  realm  of  possibilities for the creative and persistent
programmer. Please be reminded, however, of the NOTE presented at
the beginning of Chapter 7 regarding future compatibility."
"In the context of the C64, What is the meaning of the Error 73"" message that appears when reading the disk error channel?""","1581 disk:  One  disk  error  message  is  not  always an error. Error 73,
'COPYRIGHT CBM DOS V10 1581'  will  appear  if  you read the disk
error  channel  before sending any disk commands when you turn on
your computer.  This is a handy way to check which version of DOS
you  are  using.  However,  if  this message appears later, after
other disk commands, it means there is a mismatch between the DOS
used  to  format  your diskette and the DOS in your drive. DOS is
Disk Operating System."
"In the context of the C64, What precautions should be taken when using the SCRATCH command, and what can be done if a file is accidentally deleted?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: in depth scratch:

  SCRATCH  is  a powerful command and should be used with caution
to be sure you delete only the files you really want erased. When
using  it  with  a  pattern,  we  suggest  you first use the same
pattern in a  DIRECTORY  command,  to be sure exactly which files
will  be  deleted.  That  way you'll have no unpleasant surprises
when you use the same pattern in the SCRATCH command.
  If you accidentally SCRATCH a file you shouldn't have, there is
still  a  chance of saving it by using the 'UNSCRATCH' program on
your Test/Demo diskette."
"In the context of the C64, What should you never do to a 'splat file' on a disk, and how can you recover from accidentally doing so?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: More about Splats

  Never SCRATCH a splat file.  These are files  that show up in a
directory listing with an asterisk (*)  just before the file type
for  an entry.  The asterisk (or splat) means that file was never
properly  closed,  and  thus  there  is  no valid chain of sector
links for the  SCRATCH  command to follow in erasing the file. If
you  SCRATCH  such  a file,  odds are you will improperly free up
sectors  that  are  still  needed  by other programs or files and
cause  permanent damage to those later when you add more files to
the diskette.
  If you find a splat file,  or if you discover too late that you
have  scratched  such  a  file, immediately validate the diskette
using the COLLECT command described later in this chapter. If you
have  added  any files to the diskette since scratching the splat
file,  it  is  best  to immediately copy the entire diskette onto
another  fresh  diskette,  but do this with a copy program rather
than with a backup program.  Otherwise,  the same problem will be
recreated on the new diskette. When the new copy is done, compare
the  number of blocks free in its directory to the number free on
the  original diskette.  If the numbers match, no damage has been
done.  If not,  very likely at least one file on the diskette has
been corrupted, and all should be checked immediately."

"In the context of the C64, What is the difference between the logical and physical disk format of the Commodore 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk:  LOGICAL VERSUS PHYSICAL FORMAT

  All  DOS  operations  of  the 1581 are done in 256 byte blocks.
These blocks appear as individually numbered sectors on the disk.
By  going  through the DOS interface via the commands outlined in
this manual, the logical disk format is as follows:

  single sided
  80 tracks (track 1 through track 80)
  40 x 256 byte sectors per track (sector 0 through sector 39)

  Internally,  however,  the 1581 has a different view of things.
The disk is actually formatted as follows:

  double sided (side 0 and side 1)
  80 tracks per side (track 0 through track 79)
  10 x 512 byte sectors per track (sector 1 through sector 10)

  That  is  the  physical  disk  format created whenever a HEADER
(NEW)  command  is  sent  to the 1581 from the host computer. The
physical  format  is different from the logical so that more data
can be squeezed onto each disk.

  All commands sent from the host computer are parsed through the
DOS  (except the BURST commands) and refer to the logical format.
Software  inside the 1581 automatically takes care of the logical
to  physical translations necessary to retrieve the data properly
from the disk."

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the SAVE WITH REPLACE command in disk operations?","1581 disk:  SAVE WITH REPLACE

  If a file already exists, it can't be saved again with the same
name  because  the  disk  drive only allows one copy of any given
file name per diskette. It is possible to get around this problem
using the  RENAME and  SCRATCH commands described later. However,
if  all  you  wish to do is replace a program or data file with a
revised  version,  another  command  is more convenient. Known as
SAVE-WITH-REPLACE, or @SAVE.  This option tells the disk drive to
replace any file it finds in the diskette directory with the same
name, substituting the new file for the old version.

FORMAT FOR SAVE WITH REPLACE:

  SAVE '@drive#:file name',device#

where all the parameters are as usual except for adding a leading
'at' sign (@). The 'drive#:' is required here.

EXAMPLE:

  SAVE'@0:REVISED PROGRAM',8

  The  actual  procedure   is  that  the  new  version  is  saved
completely, then the old version is erased. Because it works this
way,  there  is  little  danger  a  disaster such as losing power
midway  through  the  process  would destroy both the old and new
copies  of the file.  Nothing happens to the old copy until after
the new copy is saved properly."

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and functionality of the Track Cache Buffer in the 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk:  TRACK CACHE BUFFER

  One  of  the  improvements  in  the  1581  design over previous
Commodore  disk  drives  which makes the device more efficient is
the Track Cache buffer. This buffer is located from $0C00 through
$1FFF.  All  disk  accesses involve an entire physical track at a
time.  If  a single sector is needed from a particular track, the
entire  track is read into RAM.  Consequently,  any more requests
for sectors from the same track require only a RAM data transfer,
rather  than  a  search  of  the  track on the disk again. Sector
writes  are also speeded up considerably,  since each consecutive
write  to  sectors  on  the same track requires only a RAM to RAM
data transfer. After data is written into the Track Cache Buffer,
it  is not written to the disk until one of the following occurs:
1) a request is made for access of a sector on a different track,
2) a  'dump  track  buffer'  command is issued,  or  3) after 250
milliseconds of no serial bus activity."

"In the context of the C64, What are the different ways to open a sequential file in BASIC 7.0 and BASIC 2.0, and how can you read and write to these files?","1581 disk with basic 7,0:EXAMPLES OF OPENING SEQUENTIAL FILES:

  To create a sequential file of phone numbers, you could use:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#2,'PHONES',D0,U8,W
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 2,8,2,'0:PHONES,SEQUENTIAL,WRITE'
              or
              OPEN 2,8,2,'0:PHONES,S,W'

  On  the  chance  you've  already  got  a  'PHONES'  file on our
diskette, you can avoid a 'FILE EXISTS' error message by doing an
@OPEN:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#2,'@PHONES',D0,U8,W
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 2,8,2,'@0:PHONES,S,W'

This  erases  all  your old phone numbers,  so make sure that any
information  that  may  be  deleted  is  of  no importance. After
writing  our  phone  file,  remove  the diskette and turn off the
system.  To recall the data in the file, reopen it with something
like:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#8,'PHONES',D0,U8
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 8,8,8,'0:PHONES,S,R'

It doesn't matter  whether the file and channel numbers match the
ones we used before,  but the file name does have to match.  It's
possible  to  use an abbreviation form of the file name, if there
are no other files that would have the same abbreviation:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#10,'PH*',D0,U8
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 10,8,6,'0:PH*,S,R'

  If you have too many phone numbers,  they  might not fit in one
file.  In  that  case,  use  several similar file names and let a
program choose the correct file.

  BASIC 7.0:  100 INPUT'WHICH PHONE NUMBERS FILE (1-3)';PH
              110 IF PH<>1 AND PH<>2 AND PH<>3 THEN 100
              120 DOPEN#4,'PHONE'+STR$(PH),D0,U8

  BASIC 2.0:  100 INPUT'WHICH PHONE NUMBERS FILE (1-3)';PH
              110 IF PH<>1 AND PH<>2 AND PH<>3 THEN 100
              120 OPEN 4,8,2,'PHONE'+STR$(PH)+',S,R'

You can omit the drive number on an OPEN command  to read a file.
Doing  so  allows those with dual drives to search both diskettes
for the file."

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the GET# statement in BASIC, and how is it used to retrieve data from a disk drive?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: READING FILE DATA: USING GET#

  The  GET#  statement  retrieves  data  from the disk drive, one
character  at a time.  Like the similar keyboard GET statement in
BASIC,  it  only  accepts  a  single  character  into a specified
variable. However, unlike the GET statement, it doesn't just fall
through  to  the next statement if there is no data to be gotten.
The  primary  use  of  GET# is to retrieve from diskette any data
that  cannot be read into an INPUT# statement,  either because it
is  too  long  to  fit in the input buffer or because it includes
troublesome characters.

FORMAT FOR THE GET# STATEMENT:

  GET#file#,variable list

where 'file#' is the same file number given in the desired file's
current OPEN statement,  and 'variable list' is one or more valid
BASIC  variable  names.  If  more  than one data element is to be
input by a particular GET# statement,  each variable name must be
separated from others by a comma.
  In practice,  you will almost never see a GET or GET# statement
containing  more  than  one  variable  name.  If  more  than  one
character  is  needed,  a  loop  is  used  rather than additional
variables.  Also  as in the INPUT# statement,  it is safer to use
string  variables  when  the file to be read might contain a non-
numeric character.
  Data in a GET# statement comes in byte-by-byte,  including such
normally  invisible  characters  as  the Carriage Return, and the
various cursor controls.  All but one will be read properly.  The
exception is CHR$(0),  the ASCII Null character.  It is different
from an empty string  (one of the form A$=''),  even though empty
strings are often referred to as null strings.  Unfortunately, in
a GET# statement,  CHR$(0) is converted into an empty string. The
cure is to test for an empty string after a GET#, and replace any
that  are  found  with  CHR$(0) instead.  The first example below
illustrates the method.

EXAMPLES:

  To  read  a file that may contain a CHR$(0),  such as a machine
language program file, you could correct any CHR$(0) bytes with

  1100 GET#3,G$:IF G$='' THEN G$=CHR$(0)

  If an overlong string has managed to be recorded in a file,  it
may be read back safely into the computer with GET#, using a loop
such as this

  3300 B$=''
  3310 GET#1,A$
  3320 IF A$<>CHR$(13) THEN B$=B$+A$: GOTO 3310

The limit for such a technique is 255 characters.  It will ignore
CHR$(0),  but that may be an advantage in building a text string.
If CHR$(0) is required in the file, then add the following line:

  3315 IF A$='' THEN A$=CHR$(0)

  GET# may be useful in recovering damaged files,  or files  with
unknown contents. The BASIC reserved variable ST (the file STatus
variable)  can  be used to indicate when all of a properly closed
file has been read.

  500 GET#2,S$
  510 SU=ST: REM REMEMBER FILE STATUS
  520 PRINT S$;
  530 IF SU=0 THEN 500: REM IF THERE'S MORE TO BE READ
  540 IF SU<>64 THEN PRINT'STATUS ERROR: ST =';SU

Copying  ST into  SU is often an unnecessary precaution, but must
be done  if any other file-handling statement appears between the
one which read from the file  and the one that loops back to read
again.  For example, it would be required if line 520 was changed
to

  520 PRINT#1,S$;

Otherwise,  the  file status checked in line 530 would be that of
the write file, not the read file.

  The  following  table applies to single errors or a combination
of two or more errors.

switches  on  its circuit board,  and writes the device number it
reads  there  into  memory  locations  119  and  120.   Any  time
thereafter, you may write over that device number with a new one,

"In the context of the C64, What are the advantages and types of random access files on Commodore disk drives?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: RELATIVE DATA FILES


  Sequential files are very useful  when you're just working with
a continuous stream of data --  i.e. information that can be read
or written all at once.  However, sequential files are not useful
in some situations.  For  example,  after writing a large list of
mail labels,  you wouldn't want to have to reread the entire list
each time you need a person's record. Instead, you need some kind
of random access, a way to get to a particular label in your file
without having to read through all those preceding it.
  As  an  example,  compare  a  record  turntable with a cassette
recorder. You have to listen to a cassette from beginning to end,
but  a  turntable  needle  can  be  picked  up  at  any time, and
instantly moved to any spot on the record.  Your disk drive works
like a turntable in that respect.  In this chapter you will learn
about a type of file that reflects this flexibility.
  Actually,  two  different  types  of random access files may be
used on Commodore disk drives:  relative files  and random files.
Relative  files  are  much more convenient for most data handling
operations,  but  true  random  access  file  commands  are  also
available  to  advanced users,  and will be discussed in the next
chapter."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of using index files in conjunction with sequential and relative files?","1581 disk:  THE VALUE OF INDEX FILES

  In the last two chapters you have learned how to use sequential
and relative files separately.  But they are often used together,
with the sequential file used to keep brief records of which name
in  the  relative  file is stored in each record number. That way
the  contents  of  the  sequential file can be read into a string
array and sorted alphabetically. After sorting, a technique known
as a binary search can be used to quickly find an entered name in
the  array,  and  read  in  or write the associated record in the
relative  file.  Advanced  programs can maintain two or more such
index files, sorted in differing ways simultaneously."
"In the context of the C64, What are direct access commands used for on a diskette?","1581 disk:  DIRECT ACCESS COMMANDS


  Direct  access  commands  specify  individual  sectors  on  the
diskette,  reading  and  writing  information entirely under your
direction.  This  gives them almost complete flexibility in data-
handling programs, but imposes tremendous responsibilities on the
programmer.  As a result,  they are normally used only in complex
commercial  programs  able to properly organize data without help
from the disk drive itself.
  A far more common use of direct access commands is  in  utility
programs  used  to  view and alter parts of the diskette that are
not normally seen directly.  For  instance,  such commands can be
used to change the name of a diskette  without erasing all of its
programs,  to lock a program so it can't be erased,  or hide your
name in a location where it won't be expected."
"In the context of the C64, What is the concept of organizing data in a relative file, and how does it differ from sequential files in terms of structure and access speed?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: FILES, RECORDS, AND FIELDS

  When learning about sequential files,  you  did not worry about
the organization of data within a file,  so long as the variables
used to write the file  matched up properly with those which read
it  back  into the computer.  But in order for relative access to
work,  you need a more structured and predictable environment for
our data.
  The  structure  you  will  use  is  similar to that used in the
traditional filing cabinet. In a traditional office, all customer
records might be kept in a single file cabinet. Within this file,
each  customer  has a personal record in a file folder with their
name on it,  that contains everything the office knows about that
person.  Likewise,  within  each  file folder,  there may be many
small  slips  of  paper,  each  containing one bit of information
about  that customer,  such as a home phone number or the date of
the most recent purchase.
  In  a  computerized office,  the file cabinet is gone,  but the
concept of a file containing all the information about a group or
topic  remains.  The file folders are gone too, but the notion of
subdividing the file into individual records remains. The slip of
paper  within  the  personal  records  are gone too,  replaced by
subdivisions  within  the records,  called fields.  Each field is
large enough to hold one piece of information about one record in
the  file.  Thus,  within  each  file there are many records, and
within each record there are typically many fields.
  A  relative  file takes care of organizing the records for you,
numbering them from 1 to the highest record number,  by ones, but
the fields are up to you to organize.  Each record will be of the
same size, but the 1581 won't insist that they all be divided the
same way. On the other hand, they normally will be subdivided the
same  way,  and  if it can be known in advance exactly where each
field  starts  within  each  record,  there are even fast ways to
access  a  desired  field within a record without reading through
the  other  fields.  As  all  of this implies,  access speed is a
primary reason for putting information into a relative disk file.
Some  well-written  relative  file  programs are able to find and
read  the record of one desired person out of a thousand in under
15 seconds, a feat no sequential file program could match."

|   The  1581,  as  well  as  other  Commodore  peripherals, is |
| designed   to   support   interfacing  via  software  command |
| structures.  The software commands provided in the 1581 allow |
| for   a   smooth   and  controllable  interface  between  the |
| peripheral  and  CPU.  Although  Commodore  has  provided the |
| mechanism  enabling  users  to  load  and  execute  their own |
| machine language programs within the 1581 system, please keep |
| in mind that Commodore reserves the right to change ROM, RAM, |
| I/O and hardware structure at any time.  Consequently, if the |
| defined software interface is bypassed,  future compatibility |
| of  the  user's machine language software within the 1581 may |
| be in question. The 1581 was not designed primarily as a user |
| programmable  device,  but Commodore recognizes that  certain |
| operations   (such  as  copy  protection)  cannot  be  easily |
| achieved without this ability.                                |


  If  you  find  it  necessary to use machine language within the
1581,  use  the jump table listed in this chapter and Chapter 10.
That  will  lessen the possibility of incompatibility if a future
version of the 1581 changes internally.  Also, let the controller
work for you on the physical level by requesting its help via the
JOB QUEUE.  That  too  will  greatly  increase  the likelihood of
future compatibility."

"In the context of the C64, What are the key features and considerations of the Burst Command Instruction Set (BCIS) for the 1581 disk?","1581 disk:  BURST COMMANDS


  The  Burst  Command  Instruction  Set  (BCIS)  is  a  series of
powerful,  versatile,  and complex commands that enables the user
to format,  read,  and write in numerous formats.  Burst commands
are sent via kernal calls, but the handshaking of data is done by
the user for maximum performance. There is no parameter checking,
so exercise care  when using the BCIS.  For instance,  if a burst
read  with an illegal track address is sent to a 1581,  the drive
will keep trying to find the invalid track.  Reading  and writing
in other formats is automatic if the commands are given in proper
sequence. Please become thoroughly familiar with all the commands
and follow the examples given in this chapter.  It's important to
follow the handshake conventions exactly for maximum performance.
  With the exception of  READ  and  WRITE,  burst commands do not
translate  from  logical to physical track and sector.  All track
and  sector  parameters  refer to physical locations (see Chapter
10).  Burst  sector  READ  and  WRITE  commands provide a flag to
enable logical to physical translation.  If the flag is set,  the
drive  does  the  translation  and  the default logical number of
bytes  per  sector  (256)  is transferred instead of the physical
number of bytes per sector (512)."

"In the context of the C64, What is the format for the RECORD# command in BASIC 7.0 and BASIC 2.0, and how does it work?","FORMAT FOR THE RECORD# COMMAND:

  BASIC 7.0: RECORD#file#,record number[,offset]
  BASIC 2.0: PRINT#15,'P'+CHR$(channel#+96)+CHR$(<record#)+
             CHR$(>record#)+CHR$(offset)

where  'file#'  is  the  file#  specified  in  the  current DOPEN
statement for the specified file,  'record number' is the desired
record number,  'channel#' is the channel number specified in the
current OPEN statement for the specified file,  '<record#' is the
low  byte  of the desired record number,  expressed as a two-byte
integer,  '>record#'  is  the  high  byte  of  the desired record
number,  and an optional 'offset' value,  if present, is the byte
within  the  record  at  which  a  following Read or Write should
begin.
  To fully understand this command,  you must understand how most
integers  are  stored  in computers based on the 6502 and related
microprocessors.   In   the   binary   arithmetic   used  by  the
microprocessor,  it  is  possible to express any unsigned integer
from  0-255  in  a single byte.  It is also possible to store any
unsigned integer from 0-65535 in two bytes, with one byte holding
the  part  of the number that is evenly divisible by 256, and any
remainder  in the other byte.  In machine language,  such numbers
are  written backwards,  with the low-order byte  (the remainder)
first,  followed  by  the  high-order byte.  In assembly language
programs written with the Commodore Assembler,  the low part of a
two-byte  number  is  indicated  by  preceding its label with the
less-than character (<).  Similarly,  the high part of the number
is indicated by greater-than (>).

|   To avoid the remote possibility of corrupting relative file |
| data, it is necessary to give RECORD# command once before the |
| Read or Write access and once after the access.               |
|   Although  this  is  not  necessary  for  the  1581,   other |
| Commodore drives require it. To make your programs compatible |
| with those other drives, it's a good idea to use it.          |

EXAMPLES:

  In  BASIC  7.0,  to  position the record pointer for file #2 to
record number 3, type:

  RECORD#2,3

  In BASIC 2.0,  to position the record pointer for channel #2 to
record number 3, type:

  PRINT#15,'P'+CHR$(98)+CHR$(3)+CHR$(0)

The  CHR$(98)  comes from adding the constant (96) to the desired
channel  number  (2).  (96+2=98)  Although the command appears to
work  even  when  96  is  not  added  to  the channel number, the
constant is normally added to maintain compatibility with the way
RECORD# works in BASIC 7.0.
  Since  3  is  less  than  256,  the  high  byte  of  its binary
representation is 0, and the entire value fits into the low byte.
Since you want to read or write from the beginning of the record,
no offset value is needed.
  Since these calculations quickly become tedious,  most programs
are  written to do them for you.  Here is an example of a program
which  inputs  a  record number and converts it into the required
low-byte/high-byte form:

  450 INPUT'RECORD NUMBER DESIRED';RE
  460 IF RE<1 OR RE>65535 THEN 450
  470 RH=INT(RE/256)
  480 RL=RE-256*RH
  490 PRINT#15,'P'+CHR$(98)+CHR$(RL)+CHR$(RH)

Assuming  RH  and  RL  are calculated as in the previous example,
programs  may  also  use  variables  for  the channel, record and
offset required:

  570 INPUT'CHANNEL, RECORD, OFFSET DESIRED';CH,RE,OF
  630 PRINT#15,'P'+CHR$(CH+96)+CHR$(RL)+CHR$(RH)+CHR$(OF)"

"In the context of the C64, what is the format for the VERIFY command?","FORMAT FOR THE VERIFY COMMAND:

where  'drive#:'  is  an optional drive number,  'pattern' is any
string expression that evaluates to a file name,  with or without
pattern-matching  characters,  and  'device#'  is the disk device
number, normally 8. If the relocate flag is present and equals 1,
the  file  will  be verified where originally saved,  rather than
relocated into the BASIC text area.

A useful alternate form of the command is:

  VERIFY '*',device#

It  verifies  the last files used without having to type its name
or drive number. However, it won't work properly after SAVE-WITH-
REPLACE,  because the last file used was the one deleted, and the
drive  will  try  to  compare  the deleted file to the program in
memory.  No  harm will result,  but 'VERIFY ERROR' will always be
announced.  To  use VERIFY after @SAVE,  include at least part of
the file name that is to be verified in the pattern.

  One  other  note  about  VERIFY  -- when you VERIFY a relocated
BASIC  file,  an  error  will  nearly always be announced, due to
changes  in  the  link  pointers  of  BASIC  programs made during
relocation.  It  is best to VERIFY files saved from the same type
of  machine,  and  identical  memory  size.  For example, a BASIC
program  saved from a Plus/4 can't be verified easily with a C64,
even  when  the  program  would  work fine on both machines. This
shouldn't  matter,  as the only time you'll be verifying files on
machines  other  than  the  one  which wrote them is when you are
comparing  two  disk  files  to see if they are the same. This is
done by loading one and verifying against the other, and can only
be  done  on the same machine and memory size as the one on which
the files were first created."

"In the context of the C64, What is the recommended approach when opening a relative file for the first time to ensure reliable usage and avoid potential issues?","USING RELATIVE FILES: RECORD# COMMAND

  When  a  relative file is opened for the first time,  it is not
quite ready for use. Both to save time when using the file later,
and to assure  that the file will work reliably,  it is necessary
to  create  several records before closing the file for the first
time.  At  a  minimum,  enough records to fill more than two disk
sectors (512 bytes) should be written. In practice, most programs
go ahead  and create as many records as the program is eventually
expected  to  use.  That  approach  has the additional benefit of
avoiding  such  problems  as  running out of room on the diskette
before the entire file is completed.
  If  you  simply  begin  writing  data to a just-opened relative
file,  it will act much like a sequential file,  putting the data
elements  written  by  the  first  PRINT# statement in record #1,
those  written by the second PRINT# statement in record #2 and so
on.  This  means  each  record must be written by a single PRINT#
statement,  using  embedded  carriage  returns within the data to
separate  fields  that  will  be  read  in via one or more INPUT#
statements later. However, it is far better to explicitly specify
which record number is desired via a RECORD# command to the disk.
This  allows  you to access records in any desired order, hopping
anywhere in a file with equal ease."

or  whether  it will fit properly within the current disk sector,
or need to be extended onto the next available sector.  DOS takes
care of all that for you.  All you need to do is specify how long
each  record  is,  in bytes,  and how many records you will need.
DOS  will do the rest,  and organize things in such a way that it
can  quickly find any record in the file,  as soon as it is given
the record number (ordinal position within the file).
  The  only  limit that will concern you is that each record must
be  the  same  size,  and  the  record  length you choose must be
between 2 and 254 characters.  Naturally the entire file also has
to fit on your diskette, along with any other existing file(s)."
"In the context of the C64, How can commas and colons be safely included within a data element when using INPUT or INPUT# statements in BASIC?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: COMMAS (,) AND COLONS (:)

  commas  and colons can cause trouble in a
file,  because they delimit  (end) the data element in which they
appear  and cause any remaining characters in the data element to
be read into the next INPUT# variable.  They have the same effect
in an INPUT statement,  causing the common  'EXTRA IGNORED' error
message.  However,  sometimes  you  really  need a comma or colon
within a data element,  such as a name written as  'Last, First'.
The cure  is to precede such data elements with a quotation mark.
After a quotation mark,  in either an  INPUT or INPUT# statement,
all   other  characters  except  a  carriage  return  or  another
quotation mark are accepted as part of the current data element.

EXAMPLES:

  To force a quotation mark into a data element  going to a file,
append a CHR$(34) to the start of the data element. For example:

  PRINT#2,CHR$(34)+'DOE,JOHN'

or

  PRINT#2,CHR$(34);'DOE,JOHN'

If  you  do  this  often,  some  space  and time may be saved by
previously  defining  a  variable as equal to CHR$(34) as we did
earlier with CHR$(13):

   20 QT$=CHR$(34)
  ...
  400 PRINT#5,QT$+NAME$

  In  each  case,  the added quotation mark will be stripped from
the data  by the  INPUT  or  INPUT#  statement,  but the comma or
colon will remain part of the data."
"In the context of the C64, How does the storage of numeric data on diskettes in BASIC 7.0 differ from its storage in computer memory, and what are some strategies for optimizing disk space when writing numeric data to files?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: NUMERIC DATA STORAGE ON DISKETTE


  Inside the computer,  the space  occupied by a numeric variable
depends  only  on  its  type.  Simple numeric variables use seven
bytes  (character locations) of memory.  Real array variables use
five bytes per array element,  and integer array elements use two
bytes each.  In contrast,  when a numeric variable or any type is
written to a file,  the space it occupies depends entirely on its
length, not its type.  This is because numeric data is written to
a  file  in  the form of a string,  as if the STR$() function had
been  performed on it.  The first character will be a blank space
if the number is positive,  and a minus sign (-) if the number is
negative.   Then  comes  the  number,  digit-by-digit.  The  last
character is a cursor right character.
  This  format allows the disk data to be read back into a string
or  numeric  variable  later.  It is,  however,  wasteful of disk
space,  and  it can be difficult to anticipate the space required
by  numbers  of  unknown  length.  For this reason, some programs
convert all numeric variables into strings before writing them to
diskette,  and  use  string  functions  to  remove  any  unneeded
characters in advance.  Doing so still allows those data elements
to be read back into a numeric variable by INPUT# later, although
file  data  errors  may  be  avoided  by  reading  all data in as
strings, and converting to numbers using the VAL() function after
the information is inside the computer.
  For example, 'N$=RIGHT$(STR$(N),LEN(STR$(N))-1)' will convert a
positive  number  N  into a string  N$  without the usual leading
space for its numeric sign.  Then instead of  writing  PRINT#5,N,
you would use PRINT#5,N$."
"In the context of the C64, What is the format of the OPEN statement to create or reopen a relative file in BASIC 7.0 and BASIC 2.0?","CREATING A RELATIVE FILE

  When a relative file is to be used for the first time, its OPEN
statement will create the file; after that, the OPEN statement is
used to reopen the file for both reading and writing.

FORMAT STATEMENT TO OPEN A RELATIVE FILE:

where  'file#' is the file number,  normally an integer between 1
and 127; 'device#' is the device number to be used, normally 8 on
the  1581;  'channel#'  selects  a particular channel along which
communications  for this file can take place,  normally between 2
and 14;  'drive#' is the drive number,  always 0 on the 1581; and
'file name' is the name of the file,  with a maximum length of 16
characters.  Pattern  matching characters are allowed in the name
when accessing an existing file, but not when creating a new one.
The  record  length is the size of each record within the file in
bytes used, including carriage returns, quotation marks and other
special characters.

"In the context of the C64, What are the two popular ways to organize individual fields of information within a fixed-length relative record, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?","1581 disk: DESIGNING A RELATIVE RECORD

  As  stated earlier in this chapter,  each relative record has a
fixed length, including all special characters. Within that fixed
length, there are two popular ways to organize various individual
fields of information. One is free-format, with individual fields
varying in length from record to record, and each field separated
from the next by a carriage return character  (each of which does
take  up  one character space in the record).  The other approach
is to use fixed-length fields,  that may  or may not be separated
by carriage returns. If fixed length fields are not all separated
by  carriage returns,  you will either need to be sure a carriage
return is included within each 88-character portion of the record
(88 is for BASIC 2, 160 is for BASIC 7). If this is not done, you
will  have  to  use  the  GET#  command  to read the record, at a
significant cost in speed.
  Since  each  relative record is most easily written by a single
PRINT# statement,  the recommended approach is to build a copy of
the current record in memory before writing it to disk. It can be
collected into a single string variable  with the help of BASIC's
many string-handling functions,  and then all written out at once
from that variable.
  Here  is  an  example.  If  we are writing a 4-line mail label,
consisting of 4 fields named  'NAME',  'STREET',  'CITY & STATE',
and 'ZIP CODE', and have a total record size of 87 characters, we
can organize it in either of two ways:

  WITH FIXED LENGTH  FIELDS         WITH VARIABLE LENGTH FIELDS

Field Name     Length             Field Name        Length

NAME           27 characters      NAME              31 characters
STREET         27 characters      STREET            31 characters
CITY & STATE   23 characters      CITY & STATE      26 characters
ZIP CODE       10 characters      ZIP CODE          11 characters
----------------------------      -------------------------------
Total length   87 characters      Potential length  99 characters
                                  Edited length     87 characters

  With fixed length records,  the field lengths add up to exactly
the  record  length.  Since  the  total length is just within the
input  buffer size limitation,  no carriage return characters are
needed.  With variable length records,  you can take advantage of
the  variability  of  actual  address  lengths.  While  one  name
contains  27  letters,  another  may  have only 15,  and the same
variability exists in street and city lengths.  Although variable
length records lose one character per field for carriage returns,
they  can  take advantage of the difference between maximum field
length  and  average  field length.  A program that uses variable
record  lengths must calculate the total length of each record as
it is entered,  to be sure the total of all fields doesn't exceed
the space available."

"In the context of the C64, What are the different addressing modes supported by instructions in a 6510 processor?","Addressing Modes
Each instruction supports one or more addressing
modes. Common instructions like LDA (load accumulator) support more addressing modes than less
common ones (BIT).
• The immediate addressing mode is indicated with
a # sign: LDA #$17 loads the immediate value of
$17 into the accumulator.
• Absolute addressing specifies a 16 bit address as an
operand: LDA $0314 loads from the memory address $0314.
• Zero page addressing is an optimized version of
absolute addressing: LDA $02 will read from address $0002 in memory, but the instruction can be
encoded more tightly, and execution is faster.
• Absolute-X-indexed addressing reads from a specified address, to which the contents of the X register
is added. LDA $0200,X reads from the address
$020A, in case X is $0A. This allows reading from
tables.
• Absolute-Y-indexed is the same thing, but with the
Y register.
• Zero-Page-X-indexed is an optimized version of
Absolute-X-indexed. LDA $F0,X reads from the
Xth location in a table stored starting at $00F0 in
memory. Note that zero page addresses will wrap
around, so $F0 + $10 = $00.
• Zero-Page-Y-indexed is the same thing, but with
the Y register.
• Zero-Page-X-indexed-indirect adds X to a specified
zero page address, reads a 16 bit pointer from the
resulting address and finally accesses memory at
that address. So LDA ($80,X) will read from an
address specified by the array of pointers at $0080
and the index X into the array. This addressing
mode is rarely used.
• Zero-Page-indirect-Y-indexed treats two consecutive bytes in zero page as an address and adds Y to
the address. LDA ($14),Y will read from $E020, if
the address stored at $14/$15 is $E000 and Y is
$20. This addressing mode is the most convenient
way to work with pointers, as no register can hold
16 bits."
"In the context of the C64, What are the instructions and characteristics of the 6502/6510 processor related to register transfer and stack operations?","Register Transfer and Stack
There are several 1 byte instructions without operands that move data between registers. TAX, TXA,
TAY and TYA move between A, X and Y. TSX and
TXS copies between X and the stack pointer.
The stack pointer always points to the next address
that is written to. This means that an empty stack has
a stack pointer of $FF, and pushing a value first
writes the value and then decrements the stack
pointer. The 6502 can move the accumulator from
and to the stack (PHA/PLA), as well as the processor
status P (PHP/PLP)."
"In the context of the C64, What are the different types of instructions that make up the instruction set of the 6510 processor?","Instruction Set
The instruction set is very streamlined, and avoid
redundancies. There are load instructions (LDA/
LDX/LDY to load A, X and Y respecively), store instructions (STA/STX/STY), read-modify-write instructions (logic: ASL/LSR/ROL/ROR, count: INC/
DEC), arithmetic (ADC/SBC; note that these always
include the carry: CLC/ADC is a regular addition, and
SEC/SBC is a regular subtraction, because of the
one's complement logic), compare (CMP/CPX/CPY;
these are subtractions without storing the result),
logic (AND/ORA/EOR, and BIT, which is AND without storing the result), as well as branch instructions,
flag manipulation, register transfer and stack manipulation."
"In the context of the C64, What are the key features and characteristics of the 6502 CPU, including its architecture, registers, and instruction set?","6502 CPU
The CPU inside the C64 is a 0.985 MHz (on PAL)
MOS 6510, which is a close derivative of the wellknown 8 bit little-endian MOS 6502. The 6502 was
introduced in 1975 by MOS Technology, a company
formed earlier the same year by former Motorola engineers, headed by Chuck Peddle. The philosophy of
the 6502 was to have a reduced instruction set and a
small register file, making it simpler and faster than
CPUs like the Z80 at the same clock speed, as well as
cheaper to manufacture.
Unlike other CPUs, the 6502 does not have a set of
general purpose registers. Instead, it has a single accumulator A (for arithmetic and logic), two index registers X and Y (for incrementing, decrementing and
indexing memory) and a stack pointer. All these registers are 8 bits. The processor status, consisting of
the negative (N), overflow (V), break (B), decimal (D),
interrupt (I), zero (Z) and carry (C) flags is exposed as
register P. The program counter (PC) is 16 bits wide.
The fact that the stack pointer is 8 bit means that the
stack is confined to the area between $0100 and
$01FF in the address space, i.e. the upper half of the
effective stack pointer is hard-coded to $01. There is
another special area in the address space: The first
256 bytes, at $0000 to $00FF are referred to as the
zero page (ZP). Many instructions support special
encodings for zero page addresses, which saves one
byte in the instruction encoding as well as at least one
cycle of execution time. This can be seen as an extension of the register file to another 256 (though external) registers.
All opcodes are one byte, and have 0, 1 or 2 byte operands. The 8x8 opcode matrix is somewhat logical
(e.g. branch instructions are encoded as $10, $30,
$50, ...), but there is no easy rule to construct the opcode table. Nevertheless, the opcode table is a minimal encoding for optimal decoding in the 6502's internal PLA ROM."
"In the context of the C64, What is the history of the Commodore 64, including its development, features, and impact on the computer market?","History of the C64
Commodore Business Machines was founded in 1962
by Jack Tramiel. The company specialized on electronic calculators, and in 1976, Commodore bought the chip manufacturer MOS Technology and decided to have Chuck Peddle from MOS evolve their KIM-1 computer kit (a design that demos their new MOS 6502 8 bit CPU) into the Commodore PET series: computers with built-in monitors for the home, school and small business market that ended up competing with devices from Atari and Apple. In 1981, Commodore introduced the VIC-20, a 5 KB stripped down monitorless computer-in-thekeyboard design based on the PET for the home computer market. This was followed by the (incompatible) higher-end Commodore 64 in 1982 that included more PET features, came with 64 KB of RAM (an immense amount compared to the rest of the market) and was very aggressively priced at US$595 beating the competition by a factor of two. This was made possible by designing and building most of the system in-house. Although some features of the C64 were taken from the PET models of the time, it had to be connected to a TV set, which only made 40 columns of text possible (as opposed to 80 columns on the PET). Also, the BASIC 4.0 codebase was stripped down to the old 2.0 feature set to make it fit into 8 KB.
In the beginning, the C64 did well in the competition. The superior but compatible C128 from 1985 did well, too, but was never more popular than the C64, which continued to be sold. The direct successor to the lowend VIC-20, the 1984 Plus/4 and its siblings, the C16 and the C116, failed, mostly because they were incompatible with the C64, which at that time already had a remarkable software library. A few years after the introduction, the C64 was still offered as a low-end alternative to the Commodore Amiga, and while it became less popular in the USA,
it gained more and more popularity in Europe. In the early 90s, when manufacturing costs of a C64 were as low as $25, it gained a second life in Eastern Europe.
Production did not end until the liquidation of Commodore in 1994. According to the 1993 Annual Report, 17 million C64 had been produced in by then, as
well as 4.5 million C128."
"In the context of the C64, What are the key features, capabilities, and technical specifications of the Commodore 64 (C64) computer?","Look and Feel
A C64 only needs to be connected to power and a TV set (or monitor) to be fully functional. When turned on, it shows a blue-on-blue theme with a startup message and drops into a BASIC interpreter derived from
Microsoft BASIC. In order to load and save BASIC programs or use third party software, the C64 requires mass storage - either a “datasette” cassette tape drive or a disk drive like the 5.25' Commodore 1541.
Unless the user really wanted to interact with the BASIC interpreter, he would typically only use the BASIC instructions LOAD, LIST and RUN in order to access mass storage. LOAD'$',8 followed by LIST shows the directory of the disk in the drive, and
LOAD'filename',8 followed by RUN would load and start a program. If a tape drive is connected, LOAD and RUN will launch the first program on tape - pressing SHIFT and the RUN/STOP key has the same effect.

By default, typing characters without SHIFT will result in upper case characters being shown on the screen. This can be changed by pressing the Commodore key and SHIFT at the same time, which switches to the upper/lower character set. This behavior is due to the fact that the first PET only had uppercase characters, and that BASIC required keywords unshifted - but all tutorials taught them as uppercase. This is also the reason why in Commodore's version of ASCII, called PETSCII, the codes for uppercase and lowercase characters are reversed.
The text based user interface is not a line editor, but a screen editor, i.e. the cursor can be moved freely on the screen, and pressing RETURN on a line with existing text will present the text to the application as if it were just typed in.
While a physical screen line is only 40 characters, the screen editor logic can extend it to a logical 80 characters - whenever a character is entered on the 40th column, the rest of the screen is moved down by one line, ”opening” a line that extends the previous line to 80 characters.
The C64 screen editor supports selecting one out of 16 color for the foreground text by pressing the key combinations Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+8 and Commodore+1 to Commodore+8. Reverse text mode can be turned on and off with Ctrl+9 and Ctrl+0.


Ports and Connections
The C64 has a whole range of connection possibilities.
On the side, it has two 9 pin Atari-style joystick connectors that can also be used for a mouse, light pens or paddles. On the back, there is the expansion port, which exports the complete processor bus, allowing not only game cartridges but also cartridges with I/O chips that map themselves into the CPU's address space - or even cartridges that completely replace the CPU. For a conventional TV connection, there is an RCA connector that outputs an RF signal. For monitors, there is an extra DIN connector that carries separate chroma, luma and audio signals (S-Video).
For connecting Commodore compatible printers and disk drives, there is a DIN connector for the IEC bus.
There is also a dedicated connector for datasette drives. The ”User Port” consists of several GPIO pins that can be used for custom hardware projects, or as a RS-232 port (with TTL levels), for which support exists in the ROM."
"In the context of the C64, What is the memory mapping of the Commodore 64's 6510 CPU, including the address ranges for RAM, ROM, I/O devices, and other components?","Address Space
The 8 bit C64 design has a 16 bit address bus, allowing the CPU to address 64 KB of memory. Since the
C64 has 64 KB of RAM, filling the complete address
space, ROM and I/O chips are mapped into regions of
the address space that are shared with RAM: The
CPU can switch these regions between RAM and a
second or third mapping. These regions are as follows:
• $0000-$9FFF: RAM
• $A000-$BFFF: RAM or BASIC ROM
• $C000-$CFFF: RAM
• $D000-$DFFF: RAM or memory mapped I/O
chips or character ROM
• $E000-$FFFF: RAM or KERNAL ROM
In contrast to CPUs like the Z80 and the 8086, and
like most modern CPUs, I/O devices are memory
mapped on the C64's 6510 CPU. The mapping is as
follows:
• $D000-$D3FF: VIC video controller
• $D400-$D7FF: SID sound controller
• $D800-$DBFF: Color RAM
• $DC00-$DCFF: CIA 1 I/O controller
• $DD00-$DDFF: CIA 2 I/O controller
• $DE00-$DFFF: for extensions on the expansion
port"
"In the context of the C64, What are the components that make up the Commodore 64 motherboard?","Board
On the C64 motherboard, there is a dedicated IC each for the main tasks. There is the MOS 6510 CPU, eight 64 KBit RAM chips (later consolidated into 2), three ROM chips with KERNAL (I/O library), BASIC and the character set (KERNAL and BASIC were later consolidated), two 6526 CIA I/O controllers (one for keyboard and joystick, one for the IEC bus and the user port), the 6581 SID sound chip, and the 6567/6569 VIC video chip, as well as the RAM chip that holds the 512 bytes of Color RAM.
All non-RAM chips are custom chips designed manufactured by MOS, Commodore's inhouse chip company."
"In the context of the C64, What are the memory layout and addressing capabilities of the VIC chip in a Commodore 64 computer?","Memory Layout
The VIC can address 16 KB at a time. All VIC data
structures can be stored anywhere in these 16 KB, but
they have to be aligned to their size.
• The screen RAM is $0400 bytes in size and can be
at $0000, $0400, ...
• The character set is $0800 bytes, and can be at
$0000, $0800, ...
• The bitmap is $2000 bytes and can be at $0000 or
$2000.
• Sprites are $40 bytes, and can be at $0000,
$0040, ...
Two GPIO pins of the second 6526 CIA are connected
to bits 6 and 7 of RAM when the VIC accesses it. By
changing the lower 2 bits of $DD02, the VIC can be
switched between banks $0000-$3FFF (11), $4000-
$7FFF (10), $8000-$BFFF (01) and $C000-$FFFF
(00).
If the VIC is set to banks $0000 or $8000, then the
two built-in character sets shadow RAM in the area of
$1000-$1FFF. This means that the built-in character
set can be used on those banks without occupying
RAM, but it also means that the area from $1000-
$1FFF cannot be used for bitmap, screen RAM or
sprite data either.
For timing reasons, color information is not taken
from main RAM, but from a dedicated Color RAM.
These $0400 half-bytes are accessible to the C64 at
$D800-$DBFF and can not be bank switched."
"In the context of the C64, What are the characteristics and capabilities of the VIC's hardware sprites (MOBs) on the Commodore 64?","Sprites
The VIC has eight hardware sprites (also called
MOBs, movable objects). Each sprite is 24x21 pixels,
which is encoded in 63 bytes. Set bits will be drawn in
the sprite's individual foreground color, and cleared
bits will be transparent. The index to the sprite's bitmap data in memory is an 8 bit value that is read
from the last 8 bytes of screen RAM - since the screen
is only 1000 characters, the last 24 characters of the
$0400=1024 bytes area would otherwise be unused.
There is also a multicolor mode for sprites, which
makes pixels twice as wide and decreases the horizontal resolution to 12 pixels. In this mode, 00 is still
transparent, and 10 encodes the sprite's individual
color. The codes 01 and 11 take the color out of the
sprite multicolor registers ($D025 and $D026),
which are shared among all sprites.
Sprites can be positioned at arbitrary pixel positions
on the screen, and overlap. In this case, sprites with
lower numbers have priority over sprites with higher
numbers. Each sprite can either be shown in front or
behind background pixels. Sprites can be X- and Yexpanded by a factor of two, and collision of two
sprites or of a sprite and background pixels is detected by hardware: Whenever two non-transparent
sprite pixels are drawn at the same position on the
screen, they have collided. Whenever a nonbackground pixel is drawn by the character generator
at the same position where a non-background pixel of
a sprite is draw, the sprite has collided with the background. An exception from this rule is the 01 code in
the character data, which also counts as background.
This way, a background picture can be constructed
that does not cause collisions in certain areas. In
practice, most newer games do not use the hardware
functionality, but instead test for overlapping sprite
bounding boxes in software."
"In the context of the C64, How does the VIC chip handle graphics modes, including hi-res and multi-color bitmap modes, in terms of resolution, pixel encoding, and color management?","Bitmap Mode
In hi-res graphics mode, the VIC supports a resolution of 320x200, which uses the same pixel frequency
as 40x25 character mode (40*8=320, 25*8=200).
The bitmap can reside at $0000 or $2000, and the
VIC reads one byte for 8 pixels. But hi-res mode does
not only support monochrome graphics: The foreground and background colors of each 8x8 tile are
taken from the high and low nibble of screen RAM,
which would otherwise be unused. Color RAM is not
used in this mode.
The encoding of the bitmap is identical to the encoding of a character set, making it a non-linear framebuffer: The first eight bytes of the bitmap represent
the pixels in the tile at character position (0,0), the
second eight bytes represent the tile at character position (1,0), which is pixel position (8,0), and so on.
This layout makes pixel addressing in software
slower.
In Multi-Color Bitmap Mode, the horizontal resolution is halved to 160x200, and pixels are twice the
width. Every set of two bits in the encodes one of four
colors per tile: 00 takes it from the global background
register ($D021), 01 and 10 take it from the upper
and lower nibble of screen RAM, respectively, and 11
takes it from Color RAM."
"In the context of the C64, How does the VIC support scrolling and what are the implications for screen mode and border size?","Scrolling
The VIC supports hardware X and Y scrolling by 0 to
7 pixels. Since the 40th column is half visible and another column left of the first column is half-visible
when the horizontal shift register is set to e.g. 4, a
41th column would be needed. Instead, it is possible
to switch the screen to 38 column mode, i.e. the
whole screen is a little narrower, and more border is
shown on the left and on the right. The screen can
also be switched from 25 to 24 lines the same way."
"In the context of the C64, What is the memory configuration of a Commodore 64 system, including how the ROMs and I/O area can be altered, and how programs typically utilize the available memory?","Memory Configuration
In a running system with BASIC and KERNAL, the
BASIC and KERNAL ROMs are turned on and visible
at $A000-$BFFF and $E000-$FFFF respectively,
and at $D000-$DFFF, the I/O area is visible. Using
the 3 lowest bits in the processor port at address 1,
this configuration can be altered. The ROMs can be
turned off, revealing RAM instead, and the I/O area
can be configured to show either RAM or the character set ROM. Note that writing to ROM will always
direct the data to the underlying RAM.
In practice, many programs run in the default configuration and use both KERNAL library routines, as
well as functions in BASIC, to keep their own code as
small as possible. More recent programs and almost
all games turn off all of ROM, to get direct control of
the interrupt vector without having to go though the
KERNAL handler first. The I/O area is typically configured to show the I/O registers and Color RAM, and
only rarely switched to a different configuration to
temporarily access the RAM underneath. A few applications read the character ROM at program start and
modify the copy.
The C64 supports another ROM bank at $8000-
$9FFF, which can only be serviced by an external cartridge connected to the expansion port. If KERNAL
detects the magic string ”CBM80” at $8004 on
startup, it will jump to the code of the cartridge right
away."
"In the context of the C64, What are the characteristics and modes of the Commodore 64's character display system?","Character Mode
The C64 has two built-in character sets that the VIC
can access. They can be shown on the screen by writing the numbers 0 to 255 into screen RAM (at $0400
by default). The default font has uppercase characters
and lots of line-drawing symbols in the lower 128
characters, and the second half consists of the same
characters, but inverse. The alternative font has upper- and lowercase characters and omits some of the
symbols.
The foreground color of the characters can be
changed by writing the color numbers into the Color
RAM, which is located at $D800-$DBFF. There is
one byte per character, but only the lower 4 bits are
actually preserved by Color RAM.
Each character is 8x8 pixels, and stored as eight bytes
in the character ROM, one line being one byte. A 1-bit
will take the color from the Color RAM ($D800-
$DBFF), and a 0 bit will take it from the global background color register ($D021). The pixel matrix is
determined by looking up the character index in the
screen RAM (at $0400-$07FF by default) and consequently looking up the pattern the current character
set (the VIC sees the default font at $1000, although
for the 6502 it is invisible there).
In Extended Color Mode (ECM), it is possible to
chose between one of four background colors (registers $D021 to $D024) with the upper two bits of the
character index, but then only 6 bits will be used to
look up the character pattern, decreasing the number
of possible characters to 64. The built-in (uppercase)
character set is well-suited for this: While it is similar
to the ASCII encoding, it has the uppercase characters
mapped to codes $01 to $1A, so the most important
characters are within the first $40.
Multi-Color Character Mode allows up to four colors
per character and is intended for tile-based games,
like platformers. If bit 3 of the value in Color RAM is
0, then the character gets displayed just like in nonmulticolor mode, but colors are restricted to the first
eight. If bit 3 is 1, then pairs of horizontally adjacent
bits are combined in their meaning: 00 represents the
screen background ($D021), 01 is the second background register ($D022), 10 is the third background
register ($D023), and 11 is the color specified in bits
0-2 of the Color RAM. Pixels in these characters are
twice as wide, so the resolution of a character is 4x8."
"In the context of the C64, What are the features and capabilities of the MOS 6567/6569 VIC-II video chip in the Commodore 64?","6567/6569 VIC
The video chip inside the C64 is called the MOS
6567/6569 VIC-II (Video Interface Controller) - the
video chip in the VIC-20 had been the original VIC,
and was the reason for the marketing name of the
VIC-20.
The VIC supports a 40x25 text mode, a 320x200 bitmap mode, 16 colors and 8 sprites - all of these features have lots of sub-modes and options. The
amount of memory the VIC can address is 16 KB, and
while by default, it accesses the first 16 KB of the C64
RAM, it can be configured to use any of the four
banks.
The 16 colors of the VIC are divided into two sets of
eight. The first eight are the more important colors,
as some modes only support the first eight. The colors
are, in the original order: black, white, red, cyan, purple, green, blue, yellow, orange, brown, pink, dark
gray, gray, light green, light blue and light gray."
"In the context of the C64, What are the key aspects of the VIC's timing that are essential to understand for advanced programming and achieving cycle-exact timing in assembly code?","Timing
For advanced VIC programming, it is necessary to not
just set up a certain mode and have the VIC display it,
but to reprogram the VIC while it is drawing the picture. For this, it is necessary, to understand its timing.
While the pixels within the screen area are 320 by
200, the VIC actively draws pixels in the border color
outside of this area, which (on PAL) is 403x284 pixels. Analog TV standards specify an H blank area at
the end of every line, and V blank area at the end of
every screen. So counting this timing as pixels, this
gives an absolute resolution of 504x312 pixels. The
interesting and very useful connection about the pixel
clock and the system clocks is that an 8 pixel character is drawn every system clock cycle, i.e. about 1 million times a second. The 504 horizontal pixels therefore mean that a line is drawn on the screen every 63
cycles. With this information, it is possible to do
cycle-exact timing of assembly code to switch a VIC
register at an 8 pixel granularity.
Further timing details (badlines, sprite timing), as
well as the application of this information to do tricks
like FLD, FLI and AGSP would go beyond the scope
of this article."
"In the context of the C64, What are the components and connections of the tape interface?","Tape Interface
The tape interface consists of a single line each for
data input and output, motor control and key sense.
The raw data is read from and written to the data
lines, and all encoding and decoding of the data
stream is done in software. 3 of the required lines are
connected to the processor port at zero page location
1, and one (data input) is connected to CIA 2."
"In the context of the C64, What is the IEC bus and how does it work on Commodore computers?","IEC Bus
The IEC bus is a serial version of the IEEE-488 bus
used on the PET. Devices on the IEC bus are daisychained, and are all connected to the same three
lines: ATN (attention), clock and data. IEC has a single bus master, which is the computer. It is the only
device to ever raise ATN, while every device can output to clock and data, depending on the state of the
bus.
If the computer raises ATN, every device on the bus
listens for the 4 bit device number and compares it
with its own. The protocol on who sends and who receives is determined by the computer sending TALK/
UNTALK and LISTEN/UNLISTEN requests, quick is an ATN sequence, followed by one of the four commands.
While KERNAL exports the interface at this level, it
also allows high-level open, close, read and write operations on the IEC bus, as well as load and save operations. The BASIC LOAD and SAVE commands are
directly hooked up to this interface.
The IEC bus was designed for the serial shift register
in the VIA (Versatile Interface Adapter) of the VIC-20
and its disk drive, but it turned out that the VIA had a
bug that made the shift register unusable, so the IEC
protocol had to be implemented in software. While
the C64 has CIAs, in which the bug has been fixed,
the 1541 still used VIAs. It wasn't until the C128 (in its
native mode only) that the computer could talk to the
floppy drive (Commodore 1570/1571/1581) in its intended speed."
"In the context of the C64, What was the graphical user interface-based operating system released by Berkeley Softworks in 1986 for the Commodore 64?","GEOS
While KERNAL is a minimal character-based operating system in ROM, there is also a disk-based operating system with a graphical user interface for the C64.
GEOS was released by Berkeley Softworks in 1986
and Commodore bundled it with the C64 for some
time. The GUI, which can be controlled by a joystick
or a mouse, runs in 320x200 graphics mode and resembles early versions of MacOS. GEOS is a 16 KB
library that includes an optimized disk interface
(faster, support for timstamps, icons and multi-fork
”VLIR” files), library code for drawing to the screen,
high level UI primitives for menus, buttons and dialog boxes (with callbacks) and a simple memory
swapping facility. Furthermore GEOS allows input
and printer driver plugins, as well as proportional
fonts in different sizes. Internally, GEOS has a jump
table to its library routines that consists of about 150
entries.
GEOS came with applications like GeoPaint and GeoWrite; Berkeley Softworks themselves offered solutions like GeoPublish and GeoCalc, and more software was available from third parties.
GEOS' only requirement is a 1541 disk drive, but a
3.5' 1581 drive, a RAM extension or one of the later
hard drives helped speed it up a lot."
"In the context of the C64, What are the features and uses of the 6526 CIA (Complex Interface Adapter) in the Commodore 64 computer?","6526 CIA
The C64 has two identical 6526 CIAs (Complex Interface Adapter) that are mostly used for I/O. One CIA
features 16 general purpose I/O pins (8 bit port A and
8 bit port B) that can be used either as an input or an
output, two programmable timers and a real-timeclock.
The timers have 16 bit counters and count down by
one either on each clock cycle, or on an external
event, or on a timer A underflow (in the case of timer
B). This allows concatenating the timers to one 32 bit
timer. On an underflow, the CIA can be programmed
to cause an IRQ or to send data through a serial shift
register. The CIA also supports receiving data
through a shift register.
The real-time-clock has a resolution of 1/10 of seconds and supports generating interrupts at a certain
time.
CIA 1 is hooked up to the keyboard and the joystick
ports. Since the keyboard consists of 64 keys (plus
SHIFT LOCK, which is parallel to the left SHIFT key,
and RESTORE, which is directly connected to the
CPU's NMI line), these can be laid out in a 8x8 matrix
of lines, key presses connecting the intersections. One
side of the matrix is connected to port A (output), and
the perpendicular side is connected to port B (input).
The keyboard driver can now write the values of $01,
$02, $04 etc. in port A and test the input of port B to
see which keys are pressed. The two joysticks are
connected in parallel to port A and port B, so they can
cause spurious keyboard events.
CIA 2 is hooked up to the IEC bus, and I/O lines control the VIC bank. The rest is exposed on the user
port, and can be used for RS-232.
KERNAL uses CIA 1 for the 50 Hz system timer, but,
apart from the ports, doesn't use any of the extra features of either CIA."
"In the context of the C64, What are the various peripherals and accessories that were developed for the Commodore 64 (C64) computer?","Other Peripherals
The 1541 is the necessary companion to a C64. It can
be replaced by a 1570 (1541 with fast bus routines for
the C128) or a 1571 (double-sided 1570), since they
include a 1541 compatibility mode. The 3.5' Commodore 1581, which supports 880 KB per disk, can
hardly be a replacement for a 1541, because most applications contain their own floppy speeders that
make lots of assumptions on the exact on-disk format. For GEOS, it can be very useful though.
Creative Micro Devices sold and continues to sell a
line of hard drives that have an IEC connection but
contain a 3.5' SCSI drive inside. Although they have a
6502 CPU built in and allow code execution on their
CPU, they are not compatible enough to replace a
1541 either.
Several memory extension cartridges exist for the
expansion port of the C64: The Commodore REU
(contains a DMA chip that transfers data between
itself and main RAM), as well as the third party
GeoRAM (maps a block to the $DE00-$DFFF area)
and RAMLink (battery backed, designed as RAM
disk).
Freezer cartridges like the Action Replay and the Final Cartridge were not only popular because they
could dump all of memory to disk and thus copy certain copy-protected games, but also because they featured floppy speeders that disabled the original routines directly at startup time, without any effort from
the user.
In the mid 90s, CPU speeders for the expansion port
became popular. The 8 MHz Flash 8 is rare today, but
many enthusiasts have a SuperCPU, which replaces
the onboard CPU with a 20 MHz 65C816, which has a
native 16 bit mode that can address up to 16 MB or
RAM. There are a few applications and games that
require a SuperCPU. The speedup of GEOS with a
SuperCPU is significant.
In the 2000s, the enthusiast scene created all kinds of
peripherals, like ethernet interfaces, IDE interfaces
and SD card readers.
And there are not only peripherals: In 2004, the
Commodore 64 DTV, a reimplemented C64 appeared
in the form of a Joystick. The device is fairly compatible and can be extended to connect to a keyboard and
a 1541."
"In the context of the C64, What is the role and functionality of the KERNAL I/O library in Commodore 8-bit systems, particularly in the Commodore 64?","KERNAL
The C64 has an 8 KB I/O library at $E000-$FFFF
which is utilized by BASIC, but is intended to be used
by other applications as well. All Commodore 8 bit
systems have a standardized library call interface in
the form of jump tables at the very top of memory
that call into machine-specific functions for I/O.
KERNAL is started form the RESET vector, initializes
the machine, sets up an interrupt service routine that
handles the keyboard, animates the cursor and does
the real time clock. The C64 has a hardware clock in
each of the CIA chips, but KERNAL has not been updated to use this feature since the VIC-20.
KERNAL provides an abstract character I/O interface
to a number of devices. All devices support open,
read, write and close. The open call takes three parameters: The logical file number (there is a maximum of 16 channels), the device number and the secondary address. There are 16 device numbers statically assigned to the devices. The 8 bit secondary address can signal something to the device, like speed or
an operation mode. Some devices (tape and IEC)
support an optional filename.
Device 0 is the keyboard. While KERNAL exports raw
key presses, the keyboard can also be accessed
through character I/O, which will go through the
screen editor and replay all characters on the screen
that are in the line of the cursor, regardless of
whether the user typed them or they had been there
before.
Device 1 is the tape drive. KERNAL reads and writes
blocks of data at a time and buffers them for character I/O.
Device 2 is RS-232. KERNAL contains a very sophisticated (but rarely used) software RS-232 implementation that supports up to 2400 baud.
Device 3 is the screen. KERNAL interprets special
codes, manages the cursor position and handles
scrolling.
Devices 4 to 15 will be directed to the IEC bus. By
convention, devices 4 to 7 are printers and plotters,
and devices 8 to 15 are floppy or hard disks.
KERNAL allows interacting with the IEC bus manually by sending TALK and LISTEN requests to the
bus."
"In the context of the C64, What is the history and features of Microsoft BASIC and its variations, including Commodore BASIC, on early home computers?","BASIC
Microsoft had a strong position in the market for
(mostly ROM) BASIC interpreters in 8080-based
home computers when the MOS 6502 was released in
1975, so they rewrote their interpreter in 6502 assembly. Microsoft BASIC was pure 6502 code with a
minimal character I/O interface to the machine's
”monitor”, i.e. I/O library.
Commodore decided to license the interpreter for the
1977 PET and extended it slightly to interface with
their disk and tape libraries. Commodore BASIC was
very buggy, so they went back to Microsoft for an update, which, with the Commodore changes re-applied,
shipped in newer PETs as BASIC V2. For version 4,
Commodore added several extensions, both language
constructs as well as support for graphics and sound.
Being a low-end machine, Commodore took the bugfixed BASIC V4 codebase and removed all features
after V2, making it independent of the machine's
graphics and sound features again, and fitting it back
into 8 KB, and shipped this version on the VIC-20.
The Commodore 64 got the exact same version, except that it runs at a different memory address
($A000-$BFFF).
Microsoft BASIC is a line-based editor, that is, lines
can be shown with the LIST command, and they can
be modified by re-typing them. This integrates nicely
with the KERNAL screen editor: The cursor can be
moved up to LISTed lines, the lines can be modified,
and when RETURN is pressed, the whole line is fed
into BASIC again.
4
A nice feature of this and later versions of Commodore BASIC is the fact that all important parts, like
the tokenizer, the detokenizer and the interpreter
loop jump over a jump table in RAM before they do
their work, allowing the user to extend BASIC arbitrarily. The most well-known BASIC extension is Simons' BASIC, a cartridge that maps 8 KB of extra
ROM at $8000-$9FFF."
"In the context of the C64, What are the technical specifications and features of the Commodore 1541 Disk Drive used with the Commodore 64?","1541 Disk Drive
The Commodore 1541 Disk Drive is the most common
disk drive used with the C64. It uses 5.25' SS/DD
(single side, double density) disks, but disks can be
flipped, and the other side can be used as well, if the
disks are double sided. The 1541 does not use the index hole, and uses software markers (SYNC) instead
to be able to tell the start of a sector. Due to reliability
problems of early drives, the 1541 only uses 35 out of
the 40 possible tracks on a 5.25' disk. The tracks have
a variable number of 256 byte sectors, ranging from
21 on the outside to 17 on the inside. The data is written in 4 different speeds. This makes an overall 683
sectors, or 174,848 bytes.
The file system is stored on track 18. Track 18, sector
0 contains the disk name and the BAM (block availability map), which stores one bit per sector (1 = free).
Track 18, sector 1 is the first sector containing directory entries: There are eight 32 byte entries per sector, with a maximum filename length of 16 characters. The first two bytes of a directory sector point to
the next directory entry sector.
The files on disk are also stored as a linked list. The
first two bytes of every sector are either the track and
sector number of the next block, or the first byte is 0
and the second byte is the number of valid bytes in
this sector.
The 1541 is a stripped down version of the PET drive
series, which had a parallel connection, and contained two 6502 CPUs: One for doing the filesystem
and communicating with the computer, and one for
reading data from disk and writing data to it, as well
as encoding and decoding the data. The 1541 only has
a single 6502 CPU running at 1 MHz, which (using
timer IRQs) regularly switches itself between the two
modes. The two virtual CPUs still communicate with
each other using a messaging interface in the zero
page. The 1541 has 2 KB of RAM at $0000-$07FF.
The 1541 has two VIA I/O controllers at $1800 (for
the IEC bus) and at $1C00 (for the drive). The firmware is located at $C000-$FFFF.
Since loading an application or a game takes minutes
on an unmodified C64, several ”floppy speeders” appeared (either as software on disk or built into applications, as ROM extension cartridges, or as internal
replacement ROMs), that consisted of implementations of more optimized protocols for the IEC bus for
both the C64 and the 1541. The 1541 code was uploaded using the old bus protocol. Such a new protocol would for example not do a handshake on every
bit using the clock line, but shift a complete byte
through in 4 steps, two bits at a time, using the clock
and data line at the same time. This would of course
only work if both CPUs were not interrupted. VIC
timing on the C64 side could already affect this, so
many floppy speeders turned off the screen while
loading."
"In the context of the C64, How many cycles do different types of instructions take on a 6502 processor?","Cycle Counting
It is quite straightforward to find out how many cycles an instruction takes. As a rule of thumb, an instruction takes as many cycles as the number of
memory fetches it has to perform, but at least two.
Therefore, single-byte opcodes (one byte fetches;
NOP/TAX/INX etc.) as well as instructions with immediate operands take two cycles. Zero page instructions take three memory accesses (opcode, address,
data), so they are three cycles. Absolute instructions
take four accesses (opcode, address low, address high,
data), so they are four cycles.
Read-modify-write instructions (INC/DEC/shift/
rotate) are an exception: They require 4 memory accesses for the zero page case and 5 otherwise, but they
take 5 and 6 cycles, respectively.
Branches take 3 cycles if they are taken and two if
they are not taken. And extra cycle has to be added if
the branch crosses a page boundary. JMP is 3, push is
3, pull is 4, JSR and RTS are 6 each.
All other timings can be looked up in the 6502's reference, but they are very easy to memorize."
"In the context of the C64, What are some common tricks and optimizations used when programming the 6502 microprocessor?","Common Tricks
• The BIT instruction exists in a two-byte (immediate operand) and three-byte (absolute operand)
variant. Since BIT only changes the flags, it effectively skips one or two bytes in the instruction
stream. This can be used to replace a two-byte
branch or a three-byte JMP with a one-byte BIT if
only one or two bytes have to be skipped.
• The architecture allows safe self-modifying code so a common optimization for copy loops is to use
LDA $nn00,X and STA $mm00,X, looping X from
$00 to $FF and then incrementing the bytes that
encode nn and mm for the next page. Compared toa LDA (zp1),Y: STA (zp2),Y sequence, this gets the
inner loop down from 16 cycles (5 LDA, 6 STA, 2
INY, 3 BNE) to 14 (4 LDA, 5 STA, 2 INY, 3 BNE).
• A PHA/PLA combination is 7 cycles, while an STA/
LDA combination in the zero page is 6 cycles, so
unless there is no free zero page space, PHA/PLA
should be avoided to quickly store a value. Using
an absolute store to write the value into the operand of a future immediate load (i.e. self modification) is the same speed at the zero page solution,
but does not waste zero page space.
• An elegant way to store a flag is to have it in bit #7
of a zero page address. While a load/store combination has to be used to set the flag, it can be
cleared with a simple LSR (5 cycles) and tested
with BIT (3 cycles), without affecting register contents.
• Since the 6502 is so register starved, only 3 bytes
can be passed to a subroutine in registers. Also, the
stack is small, and accessing it is slow, so stack
frames as seen on modern architectures are very
uncommon. Many applications and libraries (e.g.
GEOS) use a dedicated area in the zero page as virtual registers.
• The 6502 has no instructions for multiplication,
division or floating point arithmetic. Most 6502-
based computers have a BASIC interpreter in ROM
though, and they typically include a math and
floating point library."
"In the context of the C64, What are the key differences between the MOS 6510 used in the Commodore 64 and the generic MOS 6502, and how does it interact with other components on the C64?","The MOS 6510
Except for the pin layout, the MOS 6510 that is used
in the C64 differs from the generic MOS 6502 in two
ways: It can make the bus tri-state when not used, so
the VIC can use it, and it has a 6 bit I/O port built in,
which can be controlled using zero page locations 0
and 1. In register 0, each bit from 0-5 set it to output
if 1, and to input if 0. Bits 0-5 in register 1 are the actual I/O pins. On the C64, bits 0-2 are outputs and
control bank switching, they turn the ROMs and the
I/O area on and off. Bits 3-5 go to the tape connector
and control the motor and the data sent to the head,
and detect whether a key on the tape deck is pressed."
"In the context of the C64, What are some of the bugs and quirks of the original 6502 microprocessor implementation?","Bugs and Quirks
The original 6502 implementation has a series of
bugs and other anomalies that have never been fixed
in MOS chips (not counting the 65CE02, which was
only used in Amiga peripherals).
• The indirect version of JMP loads the program
counter from the wrong address, if the vector's address lies on a page boundary: JMP ($23FF) will
read the address from $23FF and $2300 instead of
$23FF and $2400.
• When in decimal mode, the negative flag reflects
the original binary result, not the effective decimal
result.
• If a software interrupt (BRK) and a hardware interrupt occur at the same time, the BRK is dropped.
• Read instructions (LDA/AND etc.) with the
absolute-indexed addressing mode first read from
the absolute address without the index register
added, and then read again from the correct address. LDX #$07 LDA $D019,X will first read from
$D019, discard the result, and then read from
$D020. On the C64, this read form $D019 would
ACK all pending VIC interrupts, while it is only
supposed to read the border color ($D020).
• Read-modify-write instructions with absolute addresses first read the value, but one cycle before
they store the result, they store the original value
again. On a C64, this can be seen when incrementing the screen border color at a defined area of the
screen, as every write to the register will cause a
tiny gray dot on the screen. When this is used with
certain I/O ports, this can have other side effects.
The latter two quirks have been used heavily for
obfuscating copy protection software.
• Instruction decoding in the 6502 is done by a PLA
that compares the current cycle number within the
instruction and the current opcode against a ROM
of 130 mask lines, of which any number can fire
independently. The outputs of these lines are then
fed into components like the ALU, bus control, register control and program counter logic. The instruction set only consists of 151 defined opcodes,
and since handling the remaining 105 opcodes as
NOPs or traps would have required extra lines in
the PLA, they will match against some lines that
were meant for instructions with similar opcodes.
Some of these ”illegal opcodes” lead to useful results and are used in some software (SAX = store A
& X), but most of the instructions make little sense
(SHX = store X & the upper 8 bits of the program
counter), and some even lock up the CPU, disabling IRQs and NMIs (CRA/KIL)."
"In the context of the C64, What are the effects of flags and branches on 8-bit load and logic instructions, and how do conditional branches and decimal mode work in a 6502/6510 processor architecture?","Flags and Branches
All load and logic instructions set N and Z accordingly, shift instructions also modify C, and arithmetic
instructions touch N V, Z and C. The D (decimal), I
(interrupt disable) and C flags can be set and cleared
programmatically (CLD/SED, CLI/SEI, CLC/SEC),
while the V flag can only be cleared (CLV). Conditional branches are possible based on the value of the
negative (BPL/BMI), overflow (BVC/BVS), zero
(BNE/BEQ) and carry (BCC/BCS) flags. Branches
encode an 8 bit relative offset and can therefore reach
code in the area of +127 and -128. Since a compare is
the same as a subtraction, BCC is a branch on (unsigned) below, and BCS is a branch on above-orequal.
NOP
NOP (no operation) does nothing. Its encoding is
$EA.
Decimal Mode
If the D flag is set, all ADC and SBC operations will be
BCD-adjusted afterwards, i.e. $09+$02 won't be $0B,
but $11, since 9+2=11. The BCD correction circuit has
been patented in US patent 3,991,307."
"In the context of the C64, What are the different types of control transfer instructions and interrupts available on C64, and how do they function?","Control Transfer
Next to the absolute JMP instruction, there is an indirect version that jumps over a vector (e.g. JMP
($FFFC)). JSR (jump to subroutine) only has an absolute version, and stores the address of the next instruction minus one on the stack. RTS (return from
subroutine) takes the address from the stack, adds
one, and moves it into the program counter. The ”minus one” logic was chosen because it could save one
cycle in the implementation of JSR.
A hardware interrupt, unless disabled by a set interrupt (I) flag, pushes the address of the next instruction minus one (just like JSR), pushes the processor
status afterwards, disables interrupts, and jumps over
the vector at $FFFE/$FFFF. RTI return from interrupt) is the same as the combination of PLP and RTS.
BRK causes a software interrupt and behaves the
same as a hardware interrupt, except that it sets the B
flag on the stack to 1 (a hardware interrupt sets it to 0)
NMIs behave the same as IRQs, but they cannot be
masked, and they use the $FFFA/$FFFB vector. The
reset vector is at $FFFC/$FFFD."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function that returns the natural logarithm of a number X?","basic: LOG(X)  (logarithm)

EXP(X)). To convert to log base 10, simply divide by LOG(10)."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the PRINT# statement in BASIC programming?","basic: PRINT#

  There are a few differences between this statement and PRINT. PRINT# is
followed by a number,  which refers to the device or data file previously
OPENed.  This number is followed by a comma and a list to be printed. The
comma and semicolon have the same effect as they do in PRINT. Please note
that some devices may not work with TAB and SPC.

  100 PRINT#1, 'DATA VALUES'; A%, B1, C$"
"In the context of the C64, What is the format and syntax of the DATA statement in a programming language?","basic: DATA

  This  statement  is  followed  by  a  list  of items to be used by READ
statements.  Items  may  be numeric values or text strings, and items are
separated  by commas.  String items need not be inside quote marks unless
they contain space,  colon, or comma.  If two commas have nothing between
them, the value will be READ as a zero for a number, or an empty string.

  DATA 12, 14.5, 'HELLO, MOM', 3.14, PART1"
"In the context of the C64, What should you do if you purchased peripheral equipment, such as a VIC 1541 disk drive or a VIC 1525E printer?","Audio System
  If you purchased peripheral equipment, such as a VIC 1541 disk drive or
a VIC 1525E printer,  you may wish to connect it at this time.  Refer  to
the  user's  manuals  supplied  with  any  additional  equipment  for the
procedure for connecting it to the computer."
"In the context of the C64, What are the registers and procedures involved in creating and moving sprites in a graphics program?","basic: Sprites

 you need to know what
picture making locations control the functions you need. These locations,
called registers, could be illustrated in this manner:

  Register(s)   Description

   0            X coordinate of sprite 0
   1            Y coordinate of sprite 0
   2 - 15       Paired like 0 and 1 for sprites 1-7
  16            Most Significant Bit -- X coordinate
  21            Sprite appear: 1 = appear, 0 = disappear
  29            Expand sprite in 'X' Direction
  23            Expand sprite in 'Y' Direction
  39-46         Sprite 0-7 color

  In  addition  to  this  information you need to know from which 64 byte
section sprites will get their data (1 byte is used).
  This data is handled by 8 locations directly after screen memory:

        | 2040 | 2041 | 2042 | 2043 | 2044 | 2045 | 2046 | 2047 |
     SPRITE 0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7

  Now let's outline the exact procedure to get things moving  and finally
write a program.
  There  are  only a few things necessary to actually create  and move an
object.

  1. Make the proper sprite(s) appear on the screen by POKEing into
     location 21 a 1 for the bit which turns on the sprite.
  2. Set sprite pointer (locations 2040-2047) to where sprite data should
     be read from.
  3. POKE actual data into memory.
  4. Through a loop, update X and Y coordinates to move sprite around.
  5. You can, optionally, expand the object, change colors,  or perform a
     variety  of  special  functions.  Using  location  29 to expand your
     sprite in the 'X' direction and location 23 in the 'Y' direction."
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to start programming in BASIC on a Commodore 64?","basic: how to start ?

Clear the screen by holding down the <SHIFT> key, and then depressing the
<CLR/HOME> key.
Type NEW and press <RETURN>. (This just clears out any numbers that might
have been left in the computer from your experimenting.)
Now type the following exactly as shown  (remember to hit <RETURN>  after
each line)

  10 ? 'COMMODORE 64'

"In the context of the C64, What are the editing options and techniques available to correct mistakes in a line of text?","basic:  Editing Tips

  If you make a mistake on a line, you have a number of editing options.

1. You can retype a line anytime,  and the  computer  will  automatically
   substitute the new line for the old one.
2. An unwanted line can be erased by simply typing the  line  number  and
   <RETURN>.
3. You can also easily edit an existing line,  using the cursor keys  and
   editing keys.

   Suppose you made a typing mistake in a line of the example. To correct
it without retyping the entire line, try this:
  Type LIST, then using the <SHIFT> and <CRSR UP/DOWN> keys together move
the  cursor  up  until  it  is  positioned  on  the line that needs to be
changed.
  Now,  use  the  cursor-right  key  to  move the cursor to the character
you  want  to  change,  typing the change over the old character. Now hit
<RETURN> and the corrected line will replace the old one.
  If you need more space on the line, position the cursor where the space
is needed and hit  <SHIFT>  and  <INST/DEL>  at the same time and a space
will  open  up.  Now  just  type  in  the  additional information and hit
<RETURN>.  Likewise,  you  can  delete unwanted characters by placing the
cursor to the right of the unwanted character and hitting the  <INST/DEL>
key."
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to set up and troubleshoot a Commodore 64 computer?","USING THE COMMODORE 64

1. Turn  on  the computer using the rocker switch on the right-side panel

3. If your TV has a manual fine tuning knob,  adjust the TV until you get
   a clear picture.
4. You  may also want to adjust the color and tint controls on the TV for
   the best display. You can use the color adjustment procedure described
   later to get everything setup properly.  When you first get a picture,
   the  screen  should appear mostly dark blue,  with a light blue border
   and letters.

"In the context of the C64, What are the types of variables used in Commodore 64 BASIC and how are they specified?","basic: VARIABLES

  The Commodore 64 uses three types of variables in BASIC. These are real
numeric, integer numeric, and string (alphanumeric) variables.
  Variable  names  may consist of a single letter, a letter followed by a
number, or two letters.
  An  integer  variable  is specified by using the percent (%) sign after
the  variable name.  String variable have the dollar sign ($) after their
name.

Examples

  Real Variable Names: A, A5, BZ
  Integer Variable Names: A%, A5%, BZ%
  String Variable Names: A$, A5$, BZ$"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the DEF FN command in a programming language?","basic: DEF FN

  This  command  allows you to define a complex calculation as a function
with a short name.  In the case of a long formula that is used many times
within the program, this can save time and space.
  This  function  name  will  be  FN and any legal variable name  (1 or 2
characters long).  First you must define the function using the statement
DEF  followed  by  the  function  name.  Following  the  name is a set of
parentheses enclosing a numeric variable. Then follows the actual formula
that  you want to define,  with the variable in the proper spot.  You can
then 'call' the formula, substituting any number for the variable.

  10 DEF FN A(X) = 12 * ( 34.75 - X / .3 )
  20 PRINT FN A(7)"
"In the context of the C64, What are the basic syntax and usage of the POKE and PRINT statements in a programming language?","basic: POKE

  POKE is always followed by two numbers, or formulas. The first location
is a memory location; the second number is a decimal value from 0 to 255,
which  will  be  placed in the memory location,  replacing any previously
stored value.

  10 POKE 53281,0
  20 S = 4096 * 13
  30 POKE S + 29, 8

PRINT

  The  PRINT  statement  is  the  first one most people learn to use, but
there  are  a  number of variations to be aware of. PRINT can be followed
by:

  Text String with quotes
  Variable names
  Functions
  Punctuation marks

  Punctuation  marks  are used to help format the data on the screen. The
comma   divides  the  screen  into  four  columns,  while  the  semicolon
suppresses  all  spacing.  Either mark can be last symbol on a line. This
results  in the next thing PRINTed acting as if it were a continuation of
the same PRINT statement.

  10 PRINT 'HELLO'
  20 PRINT 'HELLO', A$
  30 PRINT A + B
  40 PRINT J;
  50 PRINT A, B, C, D

  Also see: POS, SPC and TAB functions."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the basic function INT(X) in a programming language?","basic: INT(X)

  Returns the truncated value of X, that is,  with all the decimal places
to the right of the decimal point removed. The result will always be less
than, or equal to, X. Thus, any negative numbers with decimal places will
become the integer less than their current value."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the ON command in BASIC programming?","basic: ON

  This command turns the GOTO and GOSUB commands into special versions of
the IF statement. ON is followed by a formula, which is evaluated. If the
result of the calculation is one, the first line on the list is executed;
if the result is 2, the second line is executed, and so on. If the result
is 0,  negative,  or  larger  than  the  list  of numbers,  the next line
executed will be the statement following the ON statement.

  10 INPUT X
  20 ON X GOTO 10,20,30,40,50"
"In the context of the C64, What is the mathematical function that returns the value of e (approximately 2.718) raised to the power of a given number?","basic: EXP(X)

  Returns the value of the mathematical constant e (2.71827183) raised to
the power of X."
"In the context of the C64, What are the rules for assigning a name to a variable in BASIC?","basic: variable names: 

  In  assigning  a  name  to a variable there are a few things to keep in
mind.  First,  a  variable name can have one or two characters. The first
character  must  be  an  alphabetic  character  from  A to Z;  the second
character  can  be either alphabetic or numeric (in the range 0 to 9).  A
third character can be included to indicate the type of variable (integer
or text string), '%' or '$'.
  You can use variable names  having more than two alphabetic characters,
but  only the first two are recognized by the computer.  So PA and PARTNO
are the same and would refer to the same variable box.
  The  last  rule  for  variable names is simple:  they can't contain any
BASIC keywords  (reserved  words)  such as GOTO, RUN, etc.  Refer back to
Appendix D for a complete list of BASIC reserved words."
"In the context of the C64, What are the different types of operators in programming, including their symbols and uses, and how do they interact with each other in an expression?","basic: OPERATORS

  The arithmetic operators include the following signs:

  +  Addition
  -  Subtraction
  *  Multiplication
  /  Division
  ^  Raising to a power (exponentiation)

  On a line  containing  more than one operator,  there is a set order in
which operations always occur. If several operations are used together on
the  same  line,  the  computer  assigns  priorities  as follows:  First,
exponentiation. Next, multiplication and division, and last, addition and
subtraction.
  You can change the order of operations  by enclosing within parentheses
the calculation to be performed first. Operations enclosed in parentheses
will take place before other operations.
  There are also operations for equalities and inequalities:

  =  Equal To
  <  Less Than
  >  Greater Than
  <= Less Than or Equal To
  >= Greater Than or Equal To
  <> Not Equal To

  Finally, there are three logical operators:

  AND
  OR
  NOT

  These are used most  often  to  join  multiple  formulas  in  IF...THEN
statements. For example:

  IF A=B AND C=D THEN 100  (Requires both parts to be true)
  IF A=B OR  C=D THEN 100  (Allows either part to be true)"
"In the context of the C64, What are the optional connections available on the Commodore 64 and how can they be utilized?","c64 Optional Connections

  Since the Commodore 64 furnishes a channel of high fidelity sound,  you
may wish to play it through a quality amplifier to realize the best sound
possible.   In addition,  the  Commodore  64  also  provides  a  standard
'composite' video signal, which can be fed into a television monitor.
  These  options  are made possible by the audio/video output jack on the
rear panel  of the Commodore 64.  The easiest way to gain access to these
signals is by using a standard 5-Pin DIN audio cable (not supplied). This
cable connects directly to the audio/video connector on the computer. Two
of  the  four pins on the opposite end of the cable contain the audio and
video signals.  Optionally,  you can construct your own cable,  using the
pinouts shown in Appendix I as a guide.
  Normally,  the  BLACK  connector  of  the  DIN cable supplies the AUDIO
signal.  This  plug  may  be  connected  to  the  AUXILIARY  input  of an
amplifier,  or the AUDIO IN connector of a monitor or other video system,
such as a video cassette recorder (VCR).
  The  WHITE  or  RED connector usually supplies the direct VIDEO signal.
This  plug is connected to the VIDEO IN connector of the monitor or video
input section of some other video system, such as a VCR.
  Depending  on  the manufacturer of your DIN cable,  the color coding of
the plugs may be different.  Use the pinouts shown in Appendix I to match
up the proper plugs  if you don't get an audio or video signal  using the
suggested connections."
"In the context of the C64, What is the concept in programming that allows for the creation of lists of variables with the same name, using extra numbers to specify the element of the list, and how are they defined and used in Commodore 64 BASIC?","basic: Arrays are lists of variables with the same name,  using extra  numbers
to specify the element of the array.  Arrays are defined  using  the  DIM
statement, and may contain floating point, integer,  or string variables.
The array variable name is followed by a set of parentheses ( ) enclosing
the number of variables in the list.

  A(7), BZ%(11), A$(50), PT(20,20)

  NOTE:  There are three variable names which are reserved for use by the
Commodore 64, and may not be defined by you.  These variables are: ST, TI
and  TI$.   ST  is  a  status  variable  which  relates  to  input/output
operations.  The value of ST will change  if there is a problem loading a
program from disk or tape.
  TI and TI$ are variables which relate to the real-time clock built into
the Commodore 64. The variable TI is updated every 1/60th of a second. It
starts at 0 when the computer is turned on, and is reset only by changing
the value of TI$.
  TI$  is a string which is constantly updated by the system.  The  first
two characters contain the number of hours , the  3rd and 4th  characters
the number of minutes,  and  the 5th and 6th characters are the number of
seconds.  This  variable  can  be  given  any numeric value,  and will be
updated from that point.

  TI$ = '101530' sets the clock to 10:15 and 30 seconds AM.

  This clock is erased when the computer is turned  off,  and  starts  at
zero when the system is turned back on."
"In the context of the C64, How does the antenna switchbox facilitate the connection between the Commodore 64 and a TV?","No additional connections are required to use the c64 with your TV. The antenna switchbox will
connect the computer to the TV when the slide switch is in the 'computer'
position.  When  the switch is in the 'TV' position your set will operate
normally."
"In the context of the C64, What is the concept in programming languages that allows you to store and label a value, such as a number or string of text characters, in a computer's memory?","basic:  Variables

  Variables  are  some  of  the  most  used  features  of any programming
language,  because  variables  can represent much more information in the
computer.  Understanding how variables operate will make computing easier
and allow us to accomplish feats that would not be possible otherwise.
  Imagine a number of boxes within the computer that can hold a number or
a string of text characters.  Each of these boxes is to be labeled with a
name  that  we choose.  That name is called a variable and represents the
information in the respective box.
  For example, if we say:

  10 X% = 15
  20 X = 23.5
  30 X$ = 'THE SUM OF X% + X ='

  The computer might represent the variables like this:

  X%  15

  X   23.5

  X$  THE SUM OF X% + X =

  A  variable  name  represents  the  box,  or memory location, where the
current  value  of  the variable is stored. As you can see, we can assign
either  an  integer  number, floating point number, or a text string to a
variable.
  The '%' symbol  following  a  variable name indicates the variable will
represent  an  integer  number.  The following are valid integer variable
names:

  A%
  X%
  A1%
  NM%

  The  '$'  following  the  variable  name  indicates  the  variable will
represent a text string. The following are examples of string variables:

  A$
  X$
  MI$

  Floating  point  variables  follow  the  same  format,  with  the  type
indicator:

  A1
  X
  Y
  MI"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the basic function FN xx(X) in a programming language?","basic: FN xx(X)

FN xx(X) statement."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the OPEN statement in Commodore 64 BASIC programming?","basic: OPEN

  Then  OPEN  statement allows the Commodore 64 to access devices such as
the cassette recorder and disk for data,  a printer,  or even the screen.
OPEN  is followed by a number (0-255),  to which all following statements
will  refer.  There is usually a second number after the first,  which is
the device number.
  The device numbers are:

  0   Screen
  1   Cassette
  4   Printer
  8   Disk

  Following the device number may be a third number, separated again by a
third number, separated again by a comma, which is the secondary address.
In the case of the cassette,  this is 0 for read,  1 for write, and 2 for

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and characteristics of the REM statement in a program?","basic: REM  (Remark)

  REMark  is a note to whomever is reading a LIST of the program.  It may
explain  a section of the program,  or give additional instructions.  REM
statements  in no way affect the operation of the program,  except to add
to its length. REM may be followed by any text."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function that returns the absolute value of a number, without its sign, and always returns a positive answer?","basic: ABS(X)  (absolute value)

  ABS  returns  the absolute value of the number,  without its sign (+ or
-). The answer is always positive."
"In the context of the C64, What is the formula to generate a random number within a specific range in BASIC programming?","basic:  Random Numbers and Other Functions

The RND instruction is generating random numbers

  PRINT INT(6*RND(1))+1,

The general formula for generating a set of random numbers in a certain
range is:

  NUMBER=INT(LOWER+(UPPER-LOWER+1)*RND(1))"
"In the context of the C64, What items should you find in the Commodore 64 container besides the manual?","Before  attaching  anything to the computer,  check the contents of the
Commodore  64  container.  Besides  a  manual,  you  should  find  the
following items:

  1. Commodore 64
  2. Power supply (black box with an AC plug and supply cord)
  3. Video cable
  4. TV Switchbox (small silver box with short antenna leads).

  If any items are missing  check back with your dealer immediately for a
replacement."
"In the context of the C64, What is the memory map structure used to store character and color information on the Commodore 64's screen?","COLOR MEMORY MAP

For every spot on the Commodore 64's
screen  there are two memory locations,  one for the character code,  and
the  other  for  the color code.  The color memory map begins at location
55296 (top left-hand  corner),  and continues on for 1000 locations.  The
same color codes, from 0-15, that we used to change border and background
colors can be used here to directly change character colors."
"In the context of the C64, What are the components and their functions located on the side panel of a Commodore 64 computer?","SIDE PANEL CONNECTIONS

  1. POWER SOCKET.  The  free  end  of the cable from the power supply is
     attached here to supply power to the Commodore 64.
  2. POWER SWITCH. Turns on power to the Commodore 64.
  3. GAME PORTS.  Each  game  connector  can  accept  a  joystick or game
     controller  paddle,  while the lightpen can only be plugged into the
     game port closest to the front of your computer."
"In the context of the C64, How do sprites work on the Commodore 64 and how are they controlled?","basic:  Sprite Creation

  Sprites are controlled by a separate picture-maker in the Commodore 64.
This  picture maker handles the video display.  It does all the hard work
of  creating  and  keeping  track  of  characters and graphics,  creating
colors, and moving around.
  This display circuit has 46 different 'ON/OFF' locations which act like
internal  memory  locations.  Each  of these locations breaks down into a
series of 8 blocks. And each block can either be 'ON' or 'OFF'. We'll get
into  more  detail  about this later.  By POKEing the appropriate decimal
value  in  the  proper  memory location you can control the formation and
movement of your sprite creations.
  In  addition  to accessing many of the picture making locations we will
also be using some of the Commodore 64's main memory to store information
(data) that defines the sprites. Finally, eight memory locations directly
after  the  screen memory will be used to tell the computer exactly which
memory area each sprite will get its data from."
"In the context of the C64, What is the process to change text colors and create a rainbow effect in a basic printing system?","basic: PRINTing Colors

you  can  change  text colors by simply holding the <CTRL> key and one of
the color keys.  

You have a full range of 16 text colors to work with.  Using <CTRL> key
and a number key, the following colors are available:

     1        2        3        4        5       6        7        8
   Black    White     Red     Cyan    Purple   Green    Blue    Yellow

  If  you  hold  down the <C=> key along with the appropriate number key,
these additional eight colors can be used:

     1        2        3        4        5       6        7        8
   Orange   Brown   Lt.Red    Gray 1  Gray 2  Lt.Green  Lt.Blue  Gray 3

Type NEW,  and experiment with the following.  Hold down the <CTRL> key
and  at  the  same  time hit the <1> key.  Next,  hit the <R> key without
holding down the <CTRL> key.  Now,  while again depressing the <CTRL> key
at the same time hit the <2> key.  Release the <CTRL> key and hit the <A>
key. Move through the numbers, alternating with the letters, and type out
the word RAINBOW as follows:"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the WAIT command in a programming language?","basic: WAIT

  WAIT  is  used  to  halt  the  program  until  the contents of a memory
location changes in a specific way. WAIT is followed by a memory location
(X) and up to two variables. The format is:

  WAIT X,Y,Z

  The  contents  of the memory location are first exclusive-ORed with the
third  number,  if  present,  and  then  logically  ANDed with the second
number.  If  the  result  is  zero,  the program goes back to that memory
location  and  checks  again.  When  the  result  is nonzero, the program
continues with the next statement."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the READ statement in programming?","basic: READ

  READ  is  used to assign information from DATA statements to variables,
so the information may be put to use. Care must be taken to avoid READing
strings where READ is expecting a number, which will give a TYPE MISMATCH
ERROR."
"In the context of the C64, What is the mathematical function that returns the angle, measured in radians, whose tangent is X?","basic: ATN(X)  (arctangent)

  Returns the angle, measured in radians, whose tangent is X."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the RESTORE statement in a program?","basic: RESTORE

  When  executed  in  a  program,  the pointer to which an item in a DATA
statement will be READ next is reset to the first item in the list.  This
gives you ability to re-READ the information. RESTORE stands by itself on
a line."
"In the context of the C64, What is the formula to calculate the memory location on the Commodore 64 screen, and how would you use it to determine the memory location of a ball bouncing on the screen at column 20, row 12?","basic:   Screen  memory  in  the Commodore 64 normally begins at memory location
1024,  and ends at location 2023.  Location 1024 is the upper left corner
of the screen. Location 1025 is the position of the next character to the
right  of that,  and so on down the row.  Location 1063 is the right-most
position of the first row. The next location following the last character
on a row is the first character on the next row down.

  Now,  let's  say that you're controlling a ball bouncing on the screen.
The ball is in the middle of the screen,  column 20, row 12.  The formula
for calculation of the memory location on the screen is:

  POINT = 1024 + X + 40 * Y

where X is the column and Y is the row.
  Therefore, the memory location of the ball is:
  POKE 1524, 81
  POKE 55796, 1"
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to connect a Commodore 64 computer to a TV?","CONNECTIONS TO TV:
Connect the computer to your TV as shown below.
1. Attach one end of the TV cable to the phono type TV signal jack at the
   rear of the Commodore 64. Just push it in. Either end of the cable can
   be used.
2. Connect the other end of the cable to the antenna switchbox. Just push
   it in.
3. If you have a VHF antenna, disconnect it from your TV set.
4. Connect your VHF antenna cable to the screw terminals labeled 'antenna
   input'  on  the  switchbox.  If your antenna cable is the round 75-ohm
   coax  type,  use  a 75-ohm to 300-ohm adapter (not supplied) to attach
   your antenna cable to the switchbox.
5. Connect the twin lead output cable of the antenna switchbox to the VHF
   antenna  terminals  of  your  TV set.  If your set is one of the newer
   types  with  a round 75-ohm VHF connector,  you will need a 300-ohm to
   75-ohm converter (not supplied) to connect the switchbox to the 75-ohm
   VHF antenna input on the set.
6. Set  the  TV's  VHF  tuner  to  the  channel  number  indicated on the
   computer's  channel selector switch (channel 3  move the switch to the
   left,  channel 4  move the switch to the right).  If a strong local TV
   signal  is present on one of these channels,  select the other channel
   to avoid possible interference.
7. Plug  the  power supply cable into the power socket on the side of the
   Commodore 64.  Just  push  it in.  It is 'keyed' to allow insertion in
   only one direction, so you can't connect the power cord the wrong way.
   The power supply converts household current into the form the computer
   uses."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and functionality of the GET command in BASIC programming?","basic:  GET

  GET  allows  you  to  input  one  character at a time from the keyboard
without  hitting  <RETURN>.  This  really  speeds  entering  data in many
applications.  Whatever  key  is hit is assigned variable to the variable
you specify with GET.
  The following routine illustrates how GET works:

  NEW

   1 PRINT '{CLR/HOME}'
  10 GET A$: IF A$ = '' THEN 10
  20 PRINT A$;        
  30 GOTO 10          

If you RUN the program,  the screen will clear  and each time you hit a
key, will  print  it  on  the  display,  and  then GET another
character. It is important to note that the character entered will not be
displayed  unless you specifically PRINT it to the screen,  as we've done
here."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the NEXT statement in a FOR loop?","basic: NEXT

  NEXT  is  always  used in conjunction with the FOR statement.  When the
program  reaches a NEXT statement,  it checks the FOR statement to see if
the limit of the loop has been reached.  If the loop is not finished, the
loop  variable  is increased by the specified STEP value.  If the loop is
finished,  execution  proceeds  with  the  statement following NEXT.
  NEXT  may  be  followed by a variable name,  or list of variable names,
separated by commas.  If there are no names listed, the last loop started
is the one being completed. If variables are given, they are completed in
order from left to right.

  10 FOR X = 1 TO 100: NEXT"
"In the context of the C64, What are the explanations and examples of the INPUT# and LET statements in BASIC programming?","basic: INPUT#

  INPUT#  is  similar  to INPUT,  but takes data from a previously OPENed
file or device.

  10 INPUT#1, A

LET

  LET  is  hardly  ever  used  in programs, since it is optional, but the
statement is the heart of all BASIC programs.  The variable name which is
to  be  assigned  the  result of a calculation is on the left side of the
equal sign, and the formula in the right.

  10 LET A = 5
  20 LET D$ = 'HELLO'"
"In the context of the C64, What happens when you run a BASIC program that uses the INPUT statement to prompt the user for input, and how can you exit the program?","basic: INPUT


To get an idea of how INPUT works,  type  NEW  <RETURN>  and enter this
short program:

  10 INPUT A$
  20 PRINT 'YOU TYPED: ';A$
  30 PRINT
  40 GOTO 10
  RUN
  ? COMMODORE 64 
  YOU TYPED: COMMODORE 64 

  What  happens  when  you  run this simple program. A question mark will
appear,  indicating  that  the  computer  is  waiting  for  you  to  type
something. Enter any character, or group of characters, from the keyboard
and  hit  <RETURN>.  The  computer  will  then  respond with 'YOU TYPED:'
followed by the information you entered.
You  can  INPUT  either numeric or string variables,  and even have the
INPUT statement prompt the user with a message. The format of INPUT is:

  INPUT 'PROMPT MESSAGE';VARIABLE


Or, just:

  INPUT VARIABLE

NOTE:  To  get out of this program hold down the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE>
keys."
"In the context of the C64, How does the Commodore 64's screen memory map work and how can characters be displayed on the screen?","basic: SCREEN MEMORY MAP

  Since  the  computer's screen is capable of holding 1000 characters (40
columns by 25 lines)  there are 1000 memory locations set aside to handle
what  is placed on the screen.  The layout of the screen could be thought
of as a grid, with each square representing a memory location.
  And  since  each location in memory can contain a number from 0 to 255,
there  are  256  possible  values for each memory location.  These values
represent  the  different  characters  the  Commodore 64 can display (see
Appendix E).  By  POKEing  the  value  for a character in the appropriate
screen  memory  location,  that character will be displayed in the proper
position."
"In the context of the C64, What are the different connections and interfaces available on the rear of a Commodore 64 computer?","REAR CONNECTIONS

  4. CARTRIDGE SLOT.  The rectangular slot to the left accepts program or
     game cartridges.
  5. CHANNEL SELECTOR.  Use  this  switch  to select which TV channel the
     computer's picture will be displayed on.
  6. TV CONNECTOR.  This connector supplies both the picture and sound to
     your television set.
  7. AUDIO & VIDEO OUTPUT.  This  connector supplies direct audio,  which
     can  be connected to a high quality sound system,  and a 'composite'
     video signal, which can be fed into a television 'monitor'.
  8. SERIAL PORT.  You can attach a printer or single disk drive directly
     to the Commodore 64 through this connector.
  9. CASSETTE INTERFACE.  A  DATASSETTE  recorder  can be attached to the
     computer  so  you  can  save  information entered for use at a later
     time.
 10. USER PORT.  Various interface cartridges can be attached to the user
     port, such as the VICMODEM, or RS 232 communication cartridge."
"In the context of the C64, What happens when a program encounters a RETURN statement, and what error occurs if no GOSUB was previously issued?","basic: RETURN

  This  statement  is  always  used  in conjunction with GOSUB.  When the
program  encounters  a  RETURN,  it  will go to the statement immediately
following the GOSUB command.  If no GOSUB was previously issued, a RETURN
WITHOUT GOSUB ERROR will occur."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function that returns the value of the cosine of an angle measured in radians?","basic: COS(X)  (cosine)

  Returns  the  value of the cosine of X, where X is an angle measured in
radians."
"In the context of the C64, What is the operator used for division in BASIC, and how would you divide 144 by 12?","basic: DIVISION

  Division uses the familiar '/'. For example, to divide 144 by 12, type:

  PRINT 144 / 12           <----- Hit <RETURN>
  12"
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to reset the Commodore 64 screen and text color to their default settings after running a color test?","C64 Rinitialize

<SHIFT> and <CLR/HOME>.  The screen should clear and the cursor
will  be  positioned  in  the  'home' spot (upper left-hand corner of the
screen).
  Now, simultaneously hold <C=> and the <7> key. This sets the text color
back to light blue.  There is one more step needed to get everything back
to normal. Hold <CTRL> and <0> (Zero not Oh!). This sets the display mode
back  to  normal.  If  you  remember,  we turned REVERSE type on with the
<CTRL><9> to create the color bars (the color bars were actually reversed
spaces).  If  we were in the normal text mode during the color test,  the
cursor would have moved, but just left blank spaces."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the Commodore key (<C=>) on a Commodore computer?","<C=> COMMODORE KEY key

  The Commodore key <C=> performs a number of functions. First, it allows
you to move between the text and graphic display modes.
  When  the computer is first turned on,  it is in the upper case/graphic
mode,  that  is,  everything  you  type is in upper case letters.  As was
mentioned, using the <SHIFT> key in this mode will display the graphic on
the right side of the keys.
  If you hold down the <C=> key and <SHIFT> key,  the display will change
to upper and lower case. Now, if you hold down the <C=> key and any other
key with a graphic symbol,  the graphic shown on the left side of the key
will be displayed.
  To get back into the upper case/graphic mode hold down the <C=> key and
<SHIFT> key again.
  The second function of the <C=> key is to  allow you access to a second
set  of  eight  text colors.  By holding down the <C=> key and any of the
number keys,  any text now typed will be in the alternate color available
from  the  key  you depressed.  Chapter 5 lists the text colors available
from each key.

"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax to multiply two numbers in a programming language?","basic: MULTIPLICATION

  If  you  wanted  to  multiply  12  times  12,  use  the asterisk (*) to
represent multiplication. You would type:

  PRINT 12 * 12            <----- Hit <RETURN>
  144"
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the BASIC command STR$(X)""?""","basic: STR$(X)

  This will return a string  which is identical to the PRINTed version of
X."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and function of the key that stands for ConTRoL?","<CTRL> key

  The  <CTRL>  key,  which  stands for ConTRoL, allows you to set colors,
and  perform  other  specialized  functions. You hold the <CTRL> key down
while  depressing  another  designated key to get a control function. You
had an opportunity to try the <CTRL> key  when you changed text colors to
create different color bars during the setup procedure."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the plus sign (+) in arithmetic operations?","basic: ADDITION

  The plus sign (+) signals addition: we instructed the computer to print
the result of 12 added to 12.  Other arithmetic operations take a similar
form to addition.  Remember to always hit <RETURN> after typing PRINT and
the calculation."
"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax to subtract 9 from 12 in a programming language?","basic: SUBTRACTION

  To subtract, use the conventional minus (-) sign. Type:

  PRINT 12 - 9             
  3"
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the <RUN/STOP> key in a BASIC program, and how can it be used in shifted mode?","<RUN/STOP> key

  Normally,  depressing the <RUN/STOP>  key  will stop the execution of a
BASIC program. It signals the computer to STOP doing something. Using the
<RUN/STOP> key in the shifted mode will allow you to automatically load a
program from tape."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the RIGHT$ command in BASIC?","basic: RIGHT$(X$,X)

  Returns the rightmost X characters in X$."
"In the context of the C64, What is one of the most important features of the Commodore 64?","Loading and Saving Programs

  One  of  the most important features of the Commodore 64 is the ability
to save and load programs to and from cassette tape or disk.
  This  capability allows you to save the programs you write for use at a
later time, or purchase prewritten programs to use with the Commodore 64.
  Make  sure  that  either  the  disk  drive or cassette unit is attached
properly."
"In the context of the C64, What is the procedure to save a program on tape in a computer?","SAVING PROGRAMS ON TAPE

  After entering a program, if you wish to save it on tape, type:

many ways to handle repetitive tasks."
"In the context of the C64, What does the <RESTORE> command do in a computer?","<RESTORE>  key

  <RESTORE>  operates as the name implies.  It stores the computer to the
normal  state  it was in before you changed things with a program or some
command. A lot more will be said on this in later chapters."
"In the context of the C64, What is the process and syntax for loading a program from a disk on a computer?","LOADING PROGRAMS FROM DISK

  Loading a program from disk follows the same format. Type:

  LOAD 'PROGRAM NAME',8

  The  8  is  the  code for the disk, so you're just letting the computer
know that you want the program loaded from the disk.
  After  you  hit  <RETURN>  the disk will start whirring and the display
shows:

  SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME
  LOADING
  READY.
  _

NOTE:
  When   you   load  a  new  program  into  the  computer's  memory,  any
instructions  that  were  in the computer previously will be erased. Make
sure  you  save  a  program  you're  working on before loading a new one.
Once a program has been loaded, you can RUN it, LIST, or make changes and
re-save the new version."
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to reset a Commodore 64 computer to its normal display, and how can you completely reset the machine as if it were turned off and on again?","C64 Reset
There is a simple way to
reset the machine  to the normal display.  First press the <RUN/STOP> key
and then press the <RESTORE> key.  <RUN/STOP> must always be held down in
order to use the <RESTORE> key function.
  This will clear the screen and return everything to normal. If there is
a  program  in  the computer,  it will be left untouched.  This is a good
sequence to remember, especially if you do a lot of programming.
  If  you  wish  to  reset  the machine as if it were turned off and then
switched on again, type,  SYS 64759  and press <RETURN>. Be careful using
this  command!  It  will  wipe  out  any  program  or information that is
currently in the computer."
"In the context of the C64, What is the command to save a program to disk, and what does the number 8 represent in the command?","SAVING PROGRAMS ON DISK

  Saving a program on disk is even simpler. Type:

  SAVE 'PROGRAM NAME',8

  The  8  is  the code for the disk,  so you're just letting the computer
know you want the program saved to disk.
  After you press  <RETURN>  the disk will start to turn and the computer
will respond with:

"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to load a game cartridge on a Commodore 64 computer?","CARTRIDGES: The Commodore 64 computer has a line of programs and games
on cartridge.  The programs offer a wide variety of business and personal
applications  and  the  games  are  just  like real arcade games  --  not
imitations. To load these games, first turn on your TV set. Next turn OFF
your  Commodore 64.  YOU MUST TURN OFF YOUR COMMODORE 64 BEFORE INSERTING
OR  REMOVING  CARTRIDGES  OR  YOU  MAY  DAMAGE  THE CARTRIDGE AND/OR YOUR
COMMODORE 64! Third insert the cartridge.  Now turn your Commodore 64 on.
Finally  type  the  appropriate START key as is listed on the instruction
sheet that comes with each game."
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to load a program from a cassette tape into a computer?","CASSETTES:  Use  your  DATASSETTE  recorder  and  the  ordinary  audio
cassettes  that  came as part of your prepackaged program.  Make sure the
tape is completely rewound to the beginning of the first side.  Then just
type  LOAD.  The  computer  will  answer with PRESS PLAY ON TAPE,  so you
respond  by  pressing play on your datassette machine.  At this point the
computer  screen  will go blank until the program is found.  The computer
will say  FOUND (PROGRAM NAME)  on the screen.  Now you press down on the
<C=> key.  This will actually load the program into the computer.  If you
want to stop the loading simply press <RUN/STOP> key."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the PRINT command in BASIC programming, and how can it be used for calculations and displaying results?","PRINT and Calculations

  Now  that  you've  gotten  through  a  couple  of  the  more  difficult
operations  you need  in order to keep the programs you like,  lets start
making some programs for you to save.
  Try typing the following exactly as shown:

  PRINT 'COMMODORE 64'     <----- Type this line and hit <RETURN>
  COMMODORE 64            <------ Computer typed

  READY.
  _

  If  you  make  a  typing  mistake,  use the <INST/DEL> key to erase the
character  immediately  to the left of the cursor. You can delete as many
characters as necessary.
  Let's  see  what  went on in the example above.  First,  you instructed
(commanded) the computer to PRINT whatever was inside the quote marks. By
hitting  <RETURN>  you  told  the computer to do  what you instructed and
COMMODORE 64 was printed on the screen.
  When you use the PRINT statement in this form,  whatever is enclosed in
quotes is printed exactly as you typed it.
  If the computer responded with:

  ?SYNTAX ERROR

ask yourself if you made a mistake in typing,  or forgot the quote marks.
The  computer  is  precise  and  expects  instructions  to  be given in a
specific form.
  But don't get worried; just remember to enter things as we present them
in the examples and you'll get along great with the Commodore 64.
  Remember, you can't hurt the computer by typing on it, and the best way
to learn BASIC is to try different things and see what happens.
  PRINT  is  one  of  the  most useful and powerful commands in the BASIC
language.  With  it,  you  can  display  just  about  anything  you wish,
including graphics and results of computations.
  For example,  try the following.  Clear the screen  by holding down the
<SHIFT> key  and  <CLR/HOME> key and type (be sure to use the '1' key for

  READY.
  _

  What you've discovered is  that the Commodore 64 is a calculator in its
basic form.  The result of '24' was calculated and printed automatically.
In  fact,  you can also perform  subtraction,  multiplication,  division,
exponentiation, and  advanced  math  functions such as calculating square
roots, etc. And you're not limited to a single calculation on a line, but
more on that later.
  Note  that in the above form,  PRINT behaved differently from the first
example.  In  this  case,  a value or result of a calculation is printed,
rather  than  the  exact message you entered because the quote marks were
omitted."
"In the context of the C64, What does the BASIC function ASC(X$) return?","basic: ASC(X$)

  This function will return the ASCII code of the first character of X$."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the <INST/DEL> key in a text editor?","<INST/DEL> key

  If  you  hit  the  <INST/DEL>  key,  the cursor will move back a space,
erasing  (DELeting)  the  previous  character you typed. If you're in the
middle of a line, the character to the left is deleted and the characters
to the right automatically move together to close up the space.
  A <SHIFT>ed <INST/DEL> allows you to INSerT information on a line.  For
example,  if you noticed a typing mistake  in the beginning of a line  --
perhaps you left out part of the name  -- you could use the <CRSR> key to
move back to the error  and then hit <INST/DEL>  to insert a space.  Then
just type in the missing later."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the CLR/HOME key on a computer keyboard?","<CLR/HOME> key

  <CLR/HOME>  positions  the cursor at the 'HOME' position of the screen,
which is the upper left-hand corner.  A shifted <CLR/HOME> will clear the
screen and place the cursor in the home position."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and functionality of the BASIC function USR(X)?","basic: USR(X)

  When  this  function  is used,  the program jumps to a machine language
program  whose  starting  point  is  contained  in memory locations.  The
parameter X is passed to the machine language program,  which will return
another  value  back  to  the  BASIC  program.  Refer to the Commodore 64
Programmer's Reference Manual  for  more  details  on  this  function and
machine language programming."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the SGN(X) function in basic programming?","basic: SGN(X)  (sign)

  This function returns the sign (positive, negative, or zero) of X.  The
result will be +1 if positive, 0 if zero, and -1 if negative."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of TAB(X) in a print statement in BASIC program?","basic: TAB(X)

  TAB is used in a PRINT statement; the next item to be PRINTed will
be in column X."
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to load a program from tape on a Commodore computer?","LOADING PROGRAMS FROM TAPE

  Loading  a program back from tape or disk is just as simple.  For tape,
rewind the tape back to the beginning and type:

  LOAD 'PROGRAM NAME'

  If  you  don't remember the program name,  just type LOAD and the first
program on the tape will be loaded into memory.
  After you press <RETURN> the computer will respond with:

  PRESS PLAY ON TAPE

  After  you  depress  the  play  key, the screen will blank, turning the
border color of the screen as the computer searches for the program.
  When the program is found, the screen will display:

  FOUND PROGRAM NAME

To  actually  load  the  program,  depress the <C=> key. To abandon the
loading  procedure,  hit  <RUN/STOP>.  If  you hit the Commodore key, the
screen  will  again  turn  the  border color while the program is loaded.
After  the  loading procedure is completed, the screen will return to the
normal state and the READY prompt will reappear."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the <CRSR> key on a keyboard?","<CRSR> key

  There are two keys marked <CRSR> (CuRSoR), one with up and down arrows,
the other with left and right arrows.  You can use these keys to move the
cursor up and down or left and right.  In the unshifted mode,  the <CRSR>
keys  will  let  you  move  the  cursor down and to the right.  Using the
<SHIFT> key and <CRSR> keys allows the cursor to be moved either up or to
the  left.  The  cursor keys have a special repeat feature that keeps the
cursor moving until you release the key."
"In the context of the C64, What features does the Commodore 64 offer to help with correcting typing mistakes and moving information on the screen?","EDITING key

  No  one  is  perfect,  and  the Commodore 64 takes that into account. A
number  of  editing  keys  let  you  correct  typing  mistakes  and  move
information around on the screen."
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to load a preprogrammed disk and run a software program?","DISK:  Using your disk drive,  carefully insert the preprogrammed disk
so  that  the label on the disk is facing up and is closest to you.  Look
for  a  little notch on the disk (it might be covered with a little piece
of tape). If  you're inserting the disk properly the notch will be on the
left side.  Once the disk is inside  close the protective gate by pushing
down on the lever.  Now type  LOAD 'PROGRAM NAME',8  and hit the <RETURN>
key. The disk will make noise and your screen will say:

  SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME

"In the context of the C64, What are the definitions and behaviors of the SIN(X), SQR(X), and TAN(X) functions?","basic: SIN(X)  (sine)

  SIN(X) is the trigonometric sine function.  The result will be the sine
of X, where X is an angle in radians.

SQR(X)  (square root)

  This  function will return the square root of X,  where X is a positive
number or 0. If X is negative, an ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR results.

TAN(X)  (tangent)

  The result will be the tangent of X, where X is an angle in radians."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the LEFT$ command in BASIC?","basic: LEFT$(X$,X)

numbers if the number of unused bytes is over 32K."
"In the context of the C64, What is the procedure to adjust the color settings on a Commodore 64 computer using the keyboard controls?","C64 Color Adjustment

  There  is  a simple way to get a pattern of colors on the TV so you can
easily  adjust  the  set.  Even  though  you may not be familiar with the
operation  of the computer right now,  just follow along,  and you'll see
how easy it is to use the Commodore 64.
  First,  look on the left side of the keyboard and locate the key marked
<CTRL>.  This  stands for ConTRoL and is used,  in conjunction with other
keys, to instruct the computer to do a specific task.

  To  use  a  control  function,  you  hold  down  the  <CTRL>  key while
depressing a second key.
  Try this:  hold the <CTRL> key  while also depressing the <9> key. Then
release both keys. Nothing obvious should have happened, but if you touch
any  key  now,  the  screen  will show the character displayed in reverse
type, rather than normal type -- like the opening message or anything you
typed earlier.
  Hold down the <SPACE BAR>. What happens? If you did the above procedure
correctly,  you  should  see  a light blue bar move across the screen and
then move down to the next line as long as the <SPACE BAR> is depressed.

     **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****
  64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE

  READY.

  Now,  hold <CTRL>  while depressing any of the other number keys.  Each
of  them  has a color  marked on the front.  Anything displayed from this
point will be in that color. For example, hold <CTRL> and the <8> key and
release both. Now hold the <SPACE BAR>.
  Watch the display.  The bar is now in yellow!  In a like manner you can
change  the  bar  to  any  of  the colors indicated on the number keys by
holding <CTRL> and the appropriate key.
  Change the bar to a few more different colors and then adjust the color
and  tint  controls  on  your  TV  so  the display matches the colors you
selected.
  The display should appear something like this:

     **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****
  64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE

  READY.
  _________________________     <------ <3> Red bar
  _______ ____________ ____     <------ <3>,<6>,<7> Red, Green, Blue bars
  __________ ______________     <------ <7>,<8> Blue, Yellow bars
  ____________                  <------ <8> Yellow bar

  At  this  point  everything is properly adjusted and working correctly.
The following chapters will introduce you to the BASIC language. However,
you can  immediately start using some of the many prewritten applications
and  games available for the Commodore 64  without knowing anything about
computer programming.
  Each  of  these packages contains detailed information about how to use
the  program.  It is suggested,  though,  that you read through the first
few  chapters  of  this  manual  to  become  more familiar with the basic
operation of your new system."
"In the context of the C64, What is the operation represented by the '^' symbol in programming, and how does it differ from multiplication?","basic: EXPONENTIATION

  In  a  like fashion,  you can easily raise a number to a power (this is
the same as multiplying a number by itself  a specified number of times).
The '^' (up arrow) signifies exponentiation.

  PRINT 12 ^ 5
  248832

  This is the same as typing:

  PRINT 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12
  248832"
"In the context of the C64, What is a shortcut way to replace the BASIC command PRINT"" in a calculation?""","BASIC  has  number  of  shortcut ways of doing things.  One such way is
abbreviating BASIC commands (or keywords).  A '?' can be used in place of
PRINT,  for example.  As we go on you'll be presented with many commands;
Appendix D shows the abbreviations for each and what will be displayed on
the screen when you type the abbreviated form.

many calculations
may be performed on the same line, and they can be of mixed types.
  You could calculate this problem:

  ? 3 + 5 - 7 + 2          (The '?' replaces the word PRINT)

"In the context of the C64, What is the first thing you should do after setting up your Commodore 64?","C64 Keyboard

  Now that you've got everything set up and adjusted,  please  take a few
moments  to  familiarize  yourself  with  the keyboard which is your most
important means of communication with the Commodore 64.
  You  will  find  the keyboard similar to a standard typewriter keyboard
found  in  most  areas.  There  are,  however, a number of new keys which
control specialized functions. What follows is a brief description of the
various  keys  and how they function.  The detailed operation of each key
will be covered in later sections."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and behavior of the VAL function in Basic programming?","basic: VAL(X$)

  This function converts X$ into a number, and is essentially the inverse
operation  from STR$.  The string is examined from the leftmost character
to  the  right,  for  as  many  characters  as are in recognizable number
format.

  10 X = VAL('123.456')             X = 123.456
  10 X = VAL('12A13B')              X = 12
  10 X = VAL('RIU017')              X = 0
  10 X = VAL('-1.23.45.67')         X = -1.23"
"In the context of the C64, What is the function in Visual Basic that returns a string character whose ASCII code is a specified value?","basic: CHR$(X)

  This is the opposite of ASC, and returns a string character whose ASCII
code is X."
"In the context of the C64, What does the BASIC function POS(X) return?","basic: POS(X)

  This function returns the number of the column (0-39) at which the next
PRINT statement will begin on the screen. X may have any value and is not
used."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function in BASIC that returns the number of characters in a string, including spaces and symbols?","basic: LEN(X$)

  Returned will be the number of characters  (including  spaces and other
symbols) in the string X$."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the key on a keyboard that allows you to switch between uppercase and lowercase characters, as well as access graphic characters and special functions?","<SHIFT> key

  The <SHIFT> key works like that on a standard typewriter. Many keys are
capable of displaying two letters or symbols  and two graphic characters.
In  the  'upper/lower case' mode the <SHIFT> key gives you standard upper
case  characters.  In the 'upper case/graphic' mode  the <SHIFT> key will
display the graphic character on the right hand side of the front part of
the key.
  In the case of special YELLOW function keys,  the <SHIFT> key will give
you the function marked on the front of the key."
"In the context of the C64, What does the <RETURN> key do when you press it after typing information?","<RETURN> key

  The <RETURN> key signals the computer  to look at the information  that
you typed and enters that information into memory."
"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax and purpose of the MID$ function in BASIC programming?","basic: MID$(X$,S,X)

  This will return a string containing X characters starting from the Sth
character in X$."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the basic statement SPC(X)"" in a PRINT statement?""","basic: SPC(X)

  This is used in a PRINT statement to skip X spaces forward."
"In the context of the C64, What is the concept in Commodore 64 programming that allows you to directly manipulate specific memory locations to change various aspects of the computer's behavior, such as screen colors and object definitions?","basic:  PEEKs and POKEs

  Just  as  variables  could be thought of as a representation of 'boxes'
within the machine where you placed your information,  you can also think
of  some  specially  defined  'boxes'  within the computer that represent
specific memory locations.

  The  Commodore 64  looks  at  these  memory  locations  to see what the
screen's background and border color should be, what characters are to be
displayed on the screen -- and where -- and a host of other tasks.
  By  placing,  'POKEing',  a  different  value  into  the  proper memory
location,  we can change colors, define and move objects, and even create
music.

  Above  we  showed just four locations,  two of which control the screen
and background colors. Try typing this:

  POKE 53281,7 <RETURN>

  The  background  color  of  the screen will change to yellow because we
placed the value '7' --  for yellow --  in the location that controls the
background color of the screen."
"In the context of the C64, What are the differences and uses of the GOSUB and GOTO statements in programming?","basic: GOSUB

  This statement is similar to GOTO,  except the computer remembers which
program line it last executed before the GOSUB. When a line with a RETURN
statement  is  encountered,  the  program  jumps  back  to  the statement
immediately following the GOSUB.  This is useful if there is a routine in
your program that occurs in several parts of the program.
Instead of typing the routine over and over, execute GOSUBs each time the
routine is needed.

  20 GOSUB 800

GOTO or GO TO

  When a statement with the GOTO command is reached,  the next line to be
executed will be the one with the line number following the word GOTO."
"In the context of the C64, What is the function of the NEW command in BASIC programming?","basic: NEW

  This  command  erases  the  entire  program in memory,  and also clears
out  any  variables  that  may  have  been  used.  Unless the program was
SAVEd, it is lost. BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THIS COMMAND.
  The NEW command can also be used as a BASIC program statement. When the
program reaches this line,  the program is erased.  This is useful if you
want to leave everything neat when the program is done."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the LOAD command in Commodore 64?","basic: LOAD

  This  command  is  used  to  transfer  a program from tape or disk into
memory  so  the  program  can  be  used.  If  you  just type LOAD and hit
RETURN,  the  first  program found on the cassette unit will be placed in
memory.  The  command  may  be followed by a program name enclosed within
quotes.  The  name  may  then  be  followed  by  a  comma and a number or
numeric  variable,  which  acts  as a device number to indicate where the
program is coming from.

  If  no  device  number  is  given,  the Commodore 64 assumes device #1,
which  is  the  cassette  unit.  The  other device commonly used with the
LOAD command is the disk device, which is device #8.

  LOAD              Reads in the next program on tape
  LOAD 'HELLO'      Searches tape for program called HELLO,
                    and loads program, if found
  LOAD A$           Looks for program whose name is in the variable A$
  LOAD 'HELLO',8    Looks for program called HELLO on the disk drive
  LOAD '*',8        Looks for first program on disk"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the GET# statement in BASIC programming?","basic: GET#

  The GET# statement is used with a previously OPENed device or file,  to
input one character at a time from that device or file.

  GET #1,A$

This would input one character from a data file."
"In the context of the C64, What are the keyboard shortcuts and corresponding colors for the display?","KEYBOARD    COLOR      DISPLAY         KEYBOARD    COLOR      DISPLAY

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the SYS command in a programming language?","basic: SYS

  SYS  is  followed  by  a  decimal  number or numeric value in the range
0-65535.  The  program  will  then  begin  executing the machine language
program  starting  at  that  memory  location. This is similar to the USR
function, but does not allow parameter passing."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the RUN command in a programming language?","basic: RUN

  This  command  causes  execution  of  a  program,  once  the program is
loaded  into  memory.  If  there  is  no  line  number following RUN, the
computer  will  start  with  the  lowest line number. If a line number is
designated, the program will start executing from the specified line.

  RUN               Starts program at lowest line number
  RUN 100           Starts execution at line 100
  RUN X             UNDEFINED STATEMENT ERROR. You must always specify an
                    actual line number, not a variable representation"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the IF ... THEN statement in BASIC programming?","basic: IF ... THEN

  IF ... THEN lets the computer analyze a situation and take two possible
courses of action,  depending on the outcome.  If the expression is true,
the  statement  following  THEN  is  executed.  This  may  be  any  BASIC
statement.
  If the expression is false, the program goes directly to the next line.
  The expression being evaluated may be a variable or formula,  in  which
case it is considered true if nonzero,  and false if zero.  In most cases,
there  is an expression involving relational operators  (=, <, >, <=, >=,
<>, AND, OR, NOT).

  10 IF X > 10 THEN END"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the INPUT statement in a programming language?","basic: INPUT

  The  INPUT  statement  allows  the  program  to get data from the user,
assigning  that  data  to  a  variable.  The  program  will stop, print a
question  mark  (?)  on  the screen, and wait for the user to type in the
answer and hit RETURN.
  INPUT  is  followed  by  a  variable name, or a list of variable names,
separated by commas.  A message may be placed within quote marks,  before
the  list of variable names to be INPUT.  If more than one variable is to
be INPUT, they must be separated by commas when typed.

  10 INPUT 'PLEASE ENTER YOUR FIRST NAME';A$
  20 PRINT 'ENTER YOUR CODE NUMBER';: INPUT B"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the SAVE command in Commodore 64 BASIC?","basic: SAVE

  This  command  will  store  the program currently in memory on cassette
or  disk.  If  you  just  type SAVE and RETURN, the program will be SAVEd
on  cassette.  The  computer  has no way of knowing if there is a program
already  on  that  tape, so be careful with your tapes or you may erase a
valuable program.
  If you type SAVE followed by a name in quotes or a string variable, the
computer  will  give  the  program  that  name,  so it can be more easily
located  and retrieved in the future.  The name may also be followed by a
device number.
  After  the  device  number,  there  can be a comma and a second number,
either  0  or  1. If the second number is 1, the Commodore 64 will put an
END-OF-TAPE  marker  after  your  program.  This signals the computer not
to  look  any  further on the tape if you were to give an additional LOAD
command.  If  you  try  to  LOAD  a program and the computer finds one of
these markers, you will get a FILE NOT FOUND ERROR.

  SAVE              Stores program to tape without name
  SAVE 'HELLO'      Stores on tape with name HELLO
  SAVE A$           Stores on tape with name A$

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and behavior of the STOP statement in a program?","basic: STOP

  This statement will halt program execution.  The message,  BREAK IN xxx
will  be  displayed,  where  xxx is the line number containing STOP.  The
program may be restarted by using the CONT command. STOP is normally used
in debugging a program."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the BASIC command PEEK(X)?","basic: PEEK(X)

  Used  to  find  out  contents  of  memory  location  X,  in  the  range
0-65535,  giving  a  result from 0-255. PEEK is often used in conjunction

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and usage of the CMD command in BASIC programming?","basic: CMD

  CMD sends the output which normally would go to the screen (i.e., PRINT

instead.  This could be a printer,  or a data file on tape or disk.  This
device or file must be OPENed first.  The CMD command must be followed by
a number or numeric variable referring to the file.

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the GET statement in BASIC programming?","basic: GET

  The  GET  statement  allows  you  to  get  data from the keyboard,  one
character at a time. When GET is executed, the character that is typed is
assigned to the variable.  If no character is typed,  then a null (empty)
character is assigned.
  GET  is  followed by a variable name,  usually a string variable.  If a
numeric  variable  was  used and a nonnumeric key depressed,  the program
would halt with an error message.  The GET statement may be placed into a
loop,  checking for  any result.  This loop will continue  until a key is
hit.

  10 GET A$: IF  A$ = ''  THEN 10"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the flashing square under READY on the screen?","CURSOR

  The  flashing  square  under  READY  is called the cursor and indicates
where what you type on the keyboard  will be displayed on the screen.  As
you  type,  the cursor will move ahead one space,  as the original cursor
position  is  replaced  with  the character you typed.  Try typing on the
keyboard and watch as characters you type are displayed on the TV screen."
"In the context of the C64, What advice does Commodore offer to users who may encounter difficulties with their COMMODORE 64 computer?","TIP:  The  COMMODORE 64  was designed  to be used by everyone.  But we at
Commodore  recognize  that  computer  users may,  occasionally,  run into
difficulties.  To  help  answer  your  questions  and  give  you some fun
programming  ideas,  Commodore  has  created several publications to help
you.  You might also find that it's a good idea to join a Commodore Users
Club  to  help  you  meet some other COMMODORE 64 owners who can help you
gain knowledge and experience."
"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax and functionality of the FOR loop statement in a programming language?","basic: FOR ... TO ... STEP

  This statement works with the NEXT statement to repeat a section of the
program a set number of times. The format is:

  FOR (Var. Name)=(Start of Count) TO (End of Count) STEP (Count By)

  The  loop  variable  will  be  added  to  or subtracted from during the
program.  Without any STEP specified,  STEP is assumed to be 1. The start
count and end count are the limits to the value of the loop variable.

  10 FOR L = 1 to 10 STEP .1
  20 PRINT L
  30 NEXT L

  The end of the loop value may be followed by the word STEP  and another
number or variable.  In this case, the value following STEP is added each
time instead of 1. This allows you to count backwards, or by fractions."
"In the context of the C64, What is the effect of the CLR command in BASIC?","basic: CLR

  This command will erase any variables in memory, but leaves the program
itself intact.  This command is automatically executed when a RUN command
is given."
"In the context of the C64, What is the syntax and behavior of the RND function in a programming language, including how to generate a random number between a specific range and how to reseed the random number generator?","basic: RND(X)  (random number)

  RND(X)  returns  a  random  number  in  the range 0-1. The first random
number  should  be  generated by the formula RND(-TI) to start things off
differently  every  time.  After  this,  X  should be a 1 or any positive
number.  If  X  is zero, the result will be the same random number as the
last one.
  A  negative  value  for  X  will  reseed  the generator. The use of the
same  negative  number  for  X  will  result  in  the  same  sequence  of
'random' numbers.
  The formula for generating a number between X and Y is:

  N = RND(1) * (Y-X) + X

where,
  Y is the upper limit,
  X is the lower range of numbers desired."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the DIM statement in programming and how does it relate to arrays?","basic: DIM

  When you use more than 11 elements of an array,  you must execute a DIM
statement for the array.  Keep in mind that the whole array takes up room
in  memory,  so  don't  create  an  array  much  larger than you'll need.
To  figure  the number of variables created with DIM,  multiply the total
number of elements in each dimension of the array.

  10 DIM A$(40), B7(15), CC%(4,4,4)
             ^       ^         ^
             |       |         |

  You  can  dimension more than one array in a DIM statement. However, be
careful not to dimension an array more than once."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and syntax of the VERIFY command in Commodore 64?","basic: VERIFY

  This  command  causes  the  computer  to  check  the program on disk or
tape  against  the  one  in  memory.  This  is  proof that the program is
actually SAVEd,  in case the tape or disk is bad, or something went wrong
during  the  SAVE.  VERIFY  without anything after the command causes the
Commodore  64  to  check  the  next  program on tape, regardless of name,
against the program in memory.
  VERIFY  followed by a program name,  or a string variable,  will search
for that program and then check. Device numbers can also be included with
the verify command.

  VERIFY            Checks the next program on tape
  VERIFY 'HELLO'    Searches for HELLO, checks against memory
  VERIFY 'HELLO',8  Searches for HELLO on disk, then checks"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the CONT command in a program?","basic: CONT (Continue)

  This command is used to restart the execution of a  program  which  has
been stopped by either using the <STOP> key, a STOP statement,  or an END
statement within the program. The program will restart at the exact place
from where it left off.
  CONT will not work if you have changed or added lines  to  the  program
(or even just moved the cursor),  or if the  program  halted  due  to  an
error, or if you caused an error before trying to restart the program. In
these cases you will get a CAN'T CONTINUE ERROR."
"In the context of the C64, What are the different ways to use the LIST command in BASIC programming?","basic: LIST

  The  LIST  command  allows  you  to look at lines of a BASIC program in

certain line numbers.

  LIST              Shows entire program
  LIST 10-          Shows only from line 10 until end
  LIST 10           Shows only line 10

  When a program encounters an END statement, the program halts, as if it
ran out of lines. You may use CONT to restart the program."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the OPEN statement in BASIC?","OUTPUT TO OTHER DEVICES

    It is often necessary to send output to devices other than the screen,
  like a cassette deck, printer, disk drive, or modem. The OPEN statement
  in BASIC creates a 'channel' to talk to one of these devices. Once the
  channel is OPEN, the PRINT# statement will send characters to that
  device.

  EXAMPLE of OPEN and PRINT# Statements:

    100 OPEN 4,4: PRINT# 4, 'WRITING ON PRINTER'
    110 OPEN 3,8,3,'0:DISK-FILE,S,W':PRINT#3,'SEND TO DISK'
    120 OPEN 1,1,1,'TAPE-FILE': PRINT#1,'WRITE ON TAPE'
    130 OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(10):PRINT#2,'SEND TO MODEM'
    The OPEN statement is somewhat different for each device. The pa-
  rameters in the OPEN statement are shown in the table below for each
  device."
"In the context of the C64, How can I output data to the RS-232 on the Commodore 64?","SENDING DATA TO AN RS-232 CHANNEL

    When sending data, the output buffer can hold 255 characters before a
  full buffer hold-off occurs. The system will wait in the CHROUT routine
  until transmission is allowed or the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys are
  used to recover the system through a WARM START.

  KERNAL ENTRIES:

    CHKOUT ($FFC9)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.
    CHROUT ($FFD2)-See Memory Map for more information on entry conditions.
 
 
  | IMPORTANT NOTES: There is no carriage-return delay built into the     |
  | output channel. This means that a normal RS-232 printer cannot        |
  | correctly print, unless some form of hold-off (asking the Commodore 64|
  | to wait) or internal buffering is implemented by the printer. The     |
  | hold-off can easily be implemented in your program. If a CTS (x-line) |
  | handshake is implemented, the Commodore 64 buffer will fill, and then |
  | hold-off more output until transmission is allowed by the RS-232      |
  | device. X-line handshaking is a handshake routine that uses multi-    |
  | lines for receiving and transmitting data.                            |
  |   The routine CHKOUT handles the x-line handshake, which follows the  |

    This register appears at memory locations 0 (for the DATA DIRECTION
  REGISTER) and 1 (for the actual PORT). It is an 8-bit input/output port.
  On the Commodore 64 this register is used for memory management, to
  allow the chip to control more than 64K of RAM and ROM memory.
    The details of these registers are not given here. They are explained
  as the principles needed to explain them are explained."
"In the context of the C64, What types of filtering are available on the SID chip?","FILTERING

    The harmonic content of a waveform can be changed by using a filter.
  The SID chip is equipped with three types of filtering. They can be used
  separately or in combination with one another. Let's go back to the
  sample program you've been using to play with a simple example that uses
  a filter. There are several filter controls to set.
    You add line 15 in the program to set the cutoff frequency of the
  filter. The cutoff frequency is the reference point for the filter. You
  SET the high and low frequency cutoff points in registers 21 and 22. To
  turn ON the filter for voice 1, POKE register 23.
    Next change line 30 to show that a high-pass filter will be used (see
  the SID register map).


    The SID chip also has a low-pass filter. As its name implies, this
  filter will pass the frequencies below cutoff and attenuate those above.


    Finally, the chip is equipped with a bandpass filter, which passes a
  narrow band of frequencies around the cutoff, and attenuates all others.


    The high- and low-pass filters can be combined to form a notch reject
  filter which passes frequencies away from the cutoff while attenuating
  at the cutoff frequency.



    Register 24 determines which type filter you want to use. This is in
  addition to register 24's function as the overall volume control. Bit 6
  controls the high-pass filter (0 = off, 1 = on), bit 5 is the bandpass
  filter, and bit 4 is the low-pass filter. The low 3 bits of the cutoff
  frequency are determined by register 21 (Lcf) (Lcf = 0 through 7). While
  the 8 bits of the high cutoff frequency are determined by register 22
  (Hcf) (Hcf = 0 through 255).
    Through careful use of filtering, you can change the harmonic structure
  of any waveform to get just the sound you want. In addition, changing the
  filtering of a sound as it goes through the ADSR phases of its life can
  produce interesting effects."

    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: LISTEN, [SECOND]
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 5
    Registers affected: None

    Description: This routine is used to send information to devices on the
  serial bus. A call to this routine will put a data byte onto the serial
  bus using full serial handshaking. Before this routine is called, the
  LISTEN KERNAL routine must be used to command a device on the serial bus
  to get ready to receive data. (If a device needs a secondary address, it
  must also be sent by using the SECOND KERNAL routine.) The accumulator is
  loaded with a byte to handshake as data on the serial bus. A device must
  be listening or the status word will return a timeout. This routine
  always buffers one character. (The routine holds the previous character
  to be sent back.) So when a call to the KERNAL UNLSN routine is made to
  end the data transmission, the buffered character is sent with an End Or
  Identify (EOI) set. Then the UNLSN command is sent to the device.
  How to Use:

    0) Use the LISTEN KERNAL routine (and the SECOND routine if needed).
    1) Load the accumulator with a byte of data.
    2) Call this routine to send the data byte.

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the BANK SELECT bits in the 6526 COMPLEX INTERFACE ADAPTER CHIP #2 (CIA #2) in the Commodore 64?","VIDEO BANK SELECTION
 OR VBLANK

    The VIC-II chip can access ('see') 16K of memory at a time. Since there
  is 64K of memory in the Commodore 64, you want to be able to have the
  VIC-II chip see all of it. There is a way. There are 4 possible BANKS
  (or sections) of 16K of memory. All that is needed is some means of
  controlling which 16K bank the VIC-II chip looks at. In that way, the
  chip can 'see' the entire 64K of memory. The BANK SELECT bits that allow
  you access to all the different sections of memory are located in the
  6526 COMPLEX INTERFACE ADAPTER CHIP #2 (CIA #2). The POKE and PEEK BASIC
  statements (or their machine language versions) are used to select a
  bank, by controlling bits 0 and 1 of PORT A of CIA#2 (location 56576 (or
  $DD00 HEX)). These 2 bits must be set to outputs by setting bits 0 and 1
  of location 56578 ($DD02,HEX) to change banks. The following example
  shows this:

    POKE 56578,PEEK(56578)OR 3: REM MAKE SURE BITS 0 AND 1 ARE OUTPUTS
    POKE 56576,(PEEK(56576)AND 252)OR A: REM CHANGE BANKS



  This 16K bank concept is part of everything that the VIC-II chip does.
  You should always be aware of which bank the VIC-II chip is pointing at,
  since this will affect where character data patterns come from, where the
  screen is, where sprites come from, etc. When you turn on the power of
  your Commodore 64, bits 0 and 1 of location 56576 are automatically set
  to BANK 0 ($0000-$3FFF) for all display information.

  
  NOTE: The Commodore 64 character set is not available to the VIC-II 
  chip in BANKS 1 and 3. (See character memory section.)"
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the interrupt status register in the Commodore 64?","INTERRUPT STATUS REGISTER

    The interrupt status register shows the current status of any interrupt
  source. The current status of bit 2 of the interrupt register will be a 1
  when two sprites hit each other. The same is true, in a corresponding 1
  to 1 relationship, for bits 0-3 listed in the chart below. Bit 7 is also
  set with a 1, whenever an interrupt occurs.
    The interrupt status register is located at 53273 ($D019) and is as
  follows:

    LATCH  BIT#             DESCRIPTION

    IRST    0   Set when current raster count = stored raster count
    IMDC    1   Set by SPRITE-DATA collision (1st one only, until reset)
    IMMC    2   Set by SPRITE-SPRITE collision (1st one only, until reset)
     ILP    3   Set by negative transition of light pen (1 per frame)
     IRQ    7   Set by latch set and enabled
 
    Once an interrupt bit has been set, it's 'latched' in and must be
  cleared by writing a 1 to that bit in the interrupt register when you're
  ready to handle it. This allows selective interrupt handling, without
  having to store the other interrupt bits."
"In the context of the C64, What are the three registers used to move a sprite around the screen on a Commodore 64?","SPRITE POSITIONING

    Once you've made a sprite you want to be able to move it around the
  screen. To do this, your Commodore 64 uses three positioning registers:

    1) SPRITE X POSITION REGISTER
    2) SPRITE Y POSITION REGISTER
    3) MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT X POSITION REGISTER

    Each sprite has an X position register, a Y position register, and a
  bit in the X most significant bit register. This lets you position your
  sprites very accurately. You can place your sprite in 512 possible X
  positions and 256 possible Y positions.
    The X and Y position registers work together, in pairs, as a team. The
  locations of the X and Y registers appear in the memory map as follows:
  First is the X register for sprite 0, then the Y register for sprite 0.
  Next comes the X register for sprite 1, the Y register for sprite 1, and
  so on. After all 16 X and Y registers comes the most significant bit in
  the X position (X MSB) located in its own register."
"In the context of the C64, What is the correct POKE statement to move the screen to a new location?","The location of screen memory can be changed easily by a POKE to
  control register 53272 ($D018 HEX). However, this register is also used
  to control which character set is used, so be careful to avoid disturbing
  that part of the control register. The UPPER 4 bits control the location
  of screen memory. To move the screen, the following statement should be
  used:
  POKE53272,(PEEK(53272)AND15)OR A
  Where 'A' has one of the following values:

You must also tell the KERNAL'S screen editor where the screen is as
follows: POKE 648, page (where page = address/256, e.g., 1024/256= 4,
so POKE 648,4)."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER in the VIC-II chip?","The INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER is located at 53274 ($D01A). It has the
  same format as the interrupt status register. Unless the corresponding
  bit in the interrupt enable register is set to a 1, no interrupt from
  that source will take place. The interrupt status register can still be
  polled for information, but no interrupts will be generated.
    To enable an interrupt request the corresponding interrupt enable bit
  (as shown in the chart above) must be set to a 1.
    This powerful interrupt structure lets you use split screen modes. For
  instance you can have half of the screen bit mapped, half text, more than
  8 sprites at a time, etc. The secret is to use interrupts properly. For
  example, if you want the top half of the screen to be bit mapped and the
  bottom to be text, just set the raster compare register (as explained
  previously) for halfway down the screen. When the interrupt occurs, tell
  the VIC-II chip to get characters from ROM, then set the raster compare
  register to interrupt at the top of the screen. When the interrupt occurs
  at the top of the screen, tell the VIC-II chip to get characters from RAM
  (bit map mode).
  You can also display more than 8 sprites in the same way. Unfortunately BASIC isn't fast enough to do this very well. So if you want to start using display interrupts, you should work in machine language."

"In the context of the C64, How can I get data from an RS-232 channel on a Commodore 64?","GETTING DATA FROM AN RS-232 CHANNEL

    When getting data from an RS-232 channel, the Commodore 64 receiver
  buffer will hold up to 255 characters before the buffer overflows. This
  is indicated in the RS-232 status word (ST in BASIC, or RSSTAT in machine
  language). If an overflow occurs, then all characters received during a
  full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost. Obviously, it pays
  to keep the buffer as clear as possible.
    If you wish to receive RS-232 data at high speeds (BASIC can only go so
  fast, especially considering garbage collects. This can cause the re-
  ceiver buffer to overflow), you will have to use machine language
  routines to handle this type of data burst.

"In the context of the C64, How does the print function works?","OUTPUT TO THE TV

    The simplest form of output in BASIC is the PRINT statement. PRINT uses
  the TV screen as the output device, and your eyes are the input device
  because they use the information on the screen.
    When PRINTing on the screen, your main objective is to format the
  information on the screen so it's easy to read. You should try to think
  like a graphic artist, using colors, placement of letters, capital and
  lower case letters, as well as graphics to best communicate the
  information. Remember, no matter how smart your program, you want to be
  able to understand what the results mean to you.
    The PRINT statement uses certain character codes as 'commands' to the
  cursor. The <CRSR> key doesn't actually display anything, it just makes
  the cursor change position. Other commands change colors, clear the
  screen, and insert or delete spaces. The <RETURN> key has a character
  code number (CHR$) of 13. A complete table of these codes is contained in
  Appendix C.
    There are two functions in the BASIC language that work with the PRINT
  statement. TAB positions the,cursor on the given position from the left
  edge of the screen, SPC moves the cursor right a given number of spaces
  from the current position.
    Punctuation marks in the PRINT statement serve to separate and format
  information. The semicolon (;) separates 2 items without any spaces in
  between. If it is the last thing on a line, the cursor remains after the
  last thing PRINTed instead of going down to the next line. It suppresses
  (replaces) the RETURN character that is normally PRINTed at the end of
  the line.
    The comma (,) separates items into columns. The Commodore 64 has 4
  columns of 10 characters each on the screen. When the computer PRINTs a
  comma, it moves the cursor right to the start of the next column. If it
  is past the last column of the line, it moves the cursor down to the next
  line. Like the semicolon, if it is the last item on a line the RETURN is
  suppressed.
    The quote marks ('') separate literal text from variables. The first
  quote mark on the line starts the literal area, and the next quote mark
  ends it. By the way, you don't have to have a final quote mark at the
  end of the line.
    The RETURN code (CHR$ code of 13) makes the cursor go to the next
  logical line on the screen. This is not always the very next line. When
  you type past the end of a line, that line is linked to the next line.
  The computer knows that both lines are really one long line. The links
  are held in the line link table (see the memory map for how this is set
  up).
    A logical line can be 1 or 2 screen lines long, depending on what was
  typed or PRINTed.  The logical line the cursor is on determines where the
  <RETURN> key sends it. The logical line at the top of the screen
  determines if the screen scrolls 1 or 2 lines at a time. There are other
  ways to use the TV as an output device. The chapter on graphics describes
  the commands to create objects that move across the screen. The VIC chip
  section tells how the screen and border colors and sizes are changed. And
  the sound chapter tells how the TV speaker creates music and special
  effects."
"In the context of the C64, What is the Commodore 64's built-in interface for connecting to devices?","RS-232 INTERFACE DESCRIPTION

  GENERAL OUTLINE

    The Commodore 64 has a built-in RS-232 interface for connection to any
  RS-232 modem, printer, or other device. To connect a device to the
  Commodore 64, all you need is a cable and a little bit of programming.
    RS-232 on the Commodore 64 is set-up in the standard RS-232 format, but
  the voltages are TTL levels (0 to 5V) rather than the normal RS-232 -12
  to 12 volt range. The cable between the Commodore 64 and the RS-232
  device should take care of the necessary voltage conversions. The
  Commodore RS-232 interface cartridge handles this properly.
    The RS-232 interface software can be accessed from BASIC or from the
  KERNAL for machine language programming.
    RS-232 on the BASIC level uses the normal BASIC commands: OPEN, CLOSE,
  CMD, INPUT#, GET#, PRINT#, and the reserved variable ST. INPUT# and GET#
  fetch data from the receiving buffer, while PRINT# and CMD place data
  into the transmitting buffer. The use of these commands (and examples)
  will be described in more detail later in this chapter.
    The RS-232 KERNAL byte and bit level handlers run under the control of
  the 6526 CIA #2 device timers and interrupts. The 6526 chip generates

  NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) requests for RS-232 processing. This allows
  background RS-232 processing to take place during BASIC and machine
  language programs. There are built-in hold-offs in the KERNAL, cassette,
  and serial bus routines to prevent the disruption of data storage or
  transmission by the NMIs that are generated by the RS-232 routines.
  During cassette or serial bus activities, data can NOT be received from
  RS-232 devices. But because these hold-offs are only local (assuming
  you're careful about your programming) no interference should result.
    There are two buffers in the Commodore 64 RS-232 interface to help
  prevent the loss of data when transmitting or receiving RS-232 informa-
  tion.
    The Commodore 64 RS-232 KERNAL buffers consist of two first-in/first-
  out (FIFO) buffers, each 256 bytes long, at the top of memory. The
  OPENing of an RS-232 channel automatically allocates 512 bytes of memory
  for these buffers. If there is not enough free space beyond the end of
  your BASIC program no error message will be printed, and the end of your
  program will be destroyed. SO BE CAREFUL!
    These buffers are automatically removed by using the CLOSE command."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and functionality of the MACHINE LANGUAGE MONITOR (64MON) program?","MACHINE LANGUAGE MONITOR (64MON):

  drawback to this method is that it generally requires the BASIC program
  to load the machine language routine from tape or disk when it is
  started. (For more details on 64MON see the machine language section.)

"In the context of the C64, What is the harmonic structure of a triangular wave, and how does it relate to the fundamental frequency and the harmonic number?","UNDERSTANDING WAVEFORMS

    When a note is played, it consists of a sine wave oscillating at the
  fundamental frequency and the harmonics of that wave.
    The fundamental frequency defines the overall pitch of the note.
  Harmonics are sine waves having frequencies which are integer multiples
  of the fundamental frequency. A sound wave is the fundamental frequency
  and all of the harmonics it takes to make up that sound.

    In musical theory let's say that the fundamental frequency is harmonic
  number 1. The second harmonic has a frequency twice the fundamental
  frequency, the third harmonic is three times the fundamental frequency,
  and so on. The amounts of each harmonic present in a note give it its
  timbre.
    An acoustic instrument, like a guitar or a violin, has a very compli-
  cated harmonic structure. In fact, the harmonic structure may vary as a
   single note is played. You have already played with the waveforms
  available in your Commodore music synthesizer. Now let's talk about how
  the harmonics work with the triangular, sawtooth, and rectangular waves.
    A triangular wave contains only odd harmonics. The amount of each
  harmonic present is proportional to the reciprocal of the square of the
  harmonic number. In other words harmonic number 3 is 1/9 quieter than
  harmonic number 1, because the harmonic 3 squared is 9 (3 X 3) and the
  reciprocal of 9 is 1/9.
    As you can see, there is a similarity in shape of a triangular wave to
  a sine wave oscillating at the fundamental frequency.
    Sawtooth waves contain all the harmonics. The amount of each harmonic
  present is proportional to the reciprocal of the harmonic number. For
  example, harmonic number 2 is 1/2 as loud as harmonic number 1.
    The square wave contains odd harmonics in proportion to the reciprocal
  of the harmonic number. Other rectangular waves have varying harmonic
  content. By changing the pulse width, the timbre of the sound of a
  rectangular wave can be varied tremendously.

    By choosing carefully the waveform used, you can start with a harmonic
  structure that looks somewhat like the sound you want. To refine the
  sound, you can add another aspect of sound quality available on your
  Commodore 64 called filtering, which we'll discuss later in this section."

"In the context of the C64, explain the vertical positionning of sprites","VERTICAL POSITIONING

    Setting up positions in the horizontal direction is a little more
  difficult than vertical positioning, so we'll discuss vertical (Y)
  positioning first.
    There are 200 different dot positions that can be individually pro-
  grammed onto your TV screen in the Y direction. The sprite Y position
  registers can handle numbers up to 255. This means that you have more
  than enough register locations to handle moving a sprite up and down. You
  also want to be able to smoothly move a sprite on and off the screen.
  More than 200 values are needed for this.
    The first on-screen value from the top of the screen, and in the Y
  direction for an unexpanded sprite is 30. For a sprite expanded in the Y
  direction it would be 9. (Since each dot is twice as tall, this makes a
  certain amount of sense, as the initial position is STILL calculated from
  the top left corner of the sprite.)
    The first Y value in which a sprite (expanded or not) is fully on the
  screen (all 21 possible lines displayed) is 50.
    The last Y value in which an unexpanded sprite is fully on the screen
  is 229. The last Y value in which an expanded sprite is fully on the

"In the context of the C64, What is the starting location of the VIC-II chip in the Commodore 64's memory?","GRAPHICS LOCATIONS

    Some general information first. There are 1000 possible locations on
  the Commodore 64 screen. Normally, the screen starts at location 1024
  ($0400 in HEXadecimal notation) and goes to location 2023. Each of
  these locations is 8 bits wide. This means that it can hold any integer
  number from 0 to 255. Connected with screen memory is a group of 1000
  locations called COLOR MEMORY or COLOR RAM. These start at location 55296
  ($D800 in HEX) and go up to 56295. Each of the color RAM locations is 4
  bits wide, which means that it can hold any integer number from 0 to 15.
  Since there are 16 possible colors that the Commodore 64 can use, this
  works out well.
    In addition, there are 256 different characters that can be displayed
  at any time. For normal screen display, each of the 1000 locations in
  screen memory contains a code number which tells the VIC-II chip which
  character to display at that screen location.
    The various graphics modes are selected by the 47 CONTROL registers in
  the VIC-II chip. Many of the graphics functions can be controlled by
  POKEing the correct value into one of the registers. The VIC-II chip is
  located starting at 53248 ($D000 in HEX) through 53294 ($D02E in HEX)."
"In the context of the C64, What are the key characteristics of the ADSR envelope generator in the SID chip?","SID ENVELOPE GENERATORS

    The four-part ADSR (ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, RELEASE) envelope generator
  has been proven in electronic music to provide the optimum trade-off
  between flexibility and ease of amplitude control. Appropriate selection
  of envelope parameters allows the simulation of a wide range 2: of
  percussion and sustained instruments. The violin is a good example of a
  sustained instrument. The violinist controls the volume by bowing the
  instrument. Typically, the volume builds slowly, reaches a peak, then
  drops to an intermediate level. The violinist can maintain this level for
  as long as desired, then the volume is allowed to slowly die away.
    Note that the tone can be held at the intermediate SUSTAIN level for
  as long as desired. The tone will not begin to die away until GATE is
  cleared. With minor alterations, this basic envelope can be used for
  brass and woodwinds as well as strings.
    An entirely different form of envelope is produced by percussion in-
  struments such as drums, cymbals and gongs, as well as certain
  keyboards such as pianos and harpsichords. The percussion envelope is
  characterized by a nearly instantaneous attack, immediately followed by
  a decay to zero volume. Percussion instruments cannot be sustained at
  a constant amplitude. For example, the instant a drum is struck, the
  sound reaches full volume and decays rapidly regardless of how it was
  struck.

    Note that the tone immediately begins to decay to zero amplitude after
  the peak is reached, regardless of when GATE is cleared. The amplitude
  envelope of pianos and harpsichords is somewhat more complicated, but can
  be generated quite easily with the ADSR. These instruments reach full
  volume when a key is first struck. The amplitude immediately begins to
  die away slowly as long as the key remains depressed. If the key is
  released before the sound has fully died away, the amplitude will
  immediately drop to zero. 
    Note that the tone decays slowly until GATE is cleared, at which point
  the amplitude drops rapidly to zero.
    The most simple envelope is that of the organ, When a key is pressed,
  the tone immediately reaches full volume and remains there. When the key
  is released, the tone drops immediately to zero volume. 
    The real power of SID lies in the ability to create original sounds
  rather than simulations of acoustic instruments. The ADSR is capable of
  creating envelopes which do not correspond to any 'real' instruments. A
  good example would be the 'backwards' envelope. This envelope is
  characterized by a slow attack and rapid decay which sounds very much
  like an instrument that has been recorded on tape then played backwards.
 
    Many unique sounds can be created by applying the amplitude envelope of
  one instrument to the harmonic structure of another. This produces sounds
  similar to familiar acoustic instruments, yet notably different. In
  general, sound is quite subjective and experimentation with various
  envelope rates and harmonic contents will be necessary in order to
  achieve the desired sound."

  PROGRAMMING SPRITES - ANOTHER LOOK

    For those of you having trouble with graphics, this section has been
  designed as a more elementary tutorial approach to sprites."
"In the context of the C64, What are the different graphics display modes supported by the Commodore 64's 6567 Video Interface Chip (VIC-II chip)?","GRAPHICS OVERVIEW

  All of the graphics abilities of the Commodore 64 come from the 6567
  Video Interface Chip (also known as the VIC-II chip). This chip gives a
  variety of graphics modes, including a 40 column by 25 line text display,
  a 320 by 200 dot high resolution display, and SPRITES, small movable
  objects which make writing games simple. And if this weren't enough,
  many of the graphics modes can be mixed on the same screen. It is
  possible, for example, to define the top half of the screen to be in
  high resolution mode, while the bottom half is in text mode. And SPRITES
  will combine with anything! More on sprites later. First the other
  graphics modes.
   The VIC-II chip has the following graphics display modes:

  A) CHARACTER DISPLAY MODES

     1) Standard Character Mode
            a)ROM characters
            b)RAM programmable characters
     2) Multi-Color Character Mode
            a)ROM characters
            b)RAM programmable characters

     3) Extended Background Color Mode
            a)ROM characters
            b)RAM programmable characters


  B) BIT MAP MODES

     1) Standard Bit Map Mode
     2) Multi-Color Bit Map Mode


  C) SPRITES

"In the context of the C64, What is the starting point for calculating the position of a sprite in a 24x21 dot area?","The position of a sprite is calculated from the TOP LEFT corner of the
  24 dot by 21 dot area that your sprite can be designed in. It does NOT
  matter how many or how few dots you use to make up a sprite. Even if only
  one dot is used as a sprite, and you happen to want it in the middle of
  the screen, you must still calculate the exact positioning by starting at
  the top left corner location."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the OPEN function in the KERNAL routines?","B-18. Function Name: OPEN


    Purpose: Open a logical file
    Call address: $FFC0 (hex) 65472 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
    Error returns: 1,2,4,5,6,240, READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to OPEN a logical file. Once the
  logical file is set up, it can be used for input/output operations. Most
  of the I/O KERNAL routines call on this routine to create the logical
  files to operate on. No arguments need to be set up to use this routine,
  but both the SETLFS and SETNAM KERNAL routines must be called before
  using this routine.


  How to Use:

    0) Use the SETLFS routine.
    1) Use the SETNAM routine.
    2) Call this routine."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the CHRIN  kernal function?","B-4. Function Name: CHRIN

    Purpose: Get a character from the input channel
    Call address: $FFCF (hex) 65487 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: (OPEN, CHKIN)
    Error returns: 0 (See READST)
    Stack requirements: 7+
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine gets a byte of data from a channel already
  set up as the input channel by the KERNAL routine CHKIN. If the CHKIN has
  NOT been used to define another input channel, then all your data is
  expected from the keyboard. The data byte is returned in the accumulator.
  The channel remains open after the call.
    Input from the keyboard is handled in a special way. First, the cursor
  is turned on, and blinks until a carriage return is typed on the
  keyboard. All characters on the line (up to 88 characters) are stored in
  the BASIC input buffer. These characters can be retrieved one at a time
  by calling this routine once for each character. When the carriage return
  is retrieved, the entire line has been processed. The next time this
  routine is called, the whole process begins again, i.e., by flashing the
  cursor.

  How to Use:

  FROM THE KEYBOARD

    1) Retrieve a byte of data by calling this routine.
    2) Store the data byte.
    3) Check if it is the last data byte (is it a CR?)
    4) If not, go to step 1.

"In the context of the C64, What is the primary function of the program counter in a C64?","THE PROGRAM COUNTER

    This contains the address of the current machine language instruction
  being executed. Since the operating system is always 'RUN'ning in the
  Commodore 64 (or, for that matter, any computer), the program counter is
  always changing. It could only be stopped by halting the microprocessor
  in some way."
"In the context of the C64, Explain the sid envelop generator?","SID: THE ENVELOPE GENERATOR

    The volume of a musical tone changes from the moment you first hear it,
  all the way through until it dies out and you can't hear it anymore. When
  a note is first struck, it rises from zero volume to its peak volume. The
  rate at which this happens is called the ATTACK. Then, it fails from the
  peak to some middle-ranged volume. The rate at which the fall of the note
  occurs is called the DECAY. The mid-ranged volume itself is called the
  SUSTAIN level. And finally, when the note stops playing, it fails from
  the SUSTAIN level to zero volume. The rate at which it fails is called
  the RELEASE. 


    Each of the items mentioned above give certain qualities and restric-
  tions to a note. The bounds are called parameters.
    The parameters ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN/RELEASE and collectively called
  ADSR, can be controlled by your use of another set of locations in the
  sound generator chip. LOAD your first example program again. RUN it again
  and remember how it sounds."

"In the context of the C64, How do I open an RS-232 communication?","OPENING AN RS-232 CHANNEL

    Only one RS-232 channel should be open at any time; a second OPEN
  statement will cause the buffer pointers to be reset. Any characters in
  either the transmit buffer or the receive buffer will be lost.
    Up to 4 characters can be sent in the filename field. The first two are
  the control and command register characters; the other two are reserved
  for future system options. Baud rate, parity, and other options can be
  selected through this feature.
    No error-checking is done on the control word to detect a non-
  implemented baud rate. Any illegal control word will cause the system
  output to operate at a very slow rate (below 50 baud).

  BASIC SYNTAX:

    OPEN lfn,2,0,'<control register><command register><opt baud low><opt
  baud high>'
    lfn-The logical file number (lfn) then can be any number from 1 through
  255. But be aware of the fact that if you choose a logical file number
  that is greater than 127, then a line feed will follow all carriage
  returns.
               
    <control register>- Is a single byte character (see Figure 6-1, Control
  Register Map) required to specify the baud rates. If the lower 4 bits of
  the baud rate is equal to zero (0), the <opt baud low><opt baud high>
  characters give you a rate based on the following:
    <opt baud low>=<system frequency/rate/2-100-<opt baud high>*256
    <opt baud high>=INT((system frequency/rate/2-100)/256

 
                    
  The formulas above are based on the fact that:

    system frequency = 1.02273E6 NTSC (North American TV standard)
                     = 0.98525E6 PAL (U.K. and most European TV standard)

    <command register>- Is a single byte character (see Figure 6-2, Command
  Register Map) that defines other terminal parameters. This character is
  NOT required.

  KERNAL ENTRY:

    OPEN ($FFC0) (See KERNAL specifications for more information on entry
  conditions and instructions.)


IMPORTANT NOTE: In a BASIC program, the RS-232 OPEN command should be
  | performed before creating any variables or arrays because an automatic|
  | CLR is performed when an RS-232 channel is OPENed (This is due to the |
  | allocation of 512 bytes at the top of memory.) Also remember that your|
  | program will be destroyed if 512 bytes of space are not available at  |
  | the time of the OPEN statement.                                       |"
"In the context of the C64, What are the common methods to add machine language programs to a BASIC program?","HOW TO ENTER MACHINE LANGUAGE

    There are 3 common methods to add the machine language programs to a
  BASIC program. They are:

  1-DATA STATEMENTS:

    By READing DATA statements, and POKEing the values into memory at the
  start of the program, machine language routines can be added. This is the
  easiest method. No special methods are needed to save the two parts of
  the program, and it is fairly easy to debug. The drawbacks include taking
  up more memory space, and the wait while the program is POKED in.
  Therefore, this method is better for smaller routines.

"In the context of the C64, How can I handle the paddles?","PADDLES

    A paddle is connected to both CIA #1 and the SID chip (MOS 6581 Sound
  Interface Device) through a game port. The paddle value is read via the
  SID registers 54297 ($D419) and 54298 ($D41A). PADDLES ARE NOT RELIABLE
  WHEN READ FROM BASIC ALONE!!!! The best way to use paddles, from BASIC or

"In the context of the C64, WHow can I output to a Commodore printer?","OUTPUT TO PRINTER

    The printer is an output device similar to the screen. Your main con-
  cern when sending output to the printer is to create a format that is
  easy on the eyes. Your tools here include reversed, double-width, capital
  and lower case letters, as well as dot-programmable graphics.
    The SPC function works for the printer in the same way it works for the
  screen. However, the TAB function does not work correctly on the printer,
  because it calculates the current position on the line based on the
  cursor's position on the screen, not on the paper.
    The OPEN statement for the printer creates the channel for communi-
  cation. It also specifies which character set will be used, either upper
  case with graphics or upper and lower case.

  EXAMPLES of OPEN Statement for Printer:

    OPEN 1,4: REM UPPER CASE/GRAPHICS
    OPEN 1,4,7: REM UPPER AND LOWER CASE

    When working with one character set, individual lines can be PRINTed
  in the opposite character set. When in upper case with graphics, the
  cursor down character (CHR$(17)) switches the characters to the upper
  and lower case set. When in upper and lower case, the cursor up char-
  acter (CHR$(145)) allows upper case and graphics characters to be
  PRINTed.
    Other special functions in the printer are controlled through character
  codes. All these codes are simply PRINTed just like any other character.

  modules.

    1) The BASIC Interpreter
    2) The KERNAL
    3) The Screen Editor

    1) The BASIC Interpreter is responsible for analysing BASIC statement
       syntax and for performing the required calculations and/or data
       manipulation. The BASIC Interpreter has a vocabulary of 65
       'keywords' which have special meanings. The upper and lower case
       alphabet and the digits 0-9 are used to make both keywords and
       variable names. Certain punctuation characters and special symbols
       also have meanings for the Interpreter. Table 1-1 lists the special
       characters and their uses.
    2) The KERNAL handles most of the interrupt level processing in the
       system (for details on interrupt level processing, see Chapter 5).
       The KERNAL also does the actual input and output of data.
    3) The Screen Editor controls the output to the video screen (tele-
       vision set) and the editing of BASIC program text. In addition, the
       Screen Editor intercepts keyboard input so that it can decide
       whether the characters put in should be acted upon immediately, or

    Description: This routine LOADs data bytes from any input device di-
  rectly into the memory of the Commodore 64. It can also be used for a
  verify operation, comparing data from a device with the data already in
  memory, while leaving the data stored in RAM unchanged.
    The accumulator (.A) must be set to 0 for a LOAD operation, or 1 for a
  verify, If the input device is OPENed with a secondary address (SA) of 0
  the header information from the device is ignored. In this case, the X
  and Y registers must contain the starting address for the load. If the
  device is addressed with a secondary address of 1, then the data is
  loaded into memory starting at the location specified by the header. This
  routine returns the address of the highest RAM location loaded.
    Before this routine can be called, the KERNAL SETLFS, and SETNAM
  routines must be called.


NOTE: You can NOT LOAD from the keyboard (0), RS-232 (2), or the screen (3).

  How to Use:

    0) Call the SETLFS, and SETNAM routines. If a relocated load is de-
       sired, use the SETLFS routine to send a secondary address of 0.
    1) Set the A register to 0 for load, 1 for verify.

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the raster register in the VIC-II chip?","RASTER REGISTER

    The raster register is found in the VIC-II chip at location 53266
  ($D012). The raster register is a dual purpose register. When you read
  this register it returns the lower 8 bits of the current raster position.
  The raster position of the most significant bit is in register location
  53265 ($D011). You use the raster register to set up timing changes in
  your display so that you can get rid of screen flicker. The changes on
  your screen should be mode when the raster is not in the visible display
  area, which is when your dot positions fall between 51 and 251.
    When the raster register is written to (including the MSB) the number
  written to is saved for use with the raster compare function. When the
  actual raster value becomes the same as the number written to the raster
  register, a bit in the VIC-II chip interrupt register 53273 ($D019) is
  turned ON by setting it to 1.

   NOTE: If the proper interrupt bit is enabled (turned on), an interrupt
   (IRQ) will occur."
"In the context of the C64, What determines the order in which sprites appear in a scene?","SPRITE DISPLAY PRIORITIES

    Sprites have the ability to cross each other's paths, as well as cross
  in front of, or behind other objects on the screen. This can give you a
  truly three dimensional effect for games.
    Sprite to sprite priority is fixed. That means that sprite 0 has the
  highest priority, sprite 1 has the next priority, and so on, until we get
  to sprite 7, which has the lowest priority. In other words, if sprite 1
  and sprite 6 are positioned so that they cross each other, sprite 1 will
  be in front of sprite 6.
    So when you're planning which sprites will appear to be in the fore-
  ground of the picture, they must be assigned lower sprite numbers than
  those sprites you want to put towards the back of the scene. Those
  sprites will be given higher sprite numbers,

NOTE: A 'window' effect is possible. If a sprite with higher priority 
has 'holes' in it (areas where the dots are not set to 1 and thus     
turned ON), the sprite with the lower priority will show through. This
also happens with sprite and background data."

"In the context of the C64, What information about the SID chip's parameters can be changed dynamically during a note or sound to create many interesting and fun effects?","SOUND  ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

    The SID chip's parameters can be changed dynamically during a note or
  sound to create many interesting and fun effects. In order to make this
  easy to do, digitized outputs from oscillator three and envelope
  generator three are available for you in registers 27 and 28, respec-
  tively.
    The output of oscillator 3 (register 27) is directly related to the
  waveform selected. If you choose the sawtooth waveform of oscillator 3,
  this register will present a series of numbers incremented (increased
  step by step) from 0 to 255 at a rate determined by the frequency of
  oscillator 3. If you choose the triangle waveform, the output will incre-
  ment from 0 up to 255, then decrement (decrease step by step) back down
  to 0. If you choose the pulse wave, the output will jump back-and-forth
  between 0 and 255. Finally, choosing the noise waveform will give you a
  series of random numbers. When oscillator 3 is used for modulation, you
  usually do NOT want to hear its output. Setting bit 7 of register 24
  turns the audio output of voice 3 off. Register 27 always reflects the
  changing output of the oscillator and is not affected in any way by the
  envelope (ADSR) generator.
    Register 25 gives you access to the output of the envelope generator
  of oscillator 3. It functions in much the same fashion that the output of
  oscillator 3 does. The oscillator must be turned on to produce any output
  from this register.
    Vibrato (a rapid variation in frequency) can be achieved by adding the
  output of oscillator 3 to the frequency of another oscillator. Example
  Program 6 illustrates this idea."

"In the context of the C64, What is the recommended location for machine language routines on the Commodore 64?","WHERE TO PUT MACHINE LANGUAGE ROUTINES

    The best place for machine language routines on the Commodore 64 is
  from $C000-$CFFF, assuming the routines are smaller than 4K bytes long.
  This section of memory is not disturbed by BASIC.
    If for some reason it's not possible or desirable to put the machine
  language routine at $C000, for instance if the routine is larger than 4K
  bytes, it then becomes necessary to reserve an area at the top of memory
  from BASIC for the routine. The top of memory is normally $9FFF. The top
  of memory can be changed through the KERNAL routine MEMTOP, or by the
  following BASIC statements:

    10 POKE51,L:POKE52,H:POKE55,1:POKE56,H:CLR

  Where H and L are the high and low portions, respectively, of the new
  top of memory. For example, to reserve the area from $9000 to $9FFF for
  machine language, use the following:

    10 POKE5110:POKE52,144:POKE5510:POKE56,144:CLR"
"In the context of the C64, how can I send data to a modem?","OUTPUT TO MODEM

    The modem is a simple device that can translate character codes into
  audio pulses and vice-versa, so that computers can communicate over
  telephone lines. The OPEN statement for the modem sets up the parameters
  to match the speed and format of the other computer you are communicating
  with. Two characters can be sent in the string at the end
  of the OPEN statement.
    The bit positions of the first character code determine the baud rate,
  number of data bits, and number of stop bits. The second code is op-
  tional, and its bits specify the parity and duplex of the transmission.
  See the RS-232 section or your VICMODEM manual for specific details on
  this device.

  EXAMPLE of OPEN Statement for Modem:

    OPEN 1,2,0,CHR$(6): REM 300 BAUD
    100 OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(163) CHR$(112): REM 110 BAUD, ETC.

    Most computers use the American Standard Code for Information In-
  terchange, known as ASCII (pronounced ASK-KEY). This standard set of
  character codes is somewhat different from the codes used in the Com-
  modore 64. When communicating with other computers, the Commodore
  character codes must be translated into their ASCII counterparts. A table
  of standard ASCII codes is included in this book in Appendix C.
    Output to the modem is a fairly uncomplicated task, aside from the need
  for character translation. However, you must know the receiving device
  fairly well, especially when writing programs where your computer 'talks'
  to another computer without human intervention. An example of this would
  be a terminal program that automatically types in your account number and
  secret password. To do this successfully, you must carefully count the
  number of characters and RETURN characters. Otherwise, the computer
  receiving the characters won't know what to do with them."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary purpose of the X index register in a C64?","THE X INDEX REGISTER

    This is a very important register. There are instructions for nearly
  all of the transformations you can make to the accumulator. But there are
  other instructions for things that only the X register can do. Various

    Description: Any logical file that has already been opened by the
  KERNAL OPEN routine can be defined as an input channel by this routine.
  Naturally, the device on the channel must be an input device. Otherwise
  an error will occur, and the routine will abort.
    If you are getting data from anywhere other than the keyboard, this
  routine must be called before using either the CHRIN or the GETIN KERNAL
  routines for data input. If you want to use the input from the keyboard,
  and no other input channels are opened, then the calls to this routine,
  and to the OPEN routine are not needed.
    When this routine is used with a device on the serial bus, it auto-
  matically sends the talk address (and the secondary address if one was
  specified by the OPEN routine) over the bus.

  How to Use:

    0) OPEN the logical file (if necessary; see description above).
    1) Load the X register with number of the logical file to be used.
    2) Call this routine (using a JSR command).

"In the context of the C64, What is the native language of the Commodore 64?","WHAT IS MACHINE LANGUAGE?

    At the heart of every microcomputer, is a central microprocessor. It's
  a very special microchip which is the 'brain' of the computer. The
  Commodore 64 is no exception. Every microprocessor understands its own
  language of instructions. These instructions are called machine language
  instructions. To put it more precisely, machine language is the ONLY
  programming language that your Commodore 64 understands. It is the NATIVE
  language of the machine.
    If machine language is the only language that the Commodore 64
  understands, then how does it understand the CBM BASIC programming
  language? CBM BASIC is NOT the machine language of the Commodore 64.
  What, then, makes the Commodore 64 understand CBM BASIC instructions like
  PRINT and GOTO?
    To answer this question, you must first see what happens inside your
  Commodore 64. Apart from the microprocessor which is the brain of the
  Commodore 64, there is a machine language program which is stored in a
  special type of memory so that it can't be changed. And, more impor-
  tantly, it does not disappear when the Commodore 64 is turned off, unlike
  a program that you may have written. This machine language program is
  called the OPERATING SYSTEM of the Commodore 64. Your Commodore 64 knows
  what to do when it's turned on because its OPERATING SYSTEM (program) is
  automatically 'RUN.'"

"In the context of the C64, What are the two character sets available on the Commodore 64, and how can you switch between them?","The Commodore 64 has two complete character sets that you can use
  either from the keyboard or in your programs.
    In SET 1, the upper case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. If you hold down the <SHIFT> key
  while typing, the graphics characters on the RIGHT side of the front of
  the keys are used. If you hold down the <C=> key while typing, the
  graphics characters on the LEFT side of the front of the key are used.
  Holding down the <SHIFT> key while typing any character that doesn't
  have graphic symbols on the front of the key gives you the symbol on the
  top most part of the key.
    In SET 2, the lower case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. The upper case alphabet is available
  when you hold down the <SHIFT> key while typing. Again, the graphic
  symbols on the LEFT side of the front of the keys are displayed by press-
  ing the <C=> key, while the symbols on the top most part of any key
  without graphics characters are selected when you hold down the <SHIFT>
  key while typing.

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and functionality of the MEMTOP routine in kernal?","B-17. Function Name: MEMTOP

    Purpose: Set the top of RAM
    Call address: $FF99 (hex) 65433 (decimal)
    Communication registers: X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to set the top of RAM. When this
  routine is called with the carry bit of the accumulator set, the pointer
  to the top of RAM will be loaded into the X and Y registers. When this
  routine is called with the accumulator carry bit clear, the contents of
  the X and Y registers are loaded in the top of memory pointer, changing
  the top of memory.

  EXAMPLE:
    ;DEALLOCATE THE RS-232 BUFFER

    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: CHKIN, OPEN
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 7+
    Registers affected: A (X, Y)

    Description: If the channel is the keyboard, this subroutine removes
  one character from the keyboard queue and returns it as an ASCII value in
  the accumulator. If the queue is empty, the value returned in the
  accumulator will be zero. Characters are put into the queue automatically
  by an interrupt driven keyboard scan routine which calls the SCNKEY
  routine. The keyboard buffer can hold up to ten characters. After the
  buffer is filled, additional characters are ignored until at least one
  character has been removed from the queue. If the channel is RS-232, then
  only the A register is used and a single character is returned. See
  READST to check validity. If the channel is serial, cassette, or screen,
  call BASIN routine.


  How to Use:

    1) Call this routine using a JSR instruction.
    2) Check for a zero in the accumulator (empty buffer).
    3) Process the data.

    Error returns:
    Stack requirements: 9
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine is called to clear all open channels and re-
  store the I/O channels to their original default values. It is usually
  called after opening other I/O channels (like a tape or disk drive) and
  using them for input/output operations. The default input device is 0
  (keyboard). The default output device is 3 (the Commodore 64 screen).
    If one of the channels to be closed is to the serial port, an UNTALK
  signal is sent first to clear the input channel or an UNLISTEN is sent to
  clear the output channel. By not calling this routine (and leaving lis-
  tener(s) active on the serial bus) several devices can receive the same
  data from the Commodore 64 at the same time. One way to take advantage
  of this would be to command the printer to TALK and the disk to LISTEN.
  This would allow direct printing of a disk file.

"In the context of the C64, What are the key considerations and limitations when positioning sprites horizontally in a graphics system?","HORIZONTAL POSITIONING

    Positioning in the horizontal direction is more complicated because
  there are more than, 256 positions. This means that an extra bit, or 9th
  bit is used to control the X position. By adding the extra bit when
  necessary a sprite now has 512 possible positions in the left/right, X,
  direction. This makes more possible combinations than can be seen on the
  visible part of the screen. Each sprite can have a position from 0 to
  511. However, only those values between 24 and 343 are visible on the
  screen. If the X position of a sprite is greater than 255 (on the right
  side of the screen), the bit in the X MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT POSITION

  register must be set to a 1 (turned ON). If the X position of a sprite is
  less than 256 (on the left side of the screen), then the X MSB of that
  sprite must be 0 (turned OFF). Bits 0 to 7 of the X MSB register
  correspond to sprites 0 to 7, respectively."
"In the context of the C64, how sprite to sprite collision works?","SPRITE TO SPRITE COLLISIONS

    Sprite to sprite collisions are recognized by the computer, or flagged,
  in the sprite to sprite collision register at location 53278 ($D01E in
  HEX) in the VIC-II chip control register. Each sprite has a bit in this
  register. If that bit is a 1, then that sprite is involved in a
  collision. The bits in this register will remain set until read (PEEKed).
  Once read, the register is automatically cleared, so it is a good idea to
  save the value in a variable until you are finished with it.
  
   NOTE: Collisions can take place even when the sprites are off screen."
"In the context of the C64, What are the two modes of BASIC operation provided by the Operating System?","The Operating System gives you two modes of BASIC operation:
    1) DIRECT Mode

    1) When you're using the DIRECT mode, BASIC statements don't have
       line numbers in front of the statement. They are executed whenever
       the <RETURN> key is pressed.
    2) The PROGRAM mode is the one you use for running programs.
       When using the PROGRAM mode, all of your BASIC statements must have
       line numbers in front of them. You can have more than one BASIC
       statement in a line of your program, but the number of statements is
       limited by the fact that you can only put 80 characters on a logical
       screen line. This means that if you are going to go over the 80
       character limit you have to put the entire BASIC statement that
       doesn't fit on a new line with a new line number.

"In the context of the C64, What is the primary function of the OPERATING SYSTEM in a Commodore 64 computer?","The C64 OPERATING SYSTEM is in charge of 'organizing' all the memory in

"In the context of the C64, What is the primary purpose of the Y index register in a C64?","THE Y INDEX REGISTER

    This is a very important register. There are instructions for nearly
  all of the transformations you can make to the accumulator, and the X
  register. But there are other instructions for things that only the Y
  register can do. Various machine language instructions allow you to copy
  the contents of a memory location into the Y register, copy the contents
  of the Y register into a memory location, and modify the contents of the
  Y, or some other register directly."
"In the context of the C64, describe how the ligth pen works","LIGHT PEN

    The light pen input latches the current screen position into a pair of
  registers (LPX, LPY) on a low-going edge. The X position register 19
  ($13) will contain the 8 MSB of the X position at the time of transition.
  Since the X position is defined by a 512-state counter (9 bits),
  resolution to 2 horizontal dots is provided. Similarly, the Y position is
  latched in its register 20 ($14), but here 8 bits provide single raster
  resolution within the visible display. The light pen latch may be
  triggered only once per frame, and subsequent triggers within the same
  frame will have no effect. Therefore, you must take several samples
  before turning the pen to the screen (3 or more samples average),
  depending upon the characteristics of your light pen."
"In the context of the C64, What are some key considerations when working with cassette tapes for data storage?","WORKING WITH CASSETTE TAPE

    Cassette tapes have an almost unlimited capacity for data. The longer
  the tape, the more information it can store. However, tapes are limited
  in time. The more data on the tape, the longer the time it takes to find
  the information.
    The programmer must try to minimize the time factor when working with
  tape storage. One common practice is to read the entire cassette data
  file into RAM, then process it, and then re-write all the data on the
  tape. This allows you to sort, edit, and examine your data. However, this
  limits the size of your files to the amount of available RAM.
    If your data file is larger than the available RAM, it is probably time
  to switch to using the floppy disk. The disk can read data at any
  position on the disk, without needing to read through all the other data.
  You can write data over old data without disturbing the rest of the file.
  That's why the disk is used for all business applications like ledgers
  and mailing lists.
    The PRINT# statement formats data just like the PRINT statement does.
  All punctuation works the same. But remember, you're not working with the
  screen now. The formatting must be done with the INPUT# statement
  constantly in mind.

    Consider the statement PRINT# 1, A$, B$, C$. When used with the screen,
  the commas between the variables provide enough blank space between items
  to format them into columns ten characters wide. On cassette, anywhere
  from 1 to 10 spaces will be added, depending on th length of the strings.
  This wastes space on your tape.
    Even worse is what happens when the INPUT# statement tries to read
  these strings. The statement INPUT# 1, A$, B$, C$ will discover no data
  for B$ and C$. A$ will contain all three variables, plus the spaces be-
  tween them. What happens? Here's a look at the tape file:

    A$='DOG' B$='CAT' C$='TREE'
    PRINT# 1, A$, B$, C$

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
    D O G                 C  A  T                       T  R  E  E  RETURN

    The INPUT# statement works like the regular INPUT statement. When
  typing data into the INPUT statement, the data items are separated,
  either by hitting the <RETURN> key or using commas to separate them. The
  PRINT# statement puts a RETURN at the end of a line just like the PRINT
  statement. A$ fills up with all three values because there's no separator
  on the tape between them, only after all three.
    A proper separator would be a comma (,) or a RETURN on the tape. The
  RETURN code is automatically put at the end of a PRINT or PRINT#
  statement. One way to put the RETURN code between each item is to us only
  one item per PRINT# statement. A better way is to set a variable to the
  RETURN CHR$ code, which is CHR$(13), or use a comma. The statement for
  this is R$=',':PRINT#1, A$ R$ B$ R$ C$. Don't use commas or any other
  punctuation between the variable names, since the Commodore 64 can tell
  them apart and they'll only use up space in your program.
    A proper tape file looks like this:

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13

    D O G , C A T , T  R  E  E  RETURN

    The GET# statement will pick data from the tape one character at a
  time. It will receive each character, including the RETURN code and other
  punctuation. The CHR$(0) code is received as an empty string, not as a
  one character string with a code of 0. If you try to use the ASC function
  on an empty string, you get the error message ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR.

    The line GET# 1, A$: A= ASC(A$) is commonly used in programs to examine
  tape data. To avoid error messages, the line should be modified to
  GET#1, A$: A=ASC(A$+CHR$(0)). The CHR$(0) at the end acts as insurance
  against empty strings, but doesn't affect the ASC function when there are
  other characters in A$."

    Multi-color mode provides additional color flexibility allowing up to

  color mode is selected by setting the MCM bit in register 22 ($16) to
  '1,' which causes the dot data stored in the character base to be

  '0,' the character will be displayed as described in standard character
  mode, allowing the two modes to be inter-mixed (however, only the lower
  order 8 colors are available). When the MSB of the color nybble is a '1'
  (if MCM:MSB(CM) = 1) the character bits are interpreted in the multi-
  color mode:

    As in standard (HI-RES) bit mapped mode, there is a one to one cor-
  respondence between the 8K section of memory being used for the display,
  and what is shown on the screen. However, the horizontal dots are two
  bits wide. Each 2 bits in the display memory area form a dot, which can
  have one of 4 colors."
"In the context of the C64, What should be done to minimize noise in the SID Vcc line?","VCC (Pin 25)

    As with the GND line, a separate +5 VDC line should be run between SID
  Vcc and the power supply in order to minimize noise. A bypass capacitor
  should be located close to the pin."
"In the context of the C64, Can you describe the filter register of the SID?","FILTER

  FC LO/FC HI (Registers $15,$16)

    Together these registers form an 11-bit number (bits 3-7 of FC LO are
  not used) which linearly controls the Cutoff (or Center) Frequency of the
  programmable Filter. The approximate Cutoff Frequency ranges from 30
  Hz to 12 KHz.

  RES/FILT (Register $17)

    Bits 4-7 of this register (RES0-RES3) control the resonance of the
  filter. Resonance is a peaking effect which emphasizes frequency com-
  ponents at the Cutoff Frequency of the Filter, causing a sharper sound.
  There are 16 resonance settings ranging linearly from no resonance (0) to
  maximum resonance (15 or $F). Bits 0-3 determine which signals will be
  routed through the Filter:
    FILT 1 (Bit 0): When set to a zero, Voice 1 appears directly at the
  audio output and the Filter has no effect on it. When set to a one, Voice
  1 will be processed through the Filter and the harmonic content of Voice
  1 will be altered according to the selected Filter parameters.
    FILT 2 (Bit 1): Same as bit 0 for Voice 2.
    FILT 3 (Bit 2): Same as bit 0 for Voice 3.
    FILTEX (Bit 3): Same as bit 0 for External audio input (pin 26)."
"In the context of the C64, What is the MODE/VOL (Register $18) register?","MODE/VOL (Register $18)

    Bits 4-7 of this register select various Filter mode and output
  options:
    LP (Bit 4): When set to a one, the Low-Pass output of the Filter is
  selected and sent to the audio output. For a given Filter input signal,
  all frequency components below the Filter Cutoff Frequency are passed
  unaltered, while all frequency components above the Cutoff are attenuated
  at a rate of 12 dB/Octave. The Low-Pass mode produces fullbodied sounds.
    BP (Bit 5): Same as bit 4 for the Bandpass output. All frequency
  components above and below the Cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 6
  dB/Octave. The Bandpass mode produces thin, open sounds.
    HP (Bit 6): Same as bit 4 for the High-Pass output. All frequency
  components above the Cutoff are passed unaltered, while all frequency
  components below the Cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 12 dB/Octave.
  The High-Pass mode produces tinny, buzzy sounds.
    3 OFF (Bit 7): When set to a one, the output of Voice 3 is disconnected
  from the direct audio path. Setting Voice 3 to bypass the Filter
  (FILT 3 = 0) and setting 3 OFF to a one prevents Voice 3 from reaching
  the audio output. This allows Voice 3 to be used for modulation purposes
  without any undesirable output.

  | NOTE: The Filter output modes ARE additive and multiple Filter modes  |
  | may be selected simultaneously. For example, both LP and HP modes can |
  | be selected to produce a Notch (or Band Reject) Filter response. In   |
  | order for the Filter to have any audible effect, at least one Filter  |
  | output must be selected and at least one Voice must be routed through |
  | the Filter. The Filter is, perhaps, the most important element in SID |
  | as it allows the generation of complex tone colors via subtractive    |
  | synthesis (the Filter is used to eliminate specific frequency         |
  | components from a harmonically rich input signal). The best results   |
  | are achieved by varying the Cutoff Frequency in real-time.            |


    Bits 0-3 (VOL0-VOL3) select 1 of 16 overall Volume levels for the final
  composite audio output. The output volume levels range from no output (0)
  to maximum volume (15 or $F) in 16 linear steps. This control can be used
  as a static volume control for balancing levels in multi-chip systems or
  for creating dynamic volume effects, such as Tremolo. Some Volume level
  other than zero must be selected in order for SID to produce any sound."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the EXT IN pin on the SID chip?","EXT IN (Pin 26)

    This analog input allows external audio signals to be mixed with the
  audio output of SID or processed through the Filter. Typical sources in-
  clude voice, guitar, and organ. The input impedance of this pin is on the
  order of 100 kohms. Any signal applied directly to the pin should ride at
  a DC level of 6 volts and should not exceed 3 volts p-p. In order to pre-

  vent any interference caused by DC level differences, external signals
  should be AC-coupled to EXT IN by an electrolytic capacitor in the 1-10
  uF range. As the direct audio path (FILTEX=0) has unity gain, EXT IN can
  be used to mix outputs of many SID chips by daisy-chaining. The number of
  chips that can be chained in this manner is determined by the amount of
  noise and distortion allowable at the final output. Note that the output
  Volume control will affect not only the three SID voices, but also any
  external inputs."
"In the context of the C64, How is the bit map mode works on C64?","There are two types of bit mapping available on the Commodore 64.
  They are:

    1) Standard (high-resolution) bit mapped mode (320-dot by 200-dot
       resolution)

    2) Multi-color bit mapped mode (160-dot by 200-dot resolution)

    Each is very similar to the character type it is named for: standard
  has greater resolution, but fewer color selections. On the other hand,
  multi-color bit mapping trades horizontal resolution for a greater number
  of colors in an 8-dot by 8-dot square.

  STANDARD HIGH-RESOLUTION BIT MAP MODE

    Standard bit map mode gives you a 320 horizontal dot by 200 vertical
  dot resolution, with a choice of 2 colors in each 8-dot by 8-dot section.
  Bit map mode is selected (turned ON) by setting bit 5 of the VIC-II
  control register to a 1 at location 53265 ($D011 in HEX). The following
  POKE will do this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)OR 32

    Bit map mode is turned OFF by setting bit 5 of the VIC-II control
  register to 0 at location 53265 ($D011), like this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND 223

    Before we get into the details of the bit map mode, there is one more
  issue to tackle, and that is where to locate the bit map area.

  HOW IT WORKS

    If you remember the PROGRAMMABLE CHARACTERS section you will recall
  that you were able to set the bit pattern of a character stored in RAM to
  almost anything you wanted. If at the same time you change the character
  that is displayed on the screen, you would be able to change a single
  dot, and watch it happen. This is the basis of bit-mapping. The entire
  screen is filled with programmable characters, and you make your changes
  directly into the memory that the programmable characters get their
  patterns from.
    Each of the locations in screen memory that were used to control what
  character was displayed, are now used for color information. For example,
  instead of POKEing a I in location 1024 to make an 'A' appear in the top
  left hand corner of the screen, location 1024 now controls the colors of
  the bits in that top left space.
    Colors of squares in bit map mode do not come from color memory, as
  they do in the character modes. Instead, colors are taken from screen
  memory. The upper 4 bits of screen memory become the color of any bit
  that is set to 1 in the 8 by 8 area controlled by that screen memory
  location. The lower 4 bits become the color of any bit that is set to
  a 0.

  EXAMPLE: Type the following:

  5 BASE=2*4096:POKE53272,PEEK(53272)OR8:REM PUT BIT MAP AT 8192
  10 POKE53265,PEEK(53265)OR32:REM ENTER BIT MAP MODE

  Now RUN the program.
    Garbage appears on the screen, right? Just like the normal screen mode,
  you have to clear the HIGH-RESOLUTION (HI-RES) screen before you use it.
  Unfortunately, printing a CLR won't work in this case. Instead you have
  to clear out the section of memory that you're using for your
  programmable characters. Hit the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys, then add
  the following lines to your program to clear the HI-RES screen:

  20 FORI=BASETOBASE+7999:POKEI,0:NEXT:REM CLEAR BIT
  30 FORI=1024TO2023:POKEI,3:NEXT:REM SET COLOR TO CYAN AND BLACK

    Now RUN the program again. You should see the screen clearing, then the
  greenish blue color, cyan, should cover the whole screen. What we want to
  do now is to turn the dots on and off on the HI-RES screen.

    To SET a dot (turn a dot ON) or UNSET a dot (turn a dot OFF) you must
  know how to find the correct bit in the character memory that you have to
  set to a 1. In other words, you have to find the character you need to
  change, the row of the character, and which bit of the row that you
  have to change. You need a formula to calculate this.
    We will use X and Y to stand for the horizontal and vertical positions
  of a dot, The dot where X=0 and Y=0 is at the upper-left of the display.
  Dots to the right have higher X values, and the dots toward the bottom
  have higher Y values."
"In the context of the C64, What feature of the VIC-II chip allows sprites to be expanded in size?","EXPANDED SPRITES

    The VIC-II chip has the ability to expand a sprite in the vertical
  direction, the horizontal direction, or both at once. When expanded, each
  dot in the sprite is twice as wide or twice as tall. Resolution doesn't
  actually increase... the sprite just gets bigger."

"In the context of the C64, How are sprites in memory?","sprite MEMORY ACCESS

    The data for each sprite is Stored in 63 consecutive bytes of memory. Each
  block of sprite data is defined by a sprite pointer, located at the end of the
  VIDEO MATRIX. Only 1000 bytes of the video matrix are used in the normal
  display modes, allowing the video matrix locations 1016-1023 (VM base+
  $3F8 to VM base+$3FF) to be used for sprite pointers 0-7, respectively. The
  eight-bit sprite pointer from the video matrix together with the six bits
  from the sprite byte counter (to address 63 bytes) define the entire 14-bit
  address field:


     A13| A12| A11| A10| A09| A08| A07| A06| A05| A04| A03| A02| A01| A00
     MP7| MP6| MP5| MP4| MP3| MP2| MP1| MP0| MC5| MC4| MC3| MC2| MC1| MC0

  Where MPx are the sprite pointer bits from the video matrix and MCx are the
  internally generated sprite counter bits. The sprite pointers are read from the
  video matrix at the end of every raster line. When the Y position
  register of a sprite matches the current raster line count, the actual
  fetches of sprite data begin. Internal counters automatically step through
  the 63 bytes of sprite data, displaying three bytes on each raster line."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the 6566/6567 in the character display mode?","CHARACTER DISPLAY MODE

    In the character display mode, the 6566/6567 fetches CHARACTER POINTERs
  from the VIDEO MATRIX area of memory and translates the pointers to
  character dot location addresses in the 2048 byte CHARACTER BASE area of
  memory. The video matrix is comprised of 1000 consecutive locations in
  memory which each contain an eight-bit character pointer. The location of
  the video matrix within memory is defined by VM13-VM10 in register 24
  ($18) which are used as the 4 MSB of the video matrix address. The lower
  order 10 bits are provided by an internal counter (VC9-VC0) which steps
  through the 1000 character locations. Note that the 6566/6567 provides 14
  address outputs; therefore, additional system hardware may be required
  for complete system memory decodes.

    VM13|VM12|VM11|VM10| VC9| VC8| VC7| VC6| VC5| VC4| VC3| VC2| VC1| VC0


    The eight-bit character pointer permits up to 256 different character
  definitions to be available simultaneously. Each character is an 8*8 dot
  matrix stored in the character base as eight consecutive bytes. The loca-
  tion of the character base is defined by CB13-CB11 also in register 24
  ($18) which are used for the 3 most significant bits (MSB) of the char-
  acter base address. The 11 lower order addresses are formed by the 8-bit
  character pointer from the video matrix (D7-D0) which selects a
  particular character, and a 3-bit raster counter (RC2-RC0) which selects
  one of the eight character bytes. The resulting characters are formatted
  as 25 rows of 40 characters each. In addition to the 8-bit character
  pointer, a 4-bit COLOR NYBBLE is associated with each video matrix
  location (the video matrix memory must be 12 bits wide) which defines one
  of sixteen colors for each character.

  STANDARD CHARACTER MODE (MCM = BMM = ECM = 0)

    In the standard character mode, the 8 sequential bytes from the
  character base are displayed directly on the 8 lines in each character
  region. A '0' bit causes the background #0 color (from register 33 ($21))
  to be displayed while the color selected by the color nybble (foreground)
  is displayed for a '1' bit (see Color Code Table).

                | CHARACTER |

          transmitting data."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary function of the serial bus in the Commodore 64?","THE SERIAL BUS

    The serial bus is a daisy chain arrangement designed to let the Com-
  modore 64 communicate with devices such as the VIC-1541 DISK DRIVE and
  the VIC-1525 GRAPHICS PRINTER. The advantage of the serial bus is that
  more than one device can be connected to the port. Up to 5 devices can be
  connected to the serial bus at one time.
    There are three types of operation over a serial bus-CONTROL, TALK, and
  LISTEN. A CONTROLLER device is one which controls operation of the serial
  bus. A TALKER transmits data onto the bus. A LISTENER receives data from
  the bus.
    The Commodore 64 is the controller of the bus. It also acts as a TALKER
  (when sending data to the printer, for example) and as a LISTENER (when
  loading a program from the disk drive, for example). Other devices may be
  either LISTENERS (the printer), TALKERS, or both (the disk drive). Only
  the Commodore 64 can act as the controller.
    All devices connected on the serial bus will receive all the data
  transmitted over the bus. To allow the Commodore 64 to route data to its
  intended destination, each device has a bus ADDRESS. By using this device
  address, the Commodore 64 can control access to the bus. Addresses on the
  serial bus range from 4 to 31.
    The Commodore 64 can COMMAND a particular device to TALK or LISTEN.
  When the Commodore 64 commands a device to TALK, the device will begin
  putting data onto the serial bus. When the Commodore 64 commands a device
  to LISTEN, the device addressed will get ready to receive data (from the
  Commodore 64 or from another device on the bus). Only one device can TALK
  on the bus at a time; otherwise, the data will collide and the system
  will crash in confusion. However, any number of devices can LISTEN at the
  same time to one TALKER.

                         COMMON SERIAL BUS ADDRESSES
                    +--------+--------------------------+
                    | NUMBER |        DEVICE            |

                    +--------+--------------------------+

    Other device addresses are possible. Each device has its own address.
  Certain devices (like the Commodore 64 printer) provide a choice between
  two addresses for the convenience of the user.
    The SECONDARY ADDRESS is to let the Commodore 64 transmit setup
  information to a device. For example, to OPEN a connection on the bus to
  the printer, and have it print in UPPER/LOWER case, use the following

    OPEN 1,4,7

  where,
    1 is the logical file number (the number you PRINT# to),
    4 is the ADDRESS of the printer, and
    7 is the SECONDARY ADDRESS that tells the printer to go into UPPER/
      LOWER case mode.

    There are 6 lines used in serial bus operations - input and 3 output.
  The 3 input lines bring data, control, and timing signals into the Com-
  modore 64. The 3 output lines send data, control, and timing signals from
  the Commodore 64 to external devices on the serial bus.

"In the context of the C64, Describe how sprite priority works","PRIORITY

    The priority of each sprite may be individually controlled with respect to
  the other displayed information from character or bit map modes. The
  priority of each sprite is set by the corresponding bit (MnDP) of register
  27 ($1B) as follows:

     REG BIT  |          PRIORITY TO CHARACTER OR BIT MAP DATA
        0     |  Non-transparent sprite data will be displayed (sprite in front)
        1     |  Non-transparent sprite data will be displayed only instead of

  sprite data bits of '0' ('00' in multi-color mode) are transparent, always
  permitting any other information to be displayed.
    The sprites have a fixed priority with respect to each other, with sprite 0
  having the highest priority and sprite 7 the lowest. When sprite data (except
  transparent data) of two sprites are coincident, the data from the lower
  number sprite will be displayed. sprite vs. sprite data is prioritized before
  priority resolution with character or bit map data."

  sprite. However, just like other multi-color modes, horizontal resolution
  is cut in half. In other words, when you're working with sprite multi-
  color mode (like in multi-color character mode), instead of 24 dots
  across the sprite, there are 12 pairs of dots. Each pair of dots is
  called a BIT PAIR. Think of each bit pair (pair of dots) as a single dot
  in your overall sprite when it comes to choosing colors for the dots in
  your sprites. The table below gives you the bit pair values needed to
  turn ON each of the four colors you've chosen for your sprite:

"In the context of the C64, What is the recommended resistance for the source resistor from the AUDIO OUT to ground for proper operation?","AUDIO OUT (Pin 27)

    This open-source buffer is the final audio output of SID, comprised of
  the three SID voices, the Filter and any external input. The output level
  is set by the output Volume control and reaches a maximum of 2 volts p-p
  at a DC level of 6 volts. A source resistor from AUDIO OUT to ground is
  required for proper operation. The recommended resistance is 1 kohm for
  a standard output impedance.
    As the output of SID rides at a 6-volt DC level, it should be AC-
  coupled to any audio amplifier with an electrolytic capacitor in the 1-10
  uF range.

  VDD (Pin 28)

    As with Vcc, a separate +12 VDC line should be run to SID VDD and a
  bypass capacitor should be used.

"In the context of the C64, how do I set multi color mode on a sprite?","SETTING A SPRITE TO MULTI-COLOR MODE

    To switch a sprite into multi-color mode you must turn ON the VIC-II

"In the context of the C64, What is the primary method used to achieve high-resolution displays on the Commodore 64?","BIT MAPPED GRAPHICS

When writing games, plotting charts for business applications, or other types of programs, sooner or later you get to the point where you want
high-resolution displays.

The Commodore 64 has been designed to do just that: high resolution is available through bit mapping of the screen. Bit mapping is the method in which each possible dot (pixel) of resolution on the screen is assigned its own bit (location) in memory. If that memory bit is a one, the dot it is assigned to is on. If the bit is set to zero, the dot is off.
  
High-resolution graphic design has a couple of drawbacks, which is why it is not used all the time. First of all, it takes lots of memory to bit map the entire screen. This is because every pixel must have a memory bit to control it. You are going to need one bit of memory for each pixel (or one byte for 8 pixels). Since each character is 8 by 8, and there are 40 lines with 25 characters in each line, the resolution is 320 pixels (dots) by 200 pixels for the whole screen. That gives you 64000 separate dots, each of which requires a bit in memory. In other words, 8000 bytes of memory are needed to map the whole screen.

Generally, high-resolution operations are made of many short, simple, repetitive routines. Unfortunately, this kind of thing is usually rather slow if you are trying to write high-resolution routines in BASIC. How-ever, short, simple, repetitive routines are exactly what machine language does best. The solution is to either write your programs entirely in machine language, or call machine language, high-resolution sub-xroutines from your BASIC program using the SYS command from BASIC. That way you get both the ease of writing in BASIC, and the speed of machine language for graphics. The VSP cartridge is also available to add high-resolution commands to COMMODORE 64 BASIC.
  
All of the examples given in this section will be in BASIC to make themclear. Now to the technical details."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the JSR instruction in the C64 machine language program?","SUBROUTINES

    In machine language (in the same way as using BASIC), you can call
  subroutines. The instruction to call a subroutine is JSR (Jump to Sub-
  Routine), followed by the specified absolute address.
    Incorporated in the operating system, there is a machine language
  subroutine that will PRINT a character to the screen. The CBM ASCII code
  of the character should be in the accumulator before calling the
  subroutine. The address of this subroutine is $FFD2.
    Therefore, to print 'Hi' to the screen, the following program should be
  entered:

    .A 1400 LDA #$48     - load the CBM ASCII code of 'H'
    .A 1402 JSR $FFD2    -  print it
    .A 1405 LDA #$49     - load the CBM ASCII code of 'I'
    .A 1407 JSR $FFD2    -  print that too
    .A 140A LDA #$0D     - print a carriage return as well
    .A 140C JSR $FFD2
    .A 140F BRK          - return to 64MON
    .G 1400              - will print 'HI' and return to 64MON"

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the COLLISION DETECTION system in a sprite-based graphics system?","COLLISION DETECTION


    Two types of sprite collision (coincidence) are detected, sprite to sprite
  collision and sprite to display data collision:


    1) A collision between two sprites occurs when non-transparent output data
       of two sprites are coincident. Coincidence of sprite transparent areas
       will not generate a collision. When a collision occurs, the sprite bits
       (MnM) in the sprite-sprite COLLISION register 30 ($1E) will be set to '1'
       for both colliding spriteS. As a collision between two (or more) sprites
       occurs, the sprite-sprite collision bit for each collided sprite will be set.
       The collision bits remain set until a read of the collision
       register, when all bits are automatically cleared. sprites collisions
       are detected even if positioned off-screen.
    2) The second type of collision is a sprite-DATA collision between a sprite
       and foreground display data from the character or bit map modes. The
       sprite-DATA COLLISION register 31 ($1F) has a 'bit (MnD) for each sprite
       which is set to '1' when both the sprite and non-background display
       data are coincident. Again, the coincidence of only transparent data
       does not generate a collision. For special applications, the display
       data from the 0-1 multicolor bit pair also does not cause a
       collision. This feature permits their use as background display data
       without interfering with true sprite collisions. A sprite-DATA collision
       can occur off-screen in the horizontal direction if actual display
       data has been scrolled to an off-screen position (see scrolling).
       The sprite-DATA COLLISION register also automatically clears when read.
    The collision interrupt latches are set whenever the first bit of
   either register is set to '1'. Once any collision bit within a register
   is set high, subsequent collisions will not set the interrupt latch
   until that collision register has been cleared to all '0s' by a read."
"In the context of the C64, What are the ASCII and CHR$ codes?","ASCII AND CHR$ CODES

    This appendix shows you what characters will appear if you PRINT
  CHR$(X), for all possible values of X. It will also show the values ob-
  tained by typing PRINT ASC('x'), where x is any character you can type.
  This is useful in evaluating the character received in a GET statement,
  converting upper/lower case, and printing character based commands (like
  switch to upper/lower case) that could not be enclosed in quotes.

    In bit map mode, the 6566/6567 fetches data from memory in a different
  fashion, so that a one-to-one correspondence exists between each
  displayed dot and a memory bit. The bit map mode provides a screen
  resolution of 320H * 200V individually controlled display dots. Bit map
  mode is selected by setting the BMM bit in register 17 ($11) to a '1'.

  matrix data is no longer interpreted as character pointers, but rather as
  color data. The VIDEO MATRIX COUNTER is then also used as an address to
  fetch the dot data for display from the 8000-byte DISPLAY BASE. The
  display base address is formed as follows:

"In the context of the C64, how do I turn a sprite On ?","TURNING SPRITES ON

    The VIC-II control register at location 53269 ($D015 in HEX) is known
  as the SPRITE ENABLE register. Each of the sprites has a bit in this
  register which controls whether that sprite is ON or OFF. The register
  looks like this:

                     $D015  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

    To turn on sprite 1, for example, it is necessary to turn that bit to
  a 1. The following POKE does this:

    POKE 53269.PEEK(53269)OR 2

  A more general statement would be the following:

    POKE 53269,PEEK(53269)OR (2^SN)

  where SN is the sprite number, from 0 to 7.

   NOTE: A sprite must be turned ON before it can be seen."
"In the context of the C64, What is the command that turns on the Extended color mode in the VIC-II register?","Extended color mode is turned ON by setting bit 6 of the VIC-II regis-ter to a 1 at location 53265 ($D011 in HEX). The following POKE does it:

"In the context of the C64, What are the primary functions of the D0-D7 pins in the SID and microprocessor?","D0-D7 (Pins 15-22)

    These bidirectional lines are used to transfer data between SID and the
  microprocessor. They are TTL compatible in the input mode and capable of
  driving 2 TTL loads in the output mode. The data buffers are usually in
  the high-impedance off state. During a Write operation, the data buffers
  remain in the off (input) state and the microprocessor supplies data to
  SID over these lines. During a Read operation, the data buffers turn on
  and SID supplies data to the microprocessor over these lines. The pins
  are normally connected to the corresponding data lines of the micro-
  processor.

  POTX,POTY (Pins 24,23)

    These pins are inputs to the A/D converters used to digitize the posi-
  tion of potentiometers. The conversion process is based on the time con-
  stant of a capacitor tied from the POT pin to ground, charged by a
  potentiometer tied from the POT pin to +5 volts. The component values are
  determined by:

                                RC = 4.7E-4

  Where R is the maximum resistance of the pot and C is the capacitor.
    The larger the capacitor, the smaller the POT value jitter. The recom-
  mended values for R and C are 470 komhs and 1000 pF. Note that a separate
  pot and cap are required for each POT pin."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary limitation of using extended background color mode in terms of character display?","EXTENDED BACKGROUND COLOR MODE

Extended background color mode gives you control over the background color of each individual character, as well as over the foreground color.
For example, in this mode you could display a blue character with ayellow background on a white screen.
There are 4 registers available for extended background color mode.
Each of the registers can be set to any of the 16 colors.
Color memory is used to hold the foreground color in extended back-ground mode. It is used the same as in standard character mode.
Extended character mode places a limit on the number of different characters you can display, however. When extended color mode is on, only the first 64 characters in the character ROM (or the first 64 characters in your programmable character set) can be used. This is because two of the bits of the character code are used to select the background color.
It might work something like this:

The character code (the number you would POKE to the screen) of the letter 'A' is a 1. When extended color mode is on, if you POKED a 1 to the screen, an 'A' would appear. If you POKED a 65 to the screen normally, you would expect the character with character code (CHR$) 129 to appear, which is a reversed 'A.' This does NOT happen in extended color mode. Instead you get the same unreversed 'A' as before, but on a different background color."
"In the context of the C64, What is the formula for calculating the start of the 64 bytes of the sprite definition block?","If sprite pointer #0, at location 2040, contains the number 14, for
  example, this means that sprite 0 will be displayed using the 64 bytes
  beginning at location 14*64 = 896 which is in the cassette buffer. The
  following formula makes this clear:

    LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE POINTER VALUE * 64)

  Where BANK is the 16K segment of memory that the VIC-II chip is looking
  at and is from 0 to 3.
    The above formula gives the start of the 64 bytes of the sprite
  definition block.
    When the VIC-II chip is looking at BANK 0 or BANK 2, there is a ROM
  IMAGE of the character set present in certain locations, as mentioned
  before. Sprite definitions can NOT be placed there. If for some reason
  you need more than 128 different sprite definitions, you should use one
  of the banks without the ROM IMAGE, 1 or 3."
"In the context of the C64, how can I create a smooth scrolling with the VIC-II chip on C64?","SMOOTH SCROLLING

    The VIC-II chip supports smooth scrolling in both the horizontal and
  vertical directions. Smooth scrolling is a one pixel movement of the
  entire screen in one direction. It can move either UP, or down, or left,
  or right. It is used to move new information smoothly onto the screen,
  while smoothly removing characters from the other side.
    While the VIC-II chip does much of the task for you, the actual scroll-
  ing must be done by a machine language program. The VIC-II chip features
  the ability to place the video screen in any of 8 horizontal positions,
  and 8 vertical positions. Positioning is controlled by the VIC-II
  scrolling registers. The VIC-II chip also has a 38 column mode, and a 24
  row mode. the smaller screen sizes are used to give you a place for your
  new data to scroll on from.

  The following are the steps for SMOOTH SCROLLING:
  1) Shrink the screen (the border will expand).
  2) Set the scrolling register to maximum (or minimum value depending upon
     the direction of your scroll).
  3) Place the new data on the proper (covered) portion of the screen.
  4) Increment (or decrement) the scrolling register until it reaches the
     maximum (or minimum) value.
  5) At this point, use your machine language routine to shift the entire
     screen one entire character in the direction of the scroll.
  6) Go back to step 2.

    To go into 38 column mode, bit 3 of location 53270 ($D016) must be set
  to a 0. The following POKE does this:

    POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND 247

    To return to 40 column mode, set bit 3 of location 53270 ($D016) to a
  1.The following POKE does this:

    POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 8

    To go into 24 row mode, bit 3 of location 53265 ($D011) must be set to
  a 0. The following POKE will do this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND 247

    To return to 25 row mode, set bit 3 of location 53265 ($D011) to a 1.
  The following POKE does this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)OR 8

    When scrolling in the X direction, it is necessary to place the VIC-II
  chip into 38 column mode. This gives new data a place to scroll from.
  When scrolling LEFT, the new data should be placed on the right. When
  scrolling RIGHT the new data should be placed on the left. Please note
  that there are still 40 columns to screen memory, but only 38 are
  visible.
    When scrolling in the Y direction, it is necessary to place the VIC-II
  chip into 24 row mode. When scrolling UP, place the new data in the LAST
  row. When scrolling DOWN, place the new data on the FIRST row. Unlike X
  scrolling, where there are covered areas on each side of the screen,
  there is only one covered area in Y scrolling. When the Y scrolling
  register is set to 0, the first line is covered, ready for new data. When
  the Y scrolling register is set to 7 the last row is covered.
    For scrolling in the X direction, the scroll register is located in
  bits 2 to 0 of the VIC-II control register at location 53270 ($D016 in
  HEX). As always, it is important to affect only those bits. The following
  POKE does this:

    POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND 248)+X

  where X is the X position of the screen from 0 to 7.
    For scrolling in the Y direction, the scroll register is located in
  bits 2 to 0 of the VIC-II control register at location 53265 ($D011 in
  HEX). As always, it is important to affect only those bits. The following
  POKE does this:

    POKE 53265,(PEEK(53265)AND 248)+Y

  where Y is the Y position of the screen from 0 to 7.
    To scroll text onto the screen from the bottom, you would step the low-
  order 3 bits of location 53265 from 0-7, put more data on the covered
  line at the bottom of the screen, and then repeat the process. To scroll
  characters onto the screen from left to right, you would step the low-
  order 3 bits of location 53270 from 0 to 7, print or POKE another column
  of new data into column 0 of the screen, then repeat the process.
    If you step the scroll bits by -1, your text will move in the opposite
  direction."

"In the context of the C64, What is the extended color mode?","EXTENDED COLOR MODE (ECM = 1, Bmm = MCM = 0)

    The extended color mode allows the selection of individual, background
  colors for each character region with the normal 8*8 character
  resolution. This mode is selected by setting the ECM bit of register 17
  ($11) to '1'. The character dot data is displayed as in the standard mode
  (foreground color determined by the color nybble is displayed for a '1'

  data bit), but the 2 MSB of the character pointer are used to select the

           11         |  Background #3 color (register 36 ($24))

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the Commodore CP/M cartridge?","Z-80 MICROPROCESSOR CARTRIDGE

  Peripherals are things like Datassette(TM) recorders, disk
  drives, printers, and modems. All these items can be added to your
  Commodore 64 through the various ports and sockets on the back of your
  machine. The thing that makes Commodore peripherals so good is the fact
  that our peripherals are 'intelligent.' That means that they don't take
  up valuable Random Access Memory space when they're in use. You're free
  to use all 64K of memory in your Commodore 64.
    Another advantage of your Commodore 64 is the fact most programs you
  write on your Commodore 64 today will be upwardly compatible with any new
  Commodore computer you buy in the future. This is partially because of
  the qualities of the computer's Operating System (OS).
    However, there is one thing that the Commodore OS can't do: make your
  programs compatible with a computer made by another company.
    Most of the time you won't even have to think about using another com-
  pany's computer, because your Commodore 64 is so easy to use. But for the
  occasional user who wants to take advantage of software that may not be
  available in Commodore 64 format we have created a Commodore CP/M(R)
  cartridge.
    CP/M(R) is not a 'computer dependent' operating system. Instead it uses
  some of the memory space normally available for programming to run its
  own operating system. There are advantages and disadvantages to this. The
  disadvantages are that the programs you write will have to be shorter
  than the programs you can write using the Commodore 64's built-in
  operating system. In addition, you can NOT use the Commodore 64's
  powerful screen editing capabilities. The advantages are that you can now
  use a large amount of software that has been specifically designed for
  CP/M(R) and the Z-80 microprocessor, and the programs that you write
  using the CP/M(R) operating system can be transported and run on any
  other computer that has CP/M(R) and a Z-80 card.
    By the way, most computers that have a Z-80 microprocessor require that
  you go inside the computer to actually install a Z-80 card. With this
  method you have to be very careful not to disturb the delicate circuitry
  that runs the rest of the computer. The Commodore CP/M& cartridge
  eliminates this hassle because our Z-80 cartridge plugs into the back of
  your Commodore 64 quickly and easily, without any messy wires that can
  cause problems later."

"In the context of the C64, Describe how color works for sprites","COLOR

    Each sprite has a separate 4-bit register to determine the sprite color. The
  two sprite color modes are:

  STANDARD sprite (MnMC = 0)

    In the standard mode, a '0' bit of sprite data allows any background data
  to show through (transparent) and a '1' bit is displayed as the sprite color
  determined by the corresponding sprite Color register.

  MULTI-COLOR sprite (MnMC = 1)

    Each sprite can be individually selected as a multi-color sprite via MnMC
  bits in the sprite Multi-color register 28 ($1C). When the MnMC bit is '1',
  the corresponding sprite is displayed in the multi-color mode. In the multi-
  color mode, the sprite data is interpreted in pairs (similar to the other
  multi-color modes) as follows:

        BIT PAIR      |                   COLOR DISPLAYED
           00         |  Transparent

           11         |  sprite Multi-color #1 (register 38 ($26))


  Since two bits of data are required for each color, the resolution of the
  sprite is reduced to 12X21, with each horizontal dot expanded to twice
  standard size so that the overall sprite size does not change. Note that up
  to 3 colors can be displayed in each sprite (in addition to transparent) but
  that two of the colors are shared among all the sprites in the multi-color
  mode."

  VIC-II chip. And all you have to do is tell a sprite 'what to look like,'
  'what color to be,' and 'where to appear.' The VIC-II chip will do the
  rest! Sprites can be any of the 16 colors available.
    Sprites can be used with ANY of the other graphics modes, bit mapped,
  character, multi-color, etc., and they'll keep their shape in all of
  them. The sprite carries its own color definition, its own mode (HI-RES
  or multi-colored), and its own shape.
    Up to 8 sprites at a time can be maintained by the VIC-II chip auto-
  matically. More sprites can be displayed using RASTER INTERRUPT
  techniques.

    The features of SPRITES include:

    1) 24 horizontal dot by 21 vertical dot size.
    2) Individual color control for each sprite.
    3) Sprite multi-color mode.
    4) Magnification (2x) in horizontal, vertical, or both directions.
    5) Selectable sprite to background priority.
    6) Fixed sprite to sprite priorities.
    7) Sprite to sprite collision detection.
    8) Sprite to background collision detection."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary function of the OSC 3 register ?","OSC 3/RANDOM (Register $1B)

    This register allows the microprocessor to read the upper 8 output bits
  of Oscillator 3. The character of the numbers generated is directly re-
  lated to the waveform selected. If the Sawtooth waveform of Oscillator 3
  is selected, this register will present a series of numbers incrementing
  from 0 to 255 ($FF) at a rate determined by the frequency of Oscillator
  3. If the Triangle waveform is selected, the output will increment from 0
  up to 255, then decrement down to 0. If the Pulse waveform is selected,
  the output will jump between 0 and 255. Selecting the Noise waveform
  will produce a series of random numbers, therefore, this register can be
  used as a random number generator for games. There are numerous timing
  and sequencing applications for the OSC 3 register, however, the chief
  function is probably that of a modulation generator. The numbers
  generated by this register can be added, via software, to the Oscillator
  or Filter Frequency registers or the Pulse Width registers in real-time.
  Many dynamic effects can be generated in this manner. Siren-like sounds
  can be created by adding the OSC 3 Sawtooth output to the frequency
  control of another oscillator. Synthesizer 'Sample and Hold' effects can
  be produced by adding the OSC 3 Noise output to the Filter Frequency
  control registers. Vibrato can be produced by setting Oscillator 3 to a
  frequency around 7 Hz and adding the OSC 3 Triangle output (with proper
  scaling) to the Frequency control of another oscillator. An unlimited
  range of effects are available by altering the frequency of Oscillator 3
  and scaling the OSC 3 output. Normally, when Oscillator 3 is used for
  modulation, the audio output of Voice 3 should be eliminated (3 OFF = 1)."
"In the context of the C64, What is the SID CONTROL REGISTER (Register 04)?","CONTROL REGISTER (Register 04)

    This register contains eight control bits which select various options
  on Oscillator 1.
    GATE (Bit 0): The GATE bit controls the Envelope Generator for Voice 1.
  When this bit is set to a one, the Envelope Generator is Gated
  (triggered) and the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle is initiated. When the bit
  is reset to a zero, the RELEASE cycle begins. The Envelope Generator
  controls the amplitude of Oscillator I appearing at the audio output,
  therefore, the GATE bit must be set (along with suitable envelope pa-
  rameters) for the selected output of Oscillator 1 to be audible. A de-
  tailed discussion of the Envelope Generator can be found at the end of
  this Appendix.
    SYNC (Bit 1): The SYNC bit, when set to a one, synchronizes the
  fundamental frequency of Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of
  Oscillator 3, producing 'Hard Sync' effects.
    Varying the frequency of Oscillator 1 with respect to Oscillator 3 pro-
  duces a wide range of complex harmonic structures from Voice I at the
  frequency of Oscillator 3. In order for sync to occur, Oscillator 3 must
  be set to some frequency other than zero but preferably lower than the
  frequency of Oscillator 1. No other parameters of Voice 3 have any effect
  on sync.
    RING MOD (Bit 2): The RING MOD bit, when set to a one, replaces the
  Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1 with a 'Ring Modulated'
  combination of Oscillators 1 and 3. Varying the frequency of Oscillator 1
  with respect to Oscillator 3 produces a wide range of non-harmonic
  overtone structures for creating bell or gong sounds and for special ef-
  fects. In order for ring modulation to be audible, the Triangle waveform
  of Oscillator 1 must be selected and Oscillator 3 must be set to some
  frequency other than zero. No other parameters of Voice 3 have any effect
  on ring modulation.
    TEST (Bit 3): The TEST bit, when set to a one, resets and locks Oscil-
  lator 1 at zero until the TEST bit is cleared. The Noise waveform output
  of Oscillator 1 is also reset and the Pulse waveform output is held at a
  DC level. Normally this bit is used for testing purposes, however, it can
  be used to synchronize Oscillator 1 to external events, allowing the
  generation of highly complex waveforms under real-time software control.
  (Bit 4): When set to a one, the Triangle waveform output of Oscillator
  1 is selected. The Triangle waveform is low in harmonics and has a
  mellow, flute-like quality.
    (Bit 5): When set to a one, the Sawtooth waveform output of Oscillator
  1 is selected. The Sawtooth waveform is rich in even and odd harmonics
  and has a bright, brassy quality.
    (Bit 6): When set to a one, the Pulse waveform output of Oscillator 1
  is selected. The harmonic content of this waveform can be adjusted by the
  Pulse Width registers, producing tone qualities ranging from a bright,
  hollow square wave to a nasal, reedy pulse. Sweeping the pulse width in
  real-time produces a dynamic 'phasing' effect which adds a sense of
  motion to the sound. Rapidly jumping between different pulse widths can
  produce interesting harmonic sequences.
    NOISE (Bit 7): When set to a one, the Noise output waveform of
  Oscillator 1 is selected. This output is a random signal which changes at
  the frequency of Oscillator 1. The sound quality can be varied from a low
  rumbling to hissing white noise via the Oscillator 1 Frequency registers.
  Noise is useful in creating explosions, gunshots, jet engines, wind, surf
  and other unpitched sounds, as well as snore drums and cymbals. Sweeping
  the oscillator frequency with Noise selected produces a dramatic rushing
  effect.
    One of the output waveforms must be selected for Oscillator 1 to be
  audible, however, it is NOT necessary to de-select waveforms to silence
  the output of Voice 1. The amplitude of Voice 1 at the final output is a
  function of the Envelope Generator only.


  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | NOTE: The oscillator output waveforms are NOT additive. If more than  |
  | one output waveform is selected simultaneously, the result will be a  |
  | logical ANDing of the waveforms. Although this technique can be used  |
  | to generate additional waveforms beyond the four listed above, it must|
  | be used with care. If any other waveform is selected while Noise is   |
  | on, the Noise output can 'lock up ' If this occurs, the Noise output  |
  | will remain silent until reset by the TEST bit or by bringing RES     |
  | (pin 5) low.                                                          |

  24*21 array (12X21 if multi-colored) is displayed, but the overall sprite
  dimension is doubled in the desired direction (the smallest sprite dot may

  two colors to be independently selected in each 8*8 dot block. When a bit
  in the display memory is a '0' the color of the output dot is set by the
  least significant (lower) nybble (LSN). Similarly, a display memory bit
  of '1' selects the output color determined by the MSN (upper nybble).

  attention from the Commodore 64. The Commodore 64 will then take care of
  the device. (See Figure 6-4)."
"In the context of the C64, describe the 6526 Interrupt Control Register?","Interrupt Control (ICR)

    There are five sources of interrupts on the 6526: underflow from TIMER
  A, underflow from TIMER B, TOD ALARM, Serial Port full/empty and /FLAG.
  A single register provides masking and interrupt information. The
  interrupt Control Register consists of a write-only MASK register and a
  read-only DATA register. Any interrupt will set the corresponding bit in
  the DATA register. Any interrupt which is enabled by the MASK register
  will set the IR bit (MSB) of the DATA register and bring the /IRQ pin
  low. In a multi-chip system, the IR bit can be polled to detect which
  chip has generated an interrupt request. The interrupt DATA register is
  cleared and the /IRQ line returns high following a read of the DATA
  register. Since each interrupt sets an interrupt bit regardless of the
  MASK, and each interrupt bit can be selectively masked to prevent the
  generation of a processor interrupt, it is possible to intermix polled
  interrupts with true interrupts. However, polling the IR bit will cause
  the DATA register to clear, therefore, it is up to the user to preserve
  the information contained in the DATA register if any polled interrupts
  were present.
    The MASK register provides convenient control of individual mask bits.
  When writing to the MASK register, if bit 7 (SET/CLEAR) of the data
written is a ZERO, any mask bit written with a one will be cleared, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. If bit 7 of the
  data written is a ONE, any mask bit written with a one will be set, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. In order for an
  interrupt flag to set IR and generate an Interrupt Request, the corre-
  sponding MASK bit must be set."

"In the context of the C64, What is the 6526 handshaking?","6256 Handshaking

    Handshaking on data transfers can be accomplished using the /PC output
  pin and the FLAG input pin. PC will go low for one cycle following a read
  or write of PORT B. This signal can be used to indicate 'data ready' at
  PORT B or 'data accepted' from PORT B. Handshaking on 16-bit data
  transfers (using both PORT A and PORT B) is possible by always reading or
  writing PORT A first. /FLAG is a negative edge sensitive input which can
  be used for receiving the /PC output from another 6526, or as a general
  purpose interrupt input. Any negative transition of /FLAG will set the
  /FLAG interrupt bit.


  Interval Timers (Timer A, Timer B)

    Each interval timer consists of a 16-bit read-only Timer Counter and a
  16-bit write-only Timer Latch. Data written to the timer are latched in
  the Timer Latch, while data read from the timer are the present contents
  of the Time Counter. The timers can be used independently or linked for
  extended operations. The various timer modes allow generation of long
  time delays, variable width pulses, pulse trains and variable frequency
  waveforms. Utilizing the CNT input, the timers can count external pulses
  or measure frequency, pulse width and delay times of external signals.
  Each timer has an associated control register, providing independent
  control of the following functions:

  Start/Stop

    A control bit allows the timer to be started or stopped by the micro-
  processor at any time.

  PB On/Off:

    A control bit allows the timer output to appear on a PORT B output line
  (PB6 for TIMER A and PB7 for TIMER B). This function overrides the DDRB
  control bit and forces the appropriate PB line to an output.

  Toggle/Pulse

    A control bit selects the output applied to PORT B. On every timer
  underflow the output can either toggle or generate a single positive
  pulse of one cycle duration. The Toggle output is set high whenever the
  timer is started and is set low by /RES.

  One-Shot/Continuous

    A control bit selects either timer mode. In one-shot mode, the timer
  will count down from the latched value to zero, generate an interrupt,
  reload the latched value, then stop. In continuous mode, the timer will
  count from the latched value to zero, generate' an interrupt, reload the
  latched value and repeat the procedure continuously.

  Force Load

    A strobe bit allows the timer latch to be loaded into the timer counter
  at any time, whether the timer is running or not.

  Input Mode:

    Control bits allow selection of the clock used to decrement the timer.
  TIMER A can count 02 clock pulses or external pulses applied to the CNT
  pin. TIMER B can count (02 pulses, external CNT pulses, TIMER A underflow
  pulses or TIMER A underflow pulses while the CNT pin is held high.

    The timer latch is loaded into the timer on any timer underflow, on a
  force load or following a write to the high byte of the prescaler while
  the timer is stopped. If the timer is running, a write to the high byte
  will load the timer latch, but not reload the counter."

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the stack in the 6510 microprocessor?","THE STACK

    The 6510 microprocessor has what is known as a stack. This is used by
  both the programmer and the microprocessor to temporarily remember
  things, and to remember, for example, an order of events. The GOSUB
  statement in BASIC, which allows the programmer to call a subroutine,
  must remember where it is being called from, so that when the RETURN
  statement is executed in the subroutine, the BASIC interpreter 'knows'
  where to go back to continue executing. When a GOSUB statement is
  encountered in a program by the BASIC interpreter, the BASIC interpreter
  'pushes' its current position onto the stack before going to do the
  subroutine, and when a RETURN is executed, the interpreter 'pulls' off
  the stack the information that tells it where it was before the
  subroutine call was made. The interpreter uses instructions like PHA,
  which pushes the contents of the accumulator onto the stack, and PLA (the
  reverse) which pulls a value off the stack and into the accumulator. The
  status register can also be pushed and pulled with the PHP and PLP,
  respectively.

    The stack is 256 bytes long, and is located in page one of memory. It
  is therefore from $01 00 to $01 FF. It is organized backwards in memory.
  In other words, the first position in the stack is at $01 FF, and the
  last is at $0100. Another register in the 651 0 microprocessor is called
  the stack pointer, and it always points to the next available location in
  the stack. When something is pushed onto the stack, it is placed where
  the stack pointer points to, and the stack pointer is moved down to the
  next position (decremented). When something is pulled off the stack, the
  stack pointer is incremented, and the byte pointed to by the stack
  pointer is placed into the specified register.

  The implied mode means that information isimplied by an instruction itself. In other words, what registers, flags,
  and memory the instruction is referring to. The examples we have seen are
  PHA, PLA, PHP, and PLP, which refer to stack processing and the
  accumulator and status registers, respectively.


NOTE: The X register will be referred to as X from now on, and similarly A (accumulator), Y (Y index register), S (stack pointer), and P (processor status).           |"
"In the context of the C64, how do i set the multi color mode?","MULTI-COLOR MODE BIT

    To turn on multi-color character mode, set bit 4 of the VIC-II control
  register at 53270 ($D016) to a 1 by using the following POKE:

    POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16

    To turn off multi-color character mode, set bit 4 of location 53270 to
  a 0 by the following POKE:

    POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND 239

    Multi-color mode is set on or off for each space on the screen, so that
  multi-color graphics can be mixed with high-resolution (hi-res) graphics.
  This is controlled by bit 3 in color memory. Color memory begins at
  location 55296 ($D800 in HEX). If the number in color memory is less than
  8 (0-7) the corresponding space on the video screen will be standard
  hi-res, in the color (0-7) you've chosen. If the number located in color
  memory is greater or equal
 to 8 (from 8 to 15), then that space will be displayed in multi-color mode.

    By POKEing a number into color memory, you can change the color of the
  character in that position on the screen. POKEing a number from 0 to 7
  gives the normal character colors. POKEing a number between 8 and 15 puts
  the space into multi-color mode. In other words, turning BIT 3 ON in
  color memory, sets MULTI-COLOR MODE. Turning BIT 3 OFF in color memory,
  sets the normal, HIGH-RESOLUTION mode.
    Once multi-color mode is set in a space, the bits in the character
  determine which colors are displayed for the dots. 

    In normal or high-resolution mode, the screen color is displayed
  everywhere there is a 0 bit, and the character color is displayed where
  the bit is a 1. Multi-color mode uses the bits in pairs

  The bit pairs determine
  this, according to the following chart:


  BIT PAIR - COLOR REGISTER - LOCATION
  00 - Background #0 color (screen color) - 53281 ($D021) 
  01 - Background #l color - 53282 ($D022)

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the raster register in a display system?","RASTER REGISTER

    The raster register is a dual-function register. A read of the raster
  register 18 ($12) returns the lower 8 bits of the current raster position
  (the MSB-RC8 is located in register 17 ($11)). The raster register can be
  interrogated to implement display changes outside the visible area to
  prevent display flicker. The visible display window is from raster 51
  through raster 251 ($033-$0FB). A write to the raster bits (including
  RC8) is latched for use in an internal raster compare. When the current
  raster matches the written value, the raster interrupt latch is set."
"In the context of the C64, What are the key components of the 6581 synthesizer chip?","DESCRIPTION

    The 6581 consists of three synthesizer 'voices' which can be used
  independently or in conjunction with each other (or external audio
  sources) to create complex sounds. Each voice consists of a Tone
  Oscillator/Waveform Generator, an Envelope Generator and an Amplitude
  Modulator. The Tone Oscillator controls the pitch of the voice over a
  wide range. The Oscillator produces four waveforms at the selected
  frequency, with the unique harmonic content of each waveform providing
  simple control of tone color. The volume dynamics of the oscillator are
  controlled by the Amplitude Modulator under the direction of the Envelope
  Generator. When triggered, the Envelope Generator creates an amplitude
  envelope with programmable rates of increasing and decreasing volume. In
  addition to the three voices, a programmable Filter is provided for
  generating complex, dynamic tone colors via subtractive synthesis.
    SID allows the microprocessor to read the changing output of the third
  Oscillator and third Envelope Generator. These outputs can be used as a
  source of modulation information for creating vibrato, frequency/filter
  sweeps and similar effects. The third oscillator can also act as a random
  number generator for games. Two A/D converters are provided for inter-
  facing SID with potentiometers. These can be used for 'paddles' in a
  game environment or as front panel controls in a music synthesizer. SID
  can process external audio signals, allowing multiple SID chips to be
  daisy-chained or mixed in complex polyphonic systems."

"In the context of the C64, Can you talk about the zero page addressing mode?","ADDRESSING MODES

  ZERO PAGE

  Absolute addresses are expressed in terms of a high
  and a low order byte. The high order byte is often referred to as the
  page of memory. For example, the address $1637 is in page $16 (22), and
  $0277 is in page $02 (2). There is, however, a special mode of addressing
  known as zero page addressing and is, as the name implies, associated
  with the addressing of memory locations in page zero. These addresses,
  therefore, ALWAYS have a high order byte of zero. The zero page mode of
  addressing only expects one byte to describe the address, rather than two
  when using an absolute address. The zero page addressing mode tells the
  microprocessor to assume that the high order address is zero. Therefore
  zero page addressing can reference memory locations whose addresses are
  between $0000 and $00FF. This may not seem too important at the moment,
  but you'll need the principles of zero page addressing soon."

  RUNNING COMMODORE CP/M(R)

    To run CP/M(R):

      1) LOAD the CP/M(R) program from your disk drive.
      2) Type RUN.
      3) Hit the <RETURN> key.
    At this point the 64K bytes of RAM in the Commodore 64 are accessible
  by the built-in 6510 central processor, OR 48K bytes of RAM are available
  for the Z-80 central processor. You can shift back and forth between
  these two processors, but you can NOT use them at the same time in a
  single program. This is possible because of your Commodore 64's
  sophisticated timing mechanism.
    Below is the memory address translation that is performed on the Z-80
  cartridge. You should notice that by adding 4096 bytes to the memory
  locations used in CP/M(R) $1000 (hex) you equal the memory addresses of
  the normal Commodore 64 operating system. The correspondence between Z-80
  and 6510 memory addresses is as follows:"
"In the context of the C64, What are the error messages generated by the Commodore-64?","ERROR MESSAGES

    This appendix contains a complete list of the error messages generated
  by the Commodore-64, with a description of causes.


  BAD DATA            String data was received from an open file, but the
                      program was expecting numeric data.
  BAD SUBSCRIPT       The program was trying to reference an element of an
                      array whose number is outside of the range specified
                      in the DIM statement.
  BREAK               Program execution was stopped because you hit the
                      <STOP> key.
  CAN'T CONTINUE      The CONT command will not work, either because the
                      program was never RUN, there has been an error, or
                      a line has been edited.
  DEVICE NOT PRESENT  The required I/O device was not available for an
                      OPEN, CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#, or GET#.
  DIVISION BY ZERO    Division by zero is a mathematical oddity and not
                      allowed.
  EXTRA IGNORED       Too many items of data were typed in response to an
                      INPUT statement. Only the first few items were
                      accepted.
  FILE NOT FOUND      If you were looking for a file on tape, and END-OF-
                      TAPE marker was found. If you were looking on disk,
                      no file with that name exists.
  FILE NOT OPEN       The file specified in a CLOSE, CMD, PRINT#, INPUT#,
                      or GET#, must first be OPENed.
  FILE OPEN           An attempt was made to open a file using the number
                      of an already open file.
  FORMULA TOO COMPLEX The string expression being evaluated should be split
                      into at least two parts for the system to work with,
                      or a formula has too many parentheses.
  ILLEGAL DIRECT      The INPUT statement can only be used within a pro-
                      gram, and not in direct mode.
  ILLEGAL QUANTITY    A number used as the argument of a function or
                      statement is out of the allowable range.
  LOAD                There is a problem with the program on tape.
  NEXT WITHOUT FOR    This is caused by either incorrectly nesting loops or
                      having a variable name in a NEXT statement that
                      doesn't correspond with one in a FOR statement.
  NOT INPUT FILE      An attempt was made to INPUT or GET data from a file
                      which was specified to be for output only.
  NOT OUTPUT FILE     An attempt was mode to PRINT data to a file which was
                      specified as input only.
  OUT OF DATA         A READ statement was executed but there is no data
                      left unREAD in a DATA statement.
  OUT OF MEMORY       There is no more RAM available for program or
                      variables. This may also occur when too many FOR
                      loops have been nested, or when there are too many
                      GOSUBs in effect.
  OVERFLOW            The result of a computation is larger than the
                      largest number allowed, which is 1.70141884E+38.
  REDIM'D ARRAY       An array may only be DiMensioned once. If an array
                      variable is used before that array is DIM'D, an
                      automatic DIM operation is performed on that array
                      setting the number of elements to ten, and any
                      subsequent DIMs will cause this error.
  REDO FROM START     Character data was typed in during an INPUT statement
                      when numeric data was expected. Just re-type the
                      entry so that it is correct, and the program will
                      continue by itself.
  RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB  A RETURN statement was encountered, and no GOSUB
                      command has been issued.
  STRING TOO LONG     A string can contain up to 255 characters.
  ?SYNTAX ERROR       A statement is unrecognizable by the Commodore 64. A
                      missing or extra parenthesis, misspelled keywords,
                      etc.
  TYPE MISMATCH       This error occurs when a number is used in place of a
                      string, or vice-versa.
  UNDEF'D FUNCTION    A user defined function was referenced, but it has
                      never been defined using the DEF FN statement.
  UNDEF'D STATEMENT   An attempt was made to GOTO or GOSUB or RUN a line
                      number that doesn't exist.
  VERIFY              The program on tape or disk does not match the
                      program currently in memory."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary function of the Time of Day (TOD) clock?","Time of Day Clock (TOD)

    The TOD clock is a special purpose timer for real-time applications.
  TOD consists of a 24-hour (AM/PM) clock with 1/10th second resolution. It
  is organized into 4 registers: 10ths of seconds, Seconds, Minutes and
  Hours. The AM/PM flag is in the MSB of the Hours register for easy bit
  testing. Each register reads out in BCD format to simplify conversion for
  driving displays, etc. The clock requires an external 60 Hz or 50 Hz
  (programmable) TTL level input on the TOD pin for accurate time-keeping.
  In addition to time-keeping, a programmable ALARM is provided for
  generating an interrupt at a desired time. The ALARM registers or located
  at the same addresses as the corresponding TOD registers. Access to the
  ALARM is governed by a Control Register bit. The ALARM is write-only; any
  read of a TOD address will read time regardless of the state of the ALARM
  access bit.
    A specific sequence of events must be followed for proper setting and
  reading of TOD. TOD is automatically stopped whenever a write to the
  Hours register occurs. The clock will not start again until after a write
  to the 10ths of seconds register. This assures TOD will always start at
  the desired time. Since a carry from one stage to the next can occur at
  any time with respect to a read operation, a latching function is
  included to keep all Time Of Day information constant during a read
  sequence. All four TOD registers latch on a read of Hours and remain
  latched until after a read of 10ths of seconds. The TOD clock continues
  to count when the output registers are latched. If only one register is
  to be read, there is no carry problem and the register can be read 'on
  the fly,' provided that any read of Hours is followed by a read of 10ths
  of seconds to disable the latching."
"In the context of the C64, What is the maximum number of unique sprites that can be displayed simultaneously?","SPRITES

    The movable object block (sprite) is a special type of character which can
  be displayed at any one position on the screen without the block
  constraints inherent in character and bit map mode. Up to 8 unique sprites
  can be displayed simultaneously, each defined by 63 bytes in memory which
  are displayed as a 24*21 dot array (shown below). A number of special
  features make sprites especially suited for video graphics and game
  applications.

"In the context of the C64, Can you describe the LDA?","LDA - LOAD THE ACCUMULATOR

    In 6510 assembly language, mnemonics are always three characters. LDA
  represents 'load accumulator with...', and what the accumulator should be
  loaded with is decided by the parameter(s) associated with that
  instruction. The assembler knows which token is represented by each
  mnemonic, and when it 'assembles' an instruction, it simply puts into
  memory (at whatever address has been specified), the token, and what
  parameters, are given. Some assemblers give error messages, or warnings
  when you try to assemble something that either the assembler, or the 6510
  microprocessor, cannot do.
    If you put a '#' symbol in front of the parameter associated with the
  instruction, this means that you want the register specified in the
  instruction to be loaded with the 'value' after the '#'. For example:

    LDA #$05  <----[ $=HEX ]

  This instruction will put $05 (decimal 5) into the accumulator register.
  The assembler will put into the specified address for this instruction,
  $A9 (which is the token for this particular instruction, in this mode),
  and it will put $05 into the next location after the location containing
  the instruction ($A9).
    If the parameter to be used by an instruction has '#' before it; i.e.,
  the parameter is a 'value,' rather than the contents of a memory loca-
  tion, or another register, the instruction is said to be in the
  'immediate' mode. To put this into perspective, let's compare this with
  another mode:
    If you want to put the contents of memory location $102E into the
  accumulator, you're using the 'absolute' mode of instruction:

    LDA $102E

  The assembler can distinguish between the two different modes because the
  latter does not have a '#' before the parameter. The 6510 microprocessor
  can distinguish between the immediate mode, and the absolute mode of the
  LDA instruction, because they have slightly different tokens. LDA
  (immediate) has $A9 as its token, and LDA (absolute), has $AD as its
  token."

"In the context of the C64, What is the maximum addressable memory location that a sprite pointer can point to?","SPRITE POINTERS

    Even though each sprite takes only 63 bytes to define, one more byte
  is needed as a place holder at the end of each sprite. Each sprite, then,
  takes up 64 bytes. This makes it easy to calculate where in memory your
  sprite definition is, since 64 bytes is an even number and in binary it's
  an even power.
    Each of the 8 sprites has a byte associated with it called the SPRITE
  POINTER. The sprite pointers control where each sprite definition is lo-
  cated in memory. These 8 bytes are always located as the lost 8 bytes
  of the 1K chunk of screen memory. Normally, on the Commodore 64, this
  means they begin at location 2040 ($07F8 in HEX). However, if you move
  the screen, the location of your sprite pointers will also move.
    Each sprite pointer can hold a number from 0 to 255. This number points
  to the definition for that sprite. Since each sprite definition takes
  64 bytes, that means that the pointer can 'see' anywhere in the 16K
  block of memory that the VIC-II chip can access (since 256*64=16K)."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary advantage of using multi-color mode graphics over standard high-resolution graphics?","MULTI-COLOR MODE GRAPHICS

    Standard high-resolution graphics give you control of very small dots
  on the screen. Each dot in character memory can have 2 possible values,
  1 for on and 0 for off. When a dot is off, the color of the screen is
  used in the space reserved for that dot. If the dot is on, the dot is
  colored with the character color you have chosen for that screen posi-
  tion. When you're using standard high-resolution graphics, all the dots
  within each 8X8 character can either have background color or foreground
  color. In some ways this limits the color resolution within that space.
  For example, problems may occur when two different colored lines cross.
    Multi-color mode gives you a solution to this problem. Each dot in
  multi-color mode can be one of 4 colors: screen color (background color
  register #0), the color in background register #1, the color in back-
  ground color register #2, or character color. The only sacrifice is in
  the horizontal resolution, because each multi-color mode dot is twice as
  wide as a high-resolution dot. This minimal loss of resolution is more
  than compensated for by the extra abilities of multi-color mode."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the interrupt register?","INTERRUPT REGISTER

    The interrupt register shows the status of the four sources of
  interrupt. An interrupt latch in register 25 ($19) is set to '1' when an
  interrupt source has generated an interrupt request. The four sources of
  interrupt are:

   LATCH |ENABLE|
    BIT  | BIT  |                       WHEN SET
    IRST | ERST | Set when (raster count) = (stored raster count)
    IMDC | EMDC | Set by sprite-DATA collision register (first collision only)
    IMMC | EMMC | Set by sprite-sprite collision register (first collision only)
    ILP  | ELP  | Set by negative transition of LP input (once per frame)
    IRQ  |      | Set high by latch set and enabled (invert of /IRQ output)

    To enable an interrupt request to set the /IRQ output to '0', the
  corresponding interrupt enable bit in register 26 ($1A) must be set to
  '1'. Once an interrupt latch has been set, the latch may be cleared only
  by writing a '1' to the desired latch in the interrupt register. This
  feature allows selective handling of video interrupts without software
  required to 'remember' active interrupts."
"In the context of the C64, given the SID register description","SID REGISTER DESCRIPTION

  VOICE 1

  FREQ LO/FREQ HI (Registers 00,01)

    Together these registers form a 16-bit number which linearly controls
  the frequency of Oscillator 1 . The frequency is determined by the
  following equation:

                       Fout = (Fn*Fclk/16777216) Hz

    Where Fn is the 16-bit number in the Frequency registers and Fclk is
  the system clock applied to the 02 input (pin 6). For a standard 1.0-MHz
  clock, the frequency is given by:

                       Fout = (Fn*0.059604645) Hz

    A complete table of values for generating 8 octaves of the equally
  tempered musical scale with concert A (440 Hz) tuning is provided in
  Appendix E. It should be noted that the frequency resolution of SID is
  sufficient for any tuning scale and allows sweeping from note to note
  (portamento) with no discernable frequency steps."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary function of the built-in dynamic RAM refresh controller in the 6566/6567 devices?","DYNAMIC RAM REFRESH

    A dynamic ram refresh controller is built in to the 6566/6567 devices.
  Five 8-bit row addresses are refreshed every raster line. This rate
  guarantees a maximum delay of 2.02 ms between the refresh of any single
  row address in a 128 refresh scheme. (The maximum delay is 3.66 ms in a
  256 address refresh scheme.) This refresh is totally transparent to the
  system, since the refresh occurs during Phase 1 of the system clock. The
  6567 generates both /RAS and /CAS which are normally connected directly
  to the dynamic rams. /RAS and /CAS are generated for every Phase 2 and
  every video data access (including refresh) so that external clock
  generation is not required.

"In the context of the C64, What is the size of a standard (HI-RES) sprite in terms of dots?","DEFINING A SPRITE

    Sprites are defined like programmable characters are defined. However,
  since the size of the sprite is larger, more bytes are needed. A sprite
  is 24 by 21 dots, or 504 dots. This works out to 63 bytes (504/8 bits)

    A way to view how a sprite is created is to take a look at the
  sprite definition block on the bit level. 

  In a standard (HI-RES) sprite, each bit set to I is displayed in that
  sprite's foreground color. Each bit set to 0 is transparent and will
  display whatever data is behind it. This is similar to a standard
  character.
    Multi-color sprites are similar to multi-color characters. Horizontal
  resolution is traded for extra color resolution. The resolution of the
  sprite becomes 12 horizontal dots by 21 vertical dots. Each dot in the
  sprite becomes twice as wide, but the number of colors displayable in the
  sprite is increased to 4."

"In the context of the C64, Describe the multicolor Bitmap mode","MULTI-COLOR BIT MAP MODE (BMM = MCM = 1)

    Multi-colored bit map mode is selected by setting the MCM bit in
  register 22 ($16) to a '1' in conjunction with the BMM bit. Multi-color
  mode uses the same memory access sequences as standard bit map mode, but
  interprets the dot data as follows:

        BIT PAIR      |                   DISPLAY COLOR
           00         |  Background #0 color (register 33 ($21))
           01         |  Upper nybble of video matrix pointer
           10         |  Lower nybble of video matrix pointer
           11         |  Video matrix color nybble

  Note that the color nybble (DB11-DB8) IS used for the multi-color bit map
  mode. Again, as two bits are used to select one dot color, the horizontal
  dot size is doubled, resulting in a screen resolution of 160H*200V.
  Utilizing multi-color bit map mode, three independently selected colors
  can be displayed in each 8*8 block in addition to the background color."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary function of the Serial Port (SDR)?","Serial Port (SDR)

    The serial port is a buffered, 8-bit synchronous shift register system.
  A control bit selects input or output mode. In input mode, data on the SP
  pin is shifted into the shift register on the rising edge of the signal
  applied to the CNT pin. After 8 CNT pulses, the data in the shift
  register is dumped into the Serial Data Register and an interrupt is
  generated. In the output mode, TIMER A is used for the baud rate
  generator. Data is shifted out on the SP pin at 1/2 the underflow rate of
  TIMER A. The maximum baud rate possible is 02 divided by 4, but the
  maximum useable baud rate will be determined by line loading and the
  speed at which the receiver responds to input data. Transmission will
  start following a write to the Serial Data Register (provided TIMER A is
  running and in continuous mode). The clock signal derived from TIMER A
  appears as an output on the CNT pin. The data in the Serial Data Register
  will be loaded into the shift register then shift out to the SP pin when
  a CNT pulse occurs. Data shifted out becomes valid on the falling edge of
  CNT and remains valid until the next falling edge. After 8 CNT pulses, an
  interrupt is generated to indicate more data can be sent. If the Serial
  Data Register was loaded with new information prior to this interrupt,
  the new data will automatically be loaded into the shift register and
  transmission will continue. If the microprocessor stays one byte ahead of
  the shift register, transmission will be continuous. If no further data
  is to be transmitted, after the 8th CNT pulse, CNT will return high and
  SP will remain at the level of the last data bit transmitted. SDR data is
  shifted out MSB first and serial input data should also appear in this
  format.
    The bidirectional capability of the Serial Port and CNT clock allows
  many 6526 devices to be connected to a common serial communication bus on
  which one 6526 acts as a master, sourcing data and shift clock, while all
  other 6526 chips act as slaves. Both CNT and SP outputs are open drain to
  allow such a common bus. Protocol for master/slave selection can be
  transmitted over the serial bus, or via dedicated handshaking lines."

"In the context of the C64, What is the indirect indexed addressing mode?","INDIRECT INDEXED

    This only allows usage of the Y register as the index. The actual ad-
  dress can only be in zero page, and the mode of instruction is called
  indirect because the zero page address specified in the instruction con-
  tains the low byte of the actual address, and the next byte to it
  contains the high order byte.

 EXAMPLE:

    Let us suppose that location $02 contains $45, and location $03 con-
  tains $1E. If the instruction to load the accumulator in the indirect
  indexed mode is executed and the specified zero page address is $02, then
  the actual address will be:

    Low order = contents of $02
    High order = contents of $03
    Y register = $00

  Thus the actual address = $1E45 + Y = $1E45.
    The title of this mode does in fact imply an indirect principle,
  although this may be difficult to grasp at first sight. Let's look at it
  another way:
    'I am going to deliver this letter to the post office at address $02,
  MEMORY ST., and the address on the letter is $05 houses past $1600,
  MEMORY street.' This is equivalent to the code:

    LDA #$00      - load low order actual base address
    STA $02       - set the low byte of the indirect address
    LDA #$16      - load high order indirect address
    STA $03       - set the high byte of the indirect address
    LDY #$05      - set the indirect index (Y)
    LDA ($02),Y   - load indirectly indexed by Y"
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary strategy for approaching a large task in machine language programming?","APPROACHING A LARGE TASK

    When approaching a large task in machine language, a certain amount of
  subconscious thought has usually taken place. You think about how certain
  processes are carried out in machine language. When the task is started,
  it is usually a good idea to write it out on paper. Use block diagrams of
  memory usage, functional modules of code required, and a program flow.
  Let's say that you wanted to write a roulette game in machine language.
  You could outline it something like this:

    o Display title
    o Ask if player requires instructions
    o YES - display them-Go to START
    o NO - Go to START
    o START Initialize everything
    o MAIN display roulette table
    o Take in bets
    o Spin wheel
    o Slow wheel to stop
    o Check bets with result
    o Inform player
    o Player any money left?
    o YES - Go to MAIN
    o NO - Inform user!, and go to START


    This is the main outline. As each module is approached, you can break
  it down further. If you look at a large indigestable problem as something
  that can be broken down into small enough pieces to be eaten, then you'll
  be able to approach something that seems impossible, and have it all fall
  into place.
    This process only improves with practice, so KEEP TRYING."

"In the context of the C64, What is the standard character mode ?","STANDARD CHARACTER MODE

    Standard character mode is the mode the Commodore 64 is in when you
  first turn it on. It is the mode you will generally program in.
    Characters can be taken from ROM or from RAM, but normally they are
  taken from ROM. When you want special graphics characters for a program,
  all you have to do is define the new character shapes in RAM, and tell
  the VIC-II chip to get its character information from there instead of
  the character ROM. This is covered in more detail in the next section.
    In order to display characters on the screen in color, the VIC-II chip
  accesses the screen memory to determine the character code for that
  location on the screen. At the same time, it accesses the color memory to
  determine what color you want for the character displayed. The character
  code is translated by the VIC-II into the starting address of the 8-byte
  block holding your character pattern. The 8-byte block is located in
  character memory.
    The translation isn't too complicated, but a number of items are com-
  bined to generate the desired address. First the character code you use
  to POKE screen memory is multiplied by 8. Next add the start of char-
  acter memory (see CHARACTER MEMORY section). Then the Bank Select Bits
  are taken into account by adding in the base address (see VIDEO BANK
  SELECTION section). Below is a simple formula to illustrate what happens:
  CHARACTER ADDRESS = SCREEN CODE*8+(CHARACTER SET*2048)+(BANK*16384)"
"In the context of the C64, What are some essential tips and strategies for a beginner to learn and master machine language programming?","USEFUL TIPS FOR THE BEGINNER

    One of the best ways to learn machine language is to look at other
  peoples' machine language programs. These are published all the time in
  magazines and newsletters. Look at them even if the article is for a
  different computer, which also uses the 6510 (or 6502) microprocessor.
  You should make sure that you thoroughly understand the code that you
  look at. This will require perseveres I ce, especially when you see a new
  technique that you have never come across before. This can be infuriat-
  ing, but if patience prevails, you will be the victor.
    Having looked at other machine language programs, you MUST write your
  own. These may be utilities for your BASIC programs, or they may be an
  all machine language program.
    You should also use the utilities that are available, either IN your
  computer, or in a program, that aid you in writing, editing, or tracking
  down errors in a machine language program. An example would be the
  KERNAL, which allows you to check the keyboard, print text, control
  peripheral devices like disk drives, printers, modems, etc., manage
  memory and the screen. It is extremely powerful and it is advised
  strongly that it is used (refer to KERNAL section, Page 268).
    Advantages of writing programs in machine language:

    1. Speed - Machine language is hundreds, and in some cases thousands of
       times faster than a high level language such as BASIC.

    2. Tightness - A machine language program can be made totally
       'watertight,' i.e., the user can be made to do ONLY what the program
        allows, and no more. With a high level language, you are relying on
        the user not 'crashing' the BASIC interpreter by entering, for
        example, a zero which later causes a:


  ?DIVISION BY ZERO ERROR IN LINE 830

  READY.


  In essence, the computer can only be maximized by the machine language
  programmer."
"In the context of the C64, What is indexing in the context of the 6510 microprocessor?","INDEXING

    Indexing plays an extremely important part in the running of the 6510
  microprocessor. It can be defined as 'creating an actual address from a
  base address plus the contents of either the X or Y index registers.'
    For example, if X contains $05, and the microprocessor executes an LDA
  instruction in the 'absolute X indexed mode' with base address (e.g.,
  $9000), then the actual location that is loaded into the A register is
  $9000 + $05 = $9005. The mnemonic format of an absolute indexed
  instruction is the same as an absolute instruction except a ',X' or ',Y'
  denoting the index is added to the address.

  EXAMPLE:

    LDA $9000,X

    There are absolute indexed, zero page indexed, indirect indexed, and
  indexed indirect modes of addressing available on the 6510
  microprocessor."

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the Reset signal in the 6510 microprocessor?","SIGNAL DESCRIPTION

  Clocks (01, 02)

    The 6510 requires a two-phase non-overlapping clock that runs at the
  Vcc voltage level.

  Address Bus (A0-A15)

    These outputs are TTL compatible, capable of driving one standard TTL
  load and 130 pf.

  Data Bus (D0-D7)

    Eight pins are used for the data bus. This is a Bi-Directional bus,
  transferring data to and from the device and peripherals. The outputs are
  tri-state buffers capable of driving one standard TTL load and 130 pf.

  Reset

    This input is used to reset or start the microprocessor from a power
  down condition. During the time that this line is held low, writing to or
  from the microprocessor is inhibited. When a positive edge is detected on
  the input, the microprocessor will immediately begin the reset sequence.
    After a system initialization time of six clock cycles, the mask
  interrupt flag will be set and the microprocessor will load the program
  counter from the memory vector locations FFFC and FFFD. This is the start
  location for program control.
    After Vcc reaches 4.75 volts in a power-up routine, reset must be held
  low for at least two clock cycles. At this time the R/W signal will
  become valid.
    When the reset signal goes high following these two clock cycles, the
  microprocessor will proceed with the normal reset procedure detailed
  above.

  Interrupt Request (/IRQ)

    This TTL level input requests that an interrupt sequence begin within
  the microprocessor. The microprocessor will complete the current in-
  struction being executed before recognizing the request. At that time,
  the interrupt mask bit in the Status Code Register will be examined. If
  the interrupt mask flag is not set, the microprocessor will begin an

   interrupt sequence. The Program Counter and Processor Status Register are
  stored in the stack. The microprocessor will then set the interrupt mask
  flag high so that no further interrupts may occur. At the end of this
  cycle, the program counter low will be loaded from address FFFE, and
  program counter high from location FFFF, therefore transferring program
  control to the memory vector located at these addresses.

  Address Enable Control (AEC)

    The Address Bus is valid only when the Address Enable Control line is
  high. When low, the Address Bus is in a high-impedance state. This
  feature allows easy DMA and multiprocessor systems.

  I/O Port (P0-P7)

    Six pins are used for the peripheral port, which can transfer data to
  or from peripheral devices. The Output Register is located in RAM at

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the Indexed Indirect addressing mode in 6502 assembly language?","INDEXED INDIRECT

    Indexed indirect only allows usage of the X register as the index. This
  is the some as indirect indexed, except it is the zero page address of
  the pointer that is indexed, rather than the actual base address.
  Therefore, the actual base address IS the actual address because the
  index has already been used for the indirect. Index indirect would also
  be used if a table of indirect pointers were located in zero page memory,
  and the X register could then specify which indirect pointer to use.

 EXAMPLE:

    Let us suppose that location $02 contains $45, and location $03 con-
  tains $10. If the instruction to load the accumulator in the indexed
  indirect mode is executed and the specified zero page address is $02,
  then the actual address will be:

    Low order = contents of ($02+X)
    High order = contents of ($03+X)
    X register = $00

  Thus the actual pointer is in = $02 + X = $02.
    Therefore, the actual address is the indirect address contained in $02
  which is again $1045.
    The title of this mode does in fact imply the principle, although it
  may be difficult to grasp at first sight. Look at it this way:
    'I am going to deliver this letter to the fourth post office at address
  $01,MEMORY ST., and the address on the letter will then be delivered to
  $1600, MEMORY street.' This is equivalent to the code:


    LDA #$00    - load low order actual base address
    STA $06     - set the low byte of the indirect address
    LDA #$16    - load high order indirect address
    STA $07     - set the high byte of the indirect address
    LDX #$05    - set the indirect index (X)
    LDA ($02,X) - load indirectly indexed by X"
"In the context of the C64, How can you create your own character sets on the Commodore 64?","PROGRAMMABLE CHARACTERS

    Since the characters are stored in ROM, it would seem that there is no
  way to change them for customizing characters. However, the memory
  location that tells the VIC-II chip where to find the characters is a
  programmable register which can be changed to point to many sections of
  memory. By changing the character memory pointer to point to RAM, the
  character set may be programmed for any need.
    If you want your character set to be located in RAM, there are a few
  VERY IMPORTANT things to take into account when you decide to actually
  program your own character sets. In addition, there are two other
  important points you must know to create your own special characters:

    1) It is an all or nothing process. Generally, if you use your own
       character set by telling the VIC-II chip to get the character
       information from the area you have prepared in RAM, the standard
     Commodore 64 characters are unavailable to you. To solve this, you
     must copy any letters, numbers, or standard Commodore 64 graphics you
     intend to use into your own character memory in RAM. You can pick and
     choose, take only the ones you want, and don't even have to keep them
     in order!

    2) Your character set takes memory space away from your BASIC program.
       Of course, with 38K available for a BASIC program, most applications
       won't have problems.
   WARNING: You must be careful to protect the character set from being  
   overwritten by your BASIC program, which also uses the RAM.           

    There are two locations in the Commodore 64 to start your character set
  that should NOT be used with BASIC: location 0 and location 2048. The
  first should not be used because the system stores important data on
  page 0. The second can't be used because that is where your BASIC program
  starts! However, there are 6 other starting positions for your custom
  character set.
    The best place to put your character set for use with BASIC while
  experimenting is beginning at 12288 ($3000 in HEX). This is done by
  POKEing the low 4 bits of location 53272 with 12."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the AEC signal in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","THEORY OF OPERATION

  SYSTEM INTERFACE

    The 6566/6567 video controller devices interact with the system data
  bus in a special way. A 65XX system requires the system buses only during
  the Phase 2 (clock high) portion of the cycle. The 6566/6567 devices take
  advantage of this feature by normally accessing system memory during the
  Phase 1 (clock low) portion of the clock cycle. Therefore, operations
  such as character data fetches and memory refresh are totally transparent
  to the processor and do not reduce the processor throughput. The video
  chips provide the interface control signals required to maintain this bus
  sharing.
    The video devices provide the signal AEC (address enable control) which
  is used to disable the processor address bus drivers allowing the video
  device to access the address bus. AEC is active low which, permits direct
  connection to the AEC input of the 65XX family. The AEC signal is
normally activated during Phase 1 so that processor operation is not
  affected. Because of this bus 'sharing', all memory accesses must be
  completed in 1/2 cycle. Since the video chips provide a 1-MHz clock
  (which must be used as system Phase 2), a memory cycle is 500 ns
  including address setup, data access and, data setup to the reading
  device.
    Certain operations of the 6566/6567 require data at a faster rate than
  available by reading only during the Phase 1 time; specifically, the ac-
  cess of character pointers from the video matrix and the fetch of sprite
  data. Therefore, the processor must be disabled and the data accessed
  during the Phase 2 clock. This is accomplished via the BA (bus available)
  signal. The BA line is normally high but is brought low during Phase 1 to
  indicate that the video chip will require a Phase 2 data access. Three
  Phase-2 times are allowed after BA low for the processor to complete any
  current memory accesses. On the fourth Phase 2 after BA low, the AEC
  signal will remain low during Phase 2 as the video chip fetches data. The
  BA line is normally connected to the RDY input of a 65XX processor. The
  character pointer fetches occur every eighth raster line during the
  display window and require 40 consecutive Phase 2 accesses to fetch the
  video matrix pointers. The sprite data fetches require 4 memory accesses as
  follows:


     PHASE 1   | sprite Pointer |   CONDITION: Every raster
     PHASE  2   | sprite Byte 1  | CONDITION : Each raster while sprite is displayed
     PHASE  1   | sprite Byte 2  | CONDITION :  Each raster while sprite is displayed
     PHASE  2   | sprite Byte 3  | CONDITION : Each raster while sprite is displayed


  The sprite pointers are fetched every other Phase 1 at the end of each
  raster line. As required, the additional cycles are used for sprite data
  fetches. Again, all necessary bus control is provided by the 6566/6567
  devices."
"In the context of the C64, What are the key differences in address output configurations between the 6566 and 6567 video interface chips?","MEMORY INTERFACE

    The two versions of the video interface chip, 6566 and 6567, differ in
  address output configurations. The 6566 has thirteen fully decoded
  addresses for direct connection to the system address bus. The 6567 has
  multiplexed addresses for direct connection to 64K dynamic RAMS. The
  least significant address bits, A06-A00, are present on A06-A00 while
  /RAS is brought low, while the most significant bits, A13-A08, are pres-
  ent on A05-A00 while /CAS is brought low. The pins A11-A07 on the 6567
  are static address outputs to allow direct connection of these bits to a
  conventional 16K (2K*8) ROM. (The lower order addresses require external
  latching.)"
"In the context of the C64, How are characters defined on the Commodore 64?","CHARACTER DEFINITIONS

    Each character is formed in an 8 by 8 grid of dots, where each dot may
  be either on or off. The Commodore 64 character images are stored in the
  Character Generator ROM chip. The characters are stored as a set of 8
  bytes for each character, with each byte representing the dot pattern of
  a row in the character, and each bit representing a dot. A zero bit means
  that dot is off, and a one bit means the dot is on.
    The character memory in ROM begins at location 53248 (when the I/O
  is switched off). The first 8 bytes from location 53248 ($D000) to 53255
  ($D007) contain the pattern for the @ sign, which has a character code
  value of zero in the screen memory. The next 8 bytes, from location
  53256 ($D008) to 53263 ($D00F), contain the information for forming the
  letter A.

    Each complete character set takes up 2K (2048 bits) of memory, 8 bytes
  per character and 256 characters. Since there are two character sets, one
  for upper case and graphics and the other with upper and lower case, the
  character generator ROM takes up a total of 4K locations."
"In the context of the C64, Wcan you talk about branches and testing in 6502 and 6510?","BRANCHES AND TESTING

    Another very important principle in machine language is the ability to
  test, and detect certain conditions, in a similar fashion to the 'IF...
  THEN, IF... GOTO' structure in CBM BASIC.
    The various flags in the status register are affected by different in-
  structions in different ways. For example, there is a flag that is set
  when an instruction has caused a zero result, and is reset when a result
  is not zero. The instruction:

    LDA #$00

  will cause the zero result flag to be set, because the instruction has
  resulted in the accumulator containing a zero.
    There are a set of instructions that will, given a particular
  condition, branch to another part of the program. An example of a branch
  instruction is BEQ, which means Branch if result EQual to zero. The
  branch instructions branch if the condition is true, and if not, the
  program continues onto the next instruction, as if nothing had occurred.
  The branch instructions branch not by the result of the previous
  instructions), but by internally examining the status register. As was
  just mentioned, there is a zero result flag in the status register. The
  BEQ instruction branches if the zero result flag (known as Z) is set.
  Every branch instruction has an opposite branch instruction. The BEQ
  instruction has an opposite instruction BNE, which means Branch on result
  Not Equal to zero (i.e., Z not set).
  
    The index registers have a number of associated instructions which
  modify their contents. For example, the INX instruction INcrements the X
  index register. If the X register contained $FF before it was incremented
  (the maximum number the X register can contain), it will 'wrap around'
  back to zero. If you wanted a program to continue to do something until
  you had performed the increment of the X index that pushed it around to
  zero, you could use the BNE instruction to continue 'looping' around,
  until X became zero.
  
    The reverse of INX, is DEX, which is DEcrement the X index register. If
  the X index register is zero, DEX wraps around to $FF. Similarly, there
  are INY and DEY for the Y index register.
 But what if a program didn't want to wait until X or Y had reached (or
  not reached) zero? Well there are comparison instructions, CPX and CPY,
  which allow the machine language programmer to test the index registers
  with specific values, or even the contents of memory locations. If you
  wanted to see if the X register contained $40, you would use the
  instruction:

    CPX #$40         - compare X with the 'value' $40.
    BEQ              - branch to somewhere else in the
    (some other        program, if this condition is 'true.'
     part of the
     program)


  The compare, and branch instructions play a major part in any machine
  language program.
    The operand specified in a branch instruction when using 64MON is the
  address of the part of the program that the branch goes to when the
  proper conditions are met. However, the operand is only an offset, which
  gets you from where the program currently is to the address specified.
  This offset is just one byte, and therefore the range that a branch
  instruction can branch to is limited. It can branch from 128 bytes back-
  ward, to 127 bytes forward.

 
  NOTE: This is a total range of 255 bytes which is, of course, the
  maximum range of values one byte can contain.
  
    64MON will tell you if you 'branch out of range' by refusing to 'as-
  semble' that particular instruction. But don't worry about that now be-
  cause it's unlikely that you will have such branches for quite a while.
  The branch is a 'quick' instruction by machine language standards because
  of the 'offset' principle as opposed to an absolute address. 64MON allows
  you to type in an absolute address, and it calculates the correct offset.
  This is just one of the 'comforts' of using an assembler."

"In the context of the C64, What are the 6526 interface signals?","6526 INTERFACE SIGNALS

  02-Clock Input

    The 02 clock is a TTL compatible input used for internal device opera-
  tion and as a timing reference for communicating with the system data
  bus.

  /CS-Chip Select Input

    The /CS input controls the activity of the 6526. A low level on /CS
  while 02 is high causes the device to respond to signals on the R/W and
  address (RS) lines. A high on /CS prevents these lines from controlling
  the 6526. The /CS line is normally activated (low) at 02 by the
  appropriate address combination.

  R/W-Read/Write Input

    The R/W signal is normally supplied by the microprocessor and controls
  the direction of data transfers of the 6526. A high on R/W indicates
  a read (data transfer out of the 6526), while a low indicates a write
  (data transfer into the 6526).

  RS3-RS0-Address Inputs

    The address inputs select the internal registers as described by the
  Register Map.

  DB7-DB0-Data Bus Inputs/Outputs

    The eight data bus pins transfer information between the 6526 and the
  system data bus. These pins are high impedance inputs unless CS is low
  and R/W and 02 are high to read the device. During this read, the data
  bus output buffers are enabled, driving the data from the selected
  register onto the system data bus.

  IRQ-Interrupt Request Output

    IRQ is an open drain output normally connected to the processor inter-
  rupt input. An external pullup resistor holds the signal high, allowing
  multiple IRQ outputs to be connected together. The IRQ output is normally
  off (high impedance) and is activated low as indicated in the functional
  description.

  /RES-Reset Input

    A low on the RES pin resets all internal registers. The port pins are
  set as inputs and port registers to zero (although a read of the ports
  will return all highs because of passive pullups). The timer control
  registers are set to zero and the timer latches to all ones. All other
  registers are reset to zero."
"In the context of the C64, What are the 9 addressing modes supported by the 6502/ 6510 CPU?","ADDRESSING MODES

  ACCUMULATOR ADDRESSING - This form of addressing is represented with a
  one byte instruction, implying an operation on the accumulator.

  IMMEDIATE ADDRESSING - In immediate addressing, the operand is contained
  in the second byte of the instruction, with no further memory addressing
  required.

  ABSOLUTE ADDRESSING - In absolute addressing, the second byte of the
  instruction specifies the eight low order bits of the effective address
  while the third byte specifies the eight high order bits. Thus, the
  absolute addressing mode allows access to the entire 64K bytes of
  addressable memory.

  ZERO PAGE ADDRESSING - The zero page instructions allow for shorter code
  and execution times by only fetching the second byte of the instruction
  and assuming a zero high address byte. Careful use of the zero page can
  result in significant increase in code efficiency.

  INDEXED ZERO PAGE ADDRESSING - (X, Y indexing)-This form of addressing is
  used in conjunction with the index register and is referred to as 'Zero
  Page, X' or 'Zero Page, Y.' The effective address is calculated by adding
  the second byte to the contents of the index register. Since this is a
  form of 'Zero Page' addressing, the content of the second byte references
  a location in page zero. Additionally, due to the 'Zero Page' addressing
  nature of this mode, no carry is added to the high order 8 bits of memory
  and crossing of page boundaries does not occur.

  INDEXED ABSOLUTE ADDRESSING - (X, Y indexing)-This form of addressing is
  used in conjunction with X and Y index register and is referred to as
  'Absolute, X,' and 'Absolute, Y.' The effective address is formed by
  adding the contents of X and Y to the address contained in the second and
  third bytes of the instruction. This mode allows the index register to
  contain the index or count value and the instruction to contain the base
  address. This type of indexing allows any location referencing and the
  index to modify multiple fields resulting in reduced coding and execution
  time.

  IMPLIED ADDRESSING - In the implied addressing mode, the address
  containing the operand is implicitly stated in the operation code of the
  instruction.

  RELATIVE ADDRESSING - Relative addressing is used only with branch
  instructions and establishes a destination for the conditional branch.
  The second byte of the instruction becomes the operand which is an
  'Offset' added to the contents of the lower eight bits of the program
  counter when the counter is set at the next instruction. The range of the
  offset is -128 to +127 bytes from the next instruction.

  INDEXED INDIRECT ADDRESSING - In indexed indirect addressing (referred to
  as [Indirect, X]), the second byte of the instruction is added to the
  contents of the X index register, discarding the carry. The result of
  this addition points to a memory location on page zero whose contents is
  the low order eight bits of the effective address. The next memory loca-
  tion in page zero contains the high order eight bits of the effective ad-
  dress. Both memory locations specifying the high and low order bytes of

  the effective address must be in page zero.

  INDIRECT INDEXED ADDRESSING - In indirect indexed addressing (referred to
  as [Indirect], Y), the second byte of the instruction points to a memory
  location in page zero. The contents of this memory location is added to
  the contents of the Y index register, the result being the low order
  eight bits of the effective address. The carry from this addition is
  added to the contents of the next page zero memory location, the result
  being the high order eight bits of the effective address.

  ABSOLUTE INDIRECT - The second byte of the instruction contains the low
  order eight bits of a memory location. The high order eight bits of that
  memory location is contained in the third byte of the instruction. The
  contents of the fully specified memory location is the low order byte of
  the effective address. The next memory location contains the high order
  byte of the effective address which is loaded into the sixteen bits of
  the program counter."

"In the context of the C64, What are the five main activities performed by the KERNAL during its power-up sequence?","KERNAL POWER-UP ACTIVITIES

  1) On power-up, the KERNAL first resets the stack pointer, and clears
     decimal mode.
  2) The KERNAL then checks for the presence of an autostart ROM cartridge
     at location $8000 HEX (32768 decimal). If this is present, normal
     initialization is suspended, and control is transferred to the car-
     tridge code. If an autostart ROM is not present, normal system ini-
     tialization continues.
  3) Next, the KERNAL initializes all INPUT/OUTPUT devices. The serial bus
     is initialized. Both 6526 CIA chips are set to the proper values for
     keyboard scanning, and the 60-Hz timer is activated. The SID chip is
     cleared. The BASIC memory map is selected and the cassette motor is
     switched off.
  4) Next, the KERNAL performs a RAM test, setting the top and bottom of
     memory pointers. Also, page zero is initialized, and the tape buffer
     is set up.
       The RAM TEST routine is a nondestructive test starting at location
     $0300 and working upward. Once the test has found the first non-RAM
     location, the top of RAM has its pointer set. The bottom of memory is
     always set to $0800, and the screen setup is always set at $0400.
  5) Finally, the KERNAL performs these other activities. I/O vectors are
     set to default values. The indirect jump table in low memory is estab-
     lished. The screen is then cleared, and all screen editor variables
     reset. Then the indirect at $A000 is used to start BASIC."

"In the context of the C64, What feature of the VIC-II chip allows for the detection of collisions between sprites and background data?","COLLISION DETECTS

    One of the more interesting aspects of the VIC-II chip is its collision
  detection abilities. Collisions can be detected between sprites, or be-
  tween sprites and background data. A collision occurs when a non-zero
  part of a sprite overlaps a non-zero portion of another sprite or char-
  acters on the screen."
"In the context of the C64, What is the primary way to access and modify the memory locations used for music synthesis in the Commodore 64?","Your Commodore computer is equipped with one of the most sophisticated
  electronic music synthesizers available on any computer. It comes
  complete with three voices, totally addressable, ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN/
  RELEASE (ADSR), filtering, modulation, and 'white noise.' All of these
  capabilities are directly available for you through a few easy to use
  BASIC and/or assembly language statements and functions. This means that
  you can make very complex sounds and songs using programs that are
  relatively simple to design.
    This section of your Programmer's Reference Guide has been created to
  help you explore all the capabilities of the 6581 'SID' chip, the sound
  and music synthesizer inside your Commodore computer. We'll explain both
  the theory behind musical ideas and the practical aspects of turning
  those ideas into real finished songs on your Commodore computer.
    You need not be an experienced programmer nor a music expert to achieve
  exciting results from the music synthesizer. This section is full of
  programming examples with complete explanations to get you started.
    You get to the sound generator by POKEing into specified memory
  locations. A full list of the locations used is provided in Appendix O.
  We will go through each concept, step by step. By the end you should be
  able to create an almost infinite variety of sounds, and be ready to
  perform experiments with sound on your own.
    Each section of this chapter begins by giving you an example and a full
  line-by-line description of each program, which will show you how to use
  the characteristic being discussed. The technical explanation is for you
  to read whenever you are curious about what is actually going on. The
  workhorse of your sound programs is the POKE statement. POKE sets the
  indicated memory location (MEM) equal to a specified value (NUM).
    POKE MEM,NUM
    The memory locations (MEM) used for music synthesis start at 54272
  ($D400) in the Commodore 64. The memory locations 54272 to 54296
  inclusive are the POKE locations you need to remember when you're using
  the 6581 (SID) chip register map. Another way to use the locations above
  is to remember only location 54272 and then add a number from 0 through
  24 to it. By doing this you can POKE all the locations from 54272 to
  54296 that you need from the SID chip. The numbers (NUM) that you use in
  your POKE statement must be between 0 and 255, inclusive.
    When you've had a little more practice with making music, then you can
  get a little more involved, by using the PEEK function. PEEK is a
  function that is equal to the value currently in the indicated memory
  location.
    X=PEEK(MEM)

    The value of the variable X is set equal to the current contents of
  memory location MEM.
    Of course, your programs include other BASIC commands, but for a full
  explanation of them, refer to the BASIC Statements section of this
  manual."
"In the context of the C64, HWhat is the process for positioning a sprite beyond the 255th pixel across the screen in a Commodore 64 game?","POKEING AN X POSITION: The possible values of X are 0 to 255, counting
  from left to right. Values 0 to 23 place all or part of the sprite OUT OF
  THE VIEWING AREA off the left side of the screen... values 24 to 255
  place the sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA up to the 255th position (see next
  paragraph for settings beyond the 255th X position). To place the sprite
  at one of these positions, just type the X-POSITION POKE for the sprite
  you're using. For example, to POKE sprite I at the farthest left X
  position IN THE VIEWING AREA, type: POKE V+2,24.

    X VALUES BEYOND THE 255TH POSITION: To get beyond the 255th position
  across the screen, you need to make a SECOND POKE using the numbers in
  the 'RIGHT X' row of the chart (Figure 3-5). Normally, the horizontal (X)
  numbering would continue past the 255th position to 256, 257, etc., but
  because registers only contain 8 bits we must use a 'second register' to
  access the RIGHT SIDE of the screen and start our X numbering over again
  at 0. So to get beyond X position 255, you must POKE V+16 and a number
  (depending on the sprite). This gives you 65 additional X positions
  (renumbered from 0 to 65) in the viewing area on the RIGHT side of the
  viewing screen. (You can actually POKE the right side X value as high as
  255, which takes you off the right edge of the viewing screen.)

    POKEING A Y POSITION: The possible values of Y are 0 to 255, counting
  from top to bottom. Values 0 to 49 place all or part of the sprite OUT
  OF THE VIEWING AREA off the TOP of the screen. Values 50 to 229 place the
  sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA. Values 230 to 255 place all or part of the
  sprite OUT OF THE VIEWING AREA off the BOTTOM of the screen.

    Let's see how this X-Y positioning works, using sprite 1. Type this
  program:
start tok64 page159.prg
  10 print'{clear}':v=53248:pokev+21,2:poke2041,13
  20 fors=832to895:pokes,255:next:pokev+40,7
  30 pokev+2,24
  40 pokev+3,50
stop tok64

  This simple program establishes sprite 1 as a solid box and positions it
  at the upper left corner of the screen. Now change line 40 to read:

    40 POKE V+3,229

  This moves the sprite to the bottom left corner of the screen. Now let's
  test the RIGHT X LIMIT of the sprite. Change line 30 as shown:

    30 POKE V+2,255

  This moves the sprite to the RIGHT but reaches the RIGHT X LIMIT, which
  is 255. At this point, the 'most significant bit' in register 16 must be
  SET. In other words, you must type POKE V+ 16 and the number shown in the
  'RIGHT X' column in the X-Y POKE CHART above to RESTART the X position
  counter at the 256th pixel/position on the screen. Change line 30 as
  follows:

    30 POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 2:POKE V+2,0

  POKE V+16,2 sets the most significant bit of the X position for sprite 1
  and restarts it at the 256th pixel/position on the screen. POKE V+2,0
  displays the sprite at the NEW POSITION ZERO, which is now reset to the
  256th pixel.
    To get back to the left side of the screen, you must reset the most
  significant bit of the X position counter to 0 by typing (for sprite 1):

    POKE V+16, PEEK(V+16)AND 253

    TO SUMMARIZE how the X positioning works... POKE the X POSITION for any
  sprite with a number from 0 to 255. To access a position beyond the 255th
  position/pixel across the screen, you must use an additional POKE (V+16)
  which sets the most significant bit of the X position and start counting
  from 0 again at the 256th pixel across the screen.

  This POKE starts the X numbering over again from 0 at the 256th position
  (Example: POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 1 and POKE V,1 must be included to place
  sprite 0 at the 257th pixel across the screen.) To get back to the left
  side X positions you have to TURN OFF the control setting by typing
  POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)AND 254."
"In the context of the C64, How do you control sprite to background priority?","Sprite to background priority is controllable by the SPRITE-BACK-GROUND priority register located at 53275 ($D01B).
  Each sprite has a bit in this register. If that bit is 0, that sprite has a higher priority
  than the background on the screen. In other words, the sprite appears in
  front of background data. If that bit is a 1, that sprite has a lower
  priority than the background. Then the sprite appears behind the back-
  ground data."

"In the context of the C64, What are the three simple steps to follow when using the KERNAL?","HOW TO USE THE KERNAL


    When writing machine language programs it is often convenient to use
  the routines which are already part of the operating system for input/
  output, access to the system clock, memory management, and other similar
  operations. It is an unnecessary duplication of effort to write these
  routines over and over again, so easy access to the operating system
  helps speed machine language programming.
    As mentioned before, the KERNAL is a jump table. This is just a col-
  lection of JMP instructions to many operating system routines.
    To use a KERNAL routine you must first make all of the preparations
  that the routine demands. If one routine says that you must call another
  KERNAL routine first, then that routine must be called. If the routine
  expects you to put a number in the accumulator, then that number must be
  there. Otherwise your routines have little chance of working the way you
  expect them to work.
    After all preparations are made, you must call the routine by means of
  the JSR instruction. All KERNAL routines you can access are structured as
  SUBROUTINES, and must end with an RTS instruction. When the KERNAL
  routine has finished its task, control is returned to your program at the
  instruction after the JSR.
    Many of the KERNAL routines return error codes in the status word or
  the accumulator if you have problems in the routine. Good programming
  practice and the success of your machine language programs demand that
  you handle this properly. If you ignore an error return, the rest of your
  program might 'bomb.'
    That's all there is to do when you're using the KERNAL. Just these
  three simple steps:

    1) Set up
    2) Call the routine
    3) Error handling

    The following conventions are used in describing the KERNAL routines:

  - FUNCTION NAME: Name of the KERNAL routine.

  - CALL ADDRESS: This is the call address of the KERNAL routine, given in
    hexadecimal.

  - COMMUNICATION REGISTERS: Registers listed under this heading are used
    to pass parameters to and from the KERNAL routines.

  - PREPARATORY ROUTINES: Certain KERNAL routines require that data be set
    up before they can operate. The routines needed are listed here.

  - ERROR RETURNS: A return from a KERNAL routine with the CARRY set
    indicates that an error was encountered in processing. The accumulator
    will contain the number of the error.

  - STACK REQUIREMENTS: This is the actual number of stack bytes used by
    the KERNAL routine.

  - REGISTERS AFFECTED: All registers used by the KERNAL routine are listed
    here.

  - DESCRIPTION: A short tutorial on the function of the KERNAL routine is
    given here.

"In the context of the C64, On can I mix 6502 assembler and Basic on the Commodore 64?","There are several methods of using BASIC and machine language on the
  Commodore 64, including special statements as part of CBM BASIC as well
  as key locations in the machine. There are five main ways to use machine
  language routines from BASIC on the Commodore 64. They are:


                1) The BASIC SYS statement
                2) The BASIC USR function
                3) Changing one of the RAM I/O vectors
                4) Changing one of the RAM interrupt vectors
                5) Changing the CHRGET routine


    1) The BASIC statement SYS X causes a JUMP to a machine language
       subroutine located at address X. The routine must end with an RTS
       (ReTurn from Subroutine) instruction. This will transfer control
       back to BASIC.
         Parameters are generally passed between the machine language
       routine and the BASIC program using the BASIC PEEK and POKE
       statements, and their machine language equivalents.
         The SYS command is the most useful method of combining BASIC with
       machine language. PEEKs and POKEs make multiple parameter passing
       easy. There can be many SYS statements in a program, each to a
       different (or even the same) machine language routine.

    2) The BASIC function USR(X) transfers control to the machine language
       subroutine located at the address stored in locations 785 and 786.
       (The address is stored in standard low-byte/high-byte format.) The
       value X is evaluated and passed to the machine language subroutine
       through floating point accumulator #1, located beginning at address
       $61 (see memory map for more details). A value may be returned back
       to the BASIC program by placing it in the floating point
       accumulator. The machine language routine must end with an RTS
       instruction to return to BASIC.
         This statement is different from the SYS, because you have to set
       up an indirect vector. Also different is the format through which
       the variable is passed (floating point format). The indirect vector
       must be changed if more than one machine language routine is used.


    3) Any of the inpUt/OUtPUT or BASIC internal routines accessed through
       the vector table located on page 3 (see ADDRESSING MODES, ZERO PAGE)
       can be replaced, or amended by user code. Each 2-byte vector
       consists of a low byte and a high byte address which is used by the
       operating system.
         The KERNAL VECTOR routine is the most reliable way to change any
       of the vectors, but a single vector can be changed by POKES. A new
       vector will point to a user prepared routine which is meant to
       replace or augment the standard system routine. When the appropriate
       BASIC command is executed, the user routine will be executed. If
       after executing the user routine, it is necessary to execute the
       normal system routine, the user program must JMP (JUMP) to the
       address formerly contained in the vector. If not, the routine must
       end with a RTS to transfer control back to BASIC.

    4) The HARDWARE INTERRUPT (IRQ) VECTOR can be changed. Every 1/60th of
       a second, the operating system transfers control to the routine
       specified by this vector. The KERNAL normally uses this for timing,
       keyboard scanning, etc. If this technique is used, you should always
       transfer control to the normal IRQ handling routine, unless the
       replacement routine is prepared to handle the CIA chip. (REMEMBER to
       end the routine with an RTI (ReTurn from Interrupt) if the CIA is
       handled by the routine).
         This method is useful for tasks which must happen concurrently
       with a BASIC program, but has the drawback of being more difficult.


NOTE: ALWAYS DISABLE INTERRUPTS BEFORE CHANGING THIS VECTOR!

    5) The CHRGET routine is used by BASIC to get each character/token.
       This makes it simple to add new BASIC commands. Naturally, each new
       command must be executed by a user written machine language
       subroutine. A common way to use this method is to specify a
       character (@ for example) which will occur before any of the new
       commands. The new CHRGET routine will search for the special
       character. If none is present, control is passed to the normal BASIC
       CHRGET routine. If the special character is present, the new command
       is interpreted and executed by your machine language program. This
       minimizes the extra execution time added by the need to search for
       additional commands. This technique is often called a wedge."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the kernal SECOND routine ?","B-27. Function Name: SECOND

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the two 9-pin Game Ports on the Commodore 64?","THE GAME PORTS

    The Commodore 64 has two 9-pin Game Ports which allow the use of
  joysticks, paddies, or a light pen. Each port will accept either one joy-
  stick or one paddle pair. A light pen can be plugged into Port A (only)
  for special graphic control, etc. This section gives you examples of how
  to use the joysticks and paddies from both BASIC and machine language.
    The digital joystick is connected to CIA #1 (MOS 6526 Complex Interface
  Adapter). This input/output device also handles the paddle fire buttons
  and keyboard scanning. The 6526 CIA chip has 16 registers which are in
  memory locations 56320 through 56335 inclusive ($DC00 to $DC0F). Port A
  data appears at location 56320 (DC00) and Port B data is found at
  location 56321 ($DC01).
    A digital joystick has five distinct switches, four of the switches are
  used for direction and one of the switches is used for the fire button.



    These switches correspond to the lower 5 bits of the data in location
  56320 or 56321. Normally the bit is set to a one if a direction is NOT
  chosen or the fire button is NOT pressed. When the fire button is
  pressed, the bit (bit 4 in this case) changes to a 0.

    You should be familiar with the PEEK and POKE commands in the CBM BASIC
  language for changing memory locations. You've probably used them for
  graphics on the screen, and for sound effects. Each memory location has
  its own number which identifies it. This number is known as the 'address'
  of a memory location. If you imagine the memory in the Commodore 64 as a
  street of buildings, then the number on each door is, of course, the
  address. Now let's look at which parts of the street are used for what
  purposes."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the ACPTR  kernal routine in a Commodore 64 system?","Description: This is the routine to use when you want to get informa-
  tion from a device on the serial bus, like a disk. This routine gets a
  byte of data off the serial bus using full handshaking. The data is
  returned in the accumulator. To prepare for this routine the TALK routine
  must be called first to command the device on the serial bus to send data
  through the bus. If the input device needs a secondary command, it must
  be sent by using the TKSA KERNAL routine before calling this routine.
  Errors are returned in the status word. The READST routine is used to
  read the status word.


  How to Use:

    0) Command a device on the serial bus to prepare to send data to
       the Commodore 64. (Use the TALK and TKSA KERNAL routines.)
    1) Call this routine (using JSR).
    2) Store or otherwise use the data.

"In the context of the C64, how do I display a sprite beyond the 255TH X-POSITION?","DISPLAYING A SPRITE BEYOND THE 255TH X-POSITION

    Displaying a sprite beyond the 255th X position requires a special POKE
  which SETS the most significant bit of the X position and starts over at
  the 256th pixel position across the screen. Here's how it works...
    First, you POKE V+16 with the number for the sprite you're using (check
  the 'RIGHT X' row in the X-Y chart... we'll use sprite 0). Now we assign
  an X position, keeping in mind that the X counter starts over from 0 at
  the 256th position on the screen. Change line 50 to read as follows:
    50 POKE V+16,1:POKE V,24:POKE V+1,75

  This line POKEs V+ 16 with the number required to 'open up' the right
  side of the screen... the new X position 24 for sprite 0 now begins 24
  pixels to the RIGHT of position 255. To check the right edge of the
  screen, change line 60 to:

    60 POKE V+16,1:POKE V,65:POKE V+1,75

    Some experimentation with the settings in the sprite chart will give
  you the settings you need to position and move sprites on the left and
  right sides of the screen. The section on 'moving sprites' will also
  increase your understanding of how sprite positioning works."
"In the context of the C64, What is the range of values that the volume control can be set to?","VOLUME CONTROL

  we'll get into later. For now it is enough to know volume is 0 to 15.

    Error returns:
    Stack requirements: 2

    Description: This routine sets the X and Y registers to the address of
  the memory section where the memory mapped 110 devices are located. This
  address can then be used with an offset to access the memory mapped I/O
  devices in the Commodore 64. The offset is the number of locations from
  the beginning of the page on which the I/O register you want is located.
  The X register contains the low order address byte, while the Y register
  contains the high order address byte.
    This routine exists to provide compatibility between the Commodore 64,
  VIC-20, and future models of the Commodore 64. If the J/0 locations for
  a machine language program are set by a call to this routine, they should
  still remain compatible with future versions of the Commodore 64, the
  KERNAL and BASIC.

"In the context of the C64, What determines the order in which sprites appear on the screen when they overlap?","SPRITE PRIORITIES

    You can actually make different sprites seem to move IN FRONT OF or
  BEHIND each other on the screen. This incredible three dimensional illu-
  sion is achieved by the built-in SPRITE PRIORITIES which determine which
  sprites have priority over the others when 2 or more sprites OVERLAP on
  the screen.
    The rule is 'first come, first served' which means lower-numbered
  sprites AUTOMATICALLY have priority over higher-numbered sprites. For
  example, if you display sprite 0 and sprite 1 so they overlap on the
  screen, sprite 0 will appear to be IN FRONT OF sprite 1. Actually, sprite
  0 always supersedes all the other sprites because it's the lowest num-
  bered sprite. In comparison, sprite 1 has priority over sprites 2-7;
  sprite 2 has priority over sprites 3-7, etc. Sprite 7 (the last sprite)
  has LESS PRIORITY than any of the other sprites, and will always appear
  to be displayed 'BEHIND' any other sprites which overlap its position.
    To illustrate how priorities work, change lines 50, 60, and 70 in the
  program above to the following:


  50 POKEV,24:POKEV+1,50:POKEV+16,0
  60 POKEV+2,34:POKEV+3,60
  70 POKEV+4,44:POKEV+5,70


  You should see a white sprite on top of a yellow sprite on top of an
  orange sprite. Of course, now that you see how priorities work, you can
  also MOVE SPRITES and take advantage of these priorities in your ani-
  mation."

"In the context of the C64, What forms of data storage do floppy diskettes allow?","DATA STORAGE ON FLOPPY DISKETTES

    Diskettes allow 3 different forms of data storage. Sequential files are
  similar to those on tape, but several can can be used at the same time.
  Relative files let you organize the data into records, and then read and
  replace individual records within the file. Random files let you work
  with data anywhere on the disk. They are organized into 256 byte sections
  called blocks.
    The PRINT# statement's limitations are discussed in the section on
  cassette tape. The same limitations to format apply on the disk. RETURNs
  or commas are needed to separate your data. The CHR$(0) is still read by
  the GET# statement as an empty string.
    Relative and random files both make use of separate data and command
  'channels.' Data written to the disk goes through the data channel, where
  it is stored in a temporary buffer in the disk's RAM. When the record or
  block is complete, a command is sent through the command channel that
  tells the drive where to put the data, and the entire buffer is written.
    Applications that require large amounts of data to be processed are
  best stored in relative disk files. These will use the least amount of
  time and provide the best flexibility for the programmer. Your disk drive
  manual gives a complete programming guide to use of disk files."

    Description: This routine saves a section of memory. Memory is saved
  from an indirect address on page 0 specified by the accumulator to the
  address stored in the X and Y registers. It is then sent to a logical
  file on an input/output device. The SETLFS and SETNAM routines must be
  used before calling this routine. However, a file name is not required to
  SAVE to device 1 (the Datassette(TM) recorder). Any attempt to save to
  other devices without using a file name results in an error.

  
  NOTE: Device 0 (the keyboard), device 2 (RS-232), and device 3 (the

  time to develop might no longer work, forcing major revisions in the
  program. To alleviate this problem, Commodore has developed a method of
  protecting software writers called the KERNAL.
    Essentially, the KERNAL is a standardized JUMP TABLE to the input,
  output, and memory management routines in the operating system. The
  locations of each routine in ROM may change as the system is upgraded.
  But the KERNAL jump table will always be changed to match. If your
  machine language routines only use the system ROM routines through the
  KERNAL, it will take much less work to modify them, should that need ever
  arise.
    The KERNAL is the operating system of the Commodore 64 computer. All
  input, output, and memory management is controlled by the KERNAL.
    To simplify the machine language programs you write, and to make sure
  that future versions of the Commodore 64 operating system don't make your
  machine language programs obsolete, the KERNAL contains a jump table for
  you to use. By taking advantage of the 39 input/output routines and other
  utilities available to you from the table, not only do you save time, you
  also make it easier to translate your programs from one Commodore
  computer to another.
    The jump table is located on the last page of memory, in read-only
  memory (ROM).
    To use the KERNAL jump table, first you set up the parameters that the
  KERNAL routine needs to work. Then JSR (Jump to SubRoutine) to the proper
  place in the KERNAL jump table. After performing its function, the KERNAL
  transfers control back to your machine language program. Depending on
  which KERNAL routine you are using, certain registers may pass parameters
  back to your program. The particular registers for each KERNAL routine
  may be found in the individual descriptions of the KERNAL subroutines.

    A good question at this point is why use the jump table at all? Why not
  just JSR directly to the KERNAL subroutine involved? The jump table is
  used so that if the KERNAL or BASIC is changed, your machine language
  programs will still work. In future operating systems the routines may
  have their memory locations moved around to a different position in the
  memory map... but the jump table will still work correctly!"
"In the context of the C64, What is 64Mon?","64MON

    The 64MON cartridge available from your local dealer, is a program that
  allows you to escape from the world of CBM BASIC, into the land of
  machine language. It can display the contents of the internal registers
  in the 6510 microprocessor, and it allows you to display portions of mem-
  ory, and change them on the screen, using the screen editor. It also has
  a built-in assembler and disassembler, as well as many other features
  that allow you to write and edit machine language programs easily. You
  don't HAVE to use an assembler to write machine language, but the task is
  considerably easier with it. If you wish to write machine language
  programs, it is strongly suggested that you purchase an assembler of some
  sort. Without an assembler you will probably have to 'POKE' the machine
  language program into memory, which is totally unadvisable. This manual
  will give its examples in the format that 64MON uses, from now on. Nearly
  all assembler formats are the same, therefore the machine language
  examples shown will almost certainly be compatible with any assembler.
  But before explaining any of the other features of 64MON, the hexadecimal
  numbering system must be explained."

"In the context of the C64, What are some important considerations when setting sprite pointer settings in RAM memory?","DIFFERENT SPRITE POINTER SETTINGS:

    These sprite pointer settings are RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY.
    Caution: you can set your sprite pointers anywhere in RAM memory but if
  you set them too 'low' in memory a long BASIC program may overwrite your
  sprite data, or vice versa. To protect an especially LONG BASIC PROGRAM
  from overwriting sprite data, you may want to set the sprites at a higher
  area of memory (for example, 2040,192 for sprite 0 at locations 12288 to
  12350... 2041,193 at locations 12352 to 12414 for sprite 1 and so on...
  by adjusting the memory locations from which sprites get their 'data,'
  you can define as many as 64 different sprites plus a sizable BASIC
  program. To do this, define several sprite 'shapes' in your DATA
  statements and then redefine a particular sprite by changing the
  'pointer' so the sprite you are using is 'pointed' at different areas of
  memory containing different sprite picture data. See the 'Dancing Mouse'
  to see how this works. If you want two or more sprites to have THE SAME
  SHAPE (you can still change position and color of each sprite), use the
  same sprite pointer and memory location for the sprites you want to match
  (for example, you can point sprites 0 and 1 to the same location by using
  POKE 2040,192 and POKE 2041, 192)."

"In the context of the C64, Ho do you position a sprite on the screen?","POSITIONING SPRITES ON THE SCREEN

    The entire display screen is divided into a grid of X and Y coordi-
  nates, like a graph. The X COORDINATE is the HORIZONTAL position across
  the screen and the Y COORDINATE is the VERTICAL position up and down (see
  Figure 3-4).
    To position any sprite on the screen, you must POKE TWO SETTINGS...
  the X position and the Y position... these tell the computer where to
  display the UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER of the sprite. Remember that a sprite
  consists of 504 individual pixels, 24 across by 21 down... so if you POKE
  a sprite onto the upper left corner of your screen, the sprite will be
  displayed as a graphic image 24 pixels ACROSS and 21 pixels DOWN starting
  at the X-Y position you defined. The sprite will be displayed based on
  the upper left corner of the entire sprite, even if you define the sprite
  using only a small part of the 24X21-pixel sprite area.
    To understand how X-Y positioning works, study the following diagram
  (Figure 3-5), which shows the X and Y numbers in relation to your display
  screen. Note that the GREY AREA in the diagram shows your television
  viewing area... the white area represents positions which are OFF your
  viewing screen...

"In the context of the C64, What is the step-by-step guide for creating a sprite?","CREATING A SPRITE... STEP BY STEP

    To make this as easy as possible for you, we've put together this
  simple step by step guide to help you draw your own sprites.

  STEP 1:

  Write the spritemaking program shown here ON A PIECE OF PAPER... note
  that line 100 starts a special DATA section of your program which will
  contain the 63 numbers you need to create your sprite.

  STEP 2:

  Color in the pixels on the spritemaking grid on Page 162 (or use a piece
  of graph paper... remember, a sprite has 24 squares across and 21 squares
  down). We suggest you use a pencil and draw lightly so you can reuse this
  grid. You can create any image you like, but for our example we'll draw
  a simple box.

  STEP 3:

  Look at the first EIGHT pixels. Each column of pixels has a number (128,
  64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). The special type of addition we are going to
  show you is a type of BINARY ARITHMETIC which is used by most computers
  as a special way of counting. 
  STEP 4:

  Add up the numbers of the SOLID pixels. This first group of eight pixels
  is completely solid, so the total number is 255.

  STEP 5:

  Enter that number as the FIRST DATA STATEMENT in line 100 of the
  Spritemaking Program below. Enter 255 for the second and third groups
  of eight.

  STEP 6:

  Look at the FIRST EIGHT PIXELS IN THE SECOND ROW of the sprite. Add up
  the values of the solid pixels. Since only one of these pixels is solid,
  the total value is 128. Enter this as the first DATA number in line 101.


  STEP 7:

  Add up the values of the next group of eight pixels (which is 0 because
  they're all BLANK) and enter in line 101. Now move to the next group of
  pixels and repeat the process for each GROUP OF EIGHT PIXELS (there are
  3 groups across each row, and 21 rows). This will give you a total of 63
  numbers. Each number represents ONE group of 8 pixels, and 63 groups of
  eight equals 504 total individual pixels. Perhaps a better way of looking
  at the program is like this... each line in the program represents ONE
  ROW in the sprite. Each of the 3 numbers in each row represents ONE GROUP
  OF EIGHT PIXELS. And each number tells the computer which pixels to make
  SOLID and which pixels to leave blank.

  STEP 8:

  CRUNCH YOUR PROGRAM INTO A SMALLER SPACE BY RUNNING TOGETHER ALL THE DATA
  STATEMENTS, AS SHOWN IN THE SAMPLE PROGRAM BELOW. Note that we asked you
  to write your sprite program on a piece of paper. We did this for a good
  reason. The DATA STATEMENT LINES 100-120 in the program in STEP 1 are
  only there to help you see which numbers relate to which groups of pixels
  in your sprite. Your final program should be 'crunched' like this:

"In the context of the C64, What is the priority of a sprite that will always appear in front of or on top of all other sprites?","SPRITE PRIORITY:

    Priority means one sprite will appear to move 'in front of' or 'behind'

  appear to move 'in front of' or 'on top of' sprites with less priority.
  The rule is that lower numbered sprites have priority over higher
  numbered sprites. Sprite 0 has priority over all other sprites. Sprite 7
  has no priority in relation to the other sprites. Sprite 1 has priority
  over sprites 2-7, etc. If you put two sprites in the some position, the

  the lower priority. The sprite with lower priority will either be
  obscured, or will 'show through' (from 'behind') the sprite with higher
  priority."

"In the context of the C64, Can you talk about the C64 memory management?","MEMORY MANAGEMENT ON THE
  COMMODORE 64

    The Commodore 64 has 64K bytes of RAM. It also has 20K bytes of ROM,
  containing BASIC, the operating system, and the standard character set.
  It also accesses input/output devices as a 4K chunk of memory. How is
  this all possible on a computer with a 16-bit address bus, that is
  normally only capable of addressing 64K?
    The secret is in the 6510 processor chip itself. On the chip is an
  input/output port. This port is used to control whether RAM or ROM or I/O
  will appear in certain portions of the system's memory. The port is also
  used to control the Datassette(TM), so it is important to affect only the
  proper bits.
    The 6510 input/output port appears at location 1. The data direction
  register for this port appears at location 0. The port is controlled like
  any of the other input/output ports in the system... the data direction
  controls whether a given bit will be an input or an output, and the
  actual data transfer occurs through the port itself. The lines in the
  6510 control port are defined as follows:


  |  NAME   |BIT| DIRECTION  |                 DESCRIPTION                |
  |  LORAM  | 0 |   OUTPUT   | Control for RAM/ROM at $A000-$BFFF         |
  |  HIRAM  | 1 |   OUTPUT   | Control for RAM/ROM at $E000-$FFFF         |
  |  CHAREN | 2 |   OUTPUT   | Control for I/O/ROM at $D000-$DFFF         |
  |         | 3 |   OUTPUT   | Cassette write line                        |
  |         | 4 |   INPUT    | Cassette switch sense (0=play button down) |
  |         | 5 |   OUTPUT   | Cassette motor control (0=motor spins)     |


    The proper value for the data direction register is as follows:

                              BITS 5 4 3 2 1 0
                              ----------------
                                   1 0 1 1 1 1

  (where 1 is an output, and 0 is an input).

    This gives a value of 47 decimal. The Commodore 64 automatically sets
  the data direction register to this value.
    The control lines, in general, perform the function given in their de-
  scriptions. However, a combination of control lines are occasionally used
  to get a particular memory configuration.
    LORAM (bit 0) can generally be thought of as a control line which banks
  the 8K byte BASIC ROM in and out of the microprocessor address space.
  Normally, this line is HIGH for BASIC operation. If this line is
  programmed LOW, the BASIC ROM will disappear from the memory map and be
  replaced by 8K bytes of RAM from $A000-$BFFF.
    HIRAM (bit 1) can generally be thought of as a control line which banks
  the 8K byte KERNAL ROM in and out of the microprocessor address space.
  Normally, this line is HIGH for BASIC operation. If this line is
  programmed LOW, the KERNAL ROM will disappear from the memory map and be
  replaced by 8K bytes of RAM from $E000-$FFFF.
    CHAREN (bit 2) is used only to bank the 4K byte character generator ROM
  in or out of the microprocessor address space. From the processor point
  of view, the character ROM occupies the same address space as the I/O
  devices ($D000-$DFFF). When the CHAREN line is set to 1 (as is normal),
  the I/O devices appear in the microprocessor address space, and the
  character ROM is not accessable. When the CHAREN bit is cleared to 0, the
  character ROM appears in the processor address space, and the I/O devices
  are not accessable. (The microprocessor only needs to access the
  character ROM when downloading the character set from ROM to RAM. Special
  care is needed for this... see the section on PROGRAMMABLE CHARACTERS in
  the GRAPHICS chapter). CHAREN can be overridden by other control lines in
  certain memory configurations. CHAREN will have no effect on any memory
  configuration without I/O devices. RAM will appear from $D000-$DFFF
  instead.


  | NOTE: In any memory map containing ROM, a WRITE (a POKE) to a ROM     |
  | location will store data in the RAM 'under' the ROM. Writing to a ROM |
  | location stores data in the 'hidden' RAM. For example, this allows a  |
  | hi-resolution screen to be kept underneath a ROM, and be changed      |
  | without having to bank the screen back into the processor address     |
  | space. Of course a READ of a ROM location will return the contents of |
  | the ROM, not the 'hidden' RAM.                                        |"

  can be any valid memory address in the system where a string of
  characters for the file name is stored. If no file name is desired, the
  accumulator must be set to 0, representing a zero file length. The X and
  Y registers can be set to any memory address in that case.

  How to Use:

    1) Load the accumulator with the length of the file name.

    3) Load the Y index register with the high order address.

Current Foreground Color for Text

The process of PRINTing a character to the screen consists of both
placing the screen code value for the character in screen memory and
placing a foreground color value in the corresponding location in
color RAM.  Whenever a character is PRINTed, the Operating System
fetches the value to be put in color RAM from this location.

The foreground color may be changed in a number of ways.  Pressing the
CTRL or Commodore logo key and numbers 1-8 at the same time will
change the value stored here, and thus the color being printed.
PRINTing the PETASCII equivalent character with the CHR$ command will
have the same effect.  But probably the easiest method is to POKE the
color value directly to this location.  The table below lists the
possible colors that may be produced, and shows how to produce them

PAL/NTSC Flag

At power-on, a test is performed to see if the monitor uses the NTSC
(North American) or PAL (European) television standard.

This test is accomplished by setting a raster interrupt for scan line
311, and testing if the interrupt occurs.  Since NTSC monitors have
only 262 raster scan lines per screen, the interrupt will occur only
if a PAL monitor is used.  The results of that test are stored here,
with a 0 indicating an NTSC system in use, and one signifying a PAL
system.

This information is used by the routines which set the prescaler
values for the system IRQ timer, so that the IRQ occurs every 1/60
second.  Since the PAL system 02 clock runs a bit slower than the NTSC
version, this prescaler value must be adjusted accordingly."

Address of USR Routine (Low Byte First)

These locations contain the target address of the USR command.  They
are initialized by the Operating System to point to the BASIC error
message handler routine, so that if you try to execute a USR call
without changing these values, you wil receive an ILLEGAL QUANTITY
error message.

In order to successfully execute a USR call, you must first POKE in
the target address in low-byte, high-byte order.  You can calculate
these two values for any address with the formula:

HI=INT(AD/256):LO=AD-(HI*256)

For example, if the USR routine started at 49152 ($C000), you would
POKE 786, INT(49152/256):POKE 785,49152-(PEEK(786)*256 before
executing the USR command.

What makes the USR command different from SYS is that you can pass a
parameter into the machine language routine by placing it in
parenthesis after the USR keyword, and you can pass a parameter back
to a variable by assigning its value to the USR function.

In other words, the statement X=USR(50) will first put the number 50
in floating point format into the Floating Point Accumulator (FAC1) at
97-102 ($61-$66).  Then, the machine language program designated by
the address at this vector will be executed.  Finally, the variable X
will be assigned the floating point value which ends up in FAC1 after
the user-written routine is finished.

Since floating point representation is difficult to work with, it is
handy to change these floating point parameters into integers before
working with them.  Fortunately, there are vectored routines which
will do the conversions for you.  The routine vectored at locations
3-4 converts the number in FAC1 to a two-byte signed integer, with the
low byte in the .Y register (and location 101 ($65)) and the high byte
in the Accumulator (.A).  Remember, that number is converted to a
signed integer in the range between 32767 and -32768, with Bit 7 of
the high byte used to indicate the sign.

To pass a value back through the USR function, you need to place the
number into FAC1.  To conert a signed integer to floating point
format, place the high byte into the Accumulator (.A), the low byte
into the .Y register, and jump through the vector at locations 5-6
with a JMP ($0005) instruction.  The floating point result will be
left in FAC1."

Bit 6:  Enable extended color text mode (1=enable)
Bit 7:  High bit (Bit 8) of raster compare register at 53266 ($D012)

This is one of the two important multifunction control registers on
the VIC-II chip.  Its defaule value is 155, which sets the high bit of
the raster compare to 1, selects a 25-row display, disables the
blanking feature, and uses a vertical scrolling offset of three scan
lines.

Bits 0-2.  These bits control vertical fine scrolling of the screen
display.  This feature allows you to move the entire text display
smoothly up and down, enabling the display area to act as a window,
scrolling over a larger text or character graphics display.

Since each row of text is eight scan lines high, if you simply move
each line of text up one row, the characters travel an appreciable
distance each time they move, which gives the motion a jerky quality.
This is called coarse scrolling, and you can see an example of it when
LISTing a program that is too long to fit on the screen all at one
time.

By placing a number from 1 to 7 into these three bits, you can move
the whole screen display down by from 1 to 7 dot spaces.  Stepping
through the values 1 to 7 allows you to smoothly make the transition
from having a character appear in one row on the screen to having it
appear in the next row.  To demonstrate this, type in the following
sample program, LIST it, and RUN.

10 FOR I= 1 TO 50:FOR J=0 TO 7
20 POKE 53265, (PEEK(53265)AND248) OR J:NEXTJ,I
30 FOR I= 1 TO 50:FOR J=7 TO 0 STEP-1
40 POKE 53265, (PEEK(53265)AND248) OR J:NEXTJ,I

As you can see, after the display has moved seven dot positions up or
down, it starts over at its original position.  In order to continue
the scroll, you must do a coarse scroll every time the value of the
scroll bits goes from 7 to 0, or from 0 to 7.  This is accomplished by
moving the display data for each line by 40 bytes in either direction,
overwriting the data for the last line, and introducing a line of data
at the opposite end of screen memory to replace it.  Obviously, ony a
machine language program can move all of these lines quickly enough to
maintain the effect of smooth motion.  The following BASIC program,
however, will give you an iea of what vertical fine scrolling is like:

10 POKE 53281,0:PRINTCHR$(5);CHR$(147)
20 FORI=1 TO 27:
30 PRINTTAB(15)CHR$(145)'            ':POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND248
40 WAIT53265,128:PRINTTAB(15)'I'M FALLING'
50 FOR J=1 TO 7
60 POKE53265,(PEEK(53265)AND248)+J
70 FORK=1TO50
80 NEXT K,J,I:RUN

Bit 3.  This bit register allows you to select either the normal
25-line text display (by setting the bit to 1), or a shortened 24-row
display (by resetting that bit to 0).  This shortened display is
created by extending the border to overlap the top or bottom row.  The
characters in these rows are still there; they are just covered up.

The shortened display is designed to aid vertical fine scrolling.  It
covers up the line into which new screen data is introduced, so that
the viewer does not see the new data being moved into place.

However, unlink the register at 53270 ($D016) which shortens the
screen by one character space on either side to aid horizontal
scrolling in either direction, this register can blank only one
vertical line at a time.  In order to compensate, it blanks the top
line when the three scroll bits in this register are set to 0, and
shifts the blanking one scan line at a time as the value of thee bits
increases.  Thus the bottom line is totally blanked when these bits
are set to 7.

Bit 4.  Bit 4 of this register controls the screen blanking feature.
When this bit is set to 0, no data can be displayed on the screen.
Instead, the whole screen will be filled with the color of the frame
(which is controlled by th eBorder Color Register at 53280 ($D020)).

Screen blanking is useful because of the way in which the VIC-II chip
interacts with the 6510 microprocessor.  Since the VIC-II and the 6510
both have to address the same memory, they must share the system data
bus.  Sharing the data bus means that they must take turns whenever
they want to address memory.

The VIC-II chip was designed so that it fetches most of the data it
needs during the part of the cycle in which the 6510 is not using the
data bus.  But certain operations, such as reading the 40 screen codes
needed for each line of text from video mmeory, or fetching sprite
data, require that the VIC-II chip get data at a faster rate than is
possible just by using the off half of the 6510 cycle.

Thus, the VIC-II chip must delay the 6510 for a short amount of time
while it is using the data bus to gather display information for text
or bitmap graphics, and must delay it a little more if sprites are
also enabled.  When you set the screen blanking bit to 0, these delays
are eliminated, and the 6510 processor is allowed to run at its full
speed.  This speeds up any processing task a little.

To demonstrate this, run the following short program.  As you will
see, leaving the screen on makes the processor run about 7 percent
slower than when you turn it off.  If you perform the same timing test
on the VIC-20, you will find that it runs at the same speed with its
screen on as the 64 does with its screen off.  And the same test on a
PET will run substantially slower.

10 PRINT CHR$(147);TAB(13);'TIMING TEST':PRINT:TI$='000000':GOTO 30
20 FOR I=1 TO 10000:NEXT I:RETURN
30 GOSUB 20:DISPLAY=TI
40 POKE 53265,11:TI$='000000'
50 GOSUB 20:NOSCREEN=TI:POKE 53265,27
60 PRINT 'THE LOOP TOOK';DISPLAY;' JIFFIES'
70 PRINT 'WITH NO SCREEN BLANKING':PRINT
80 PRINT 'THE LOOP TOOK';NOSCREEN;' JIFFIES'
90 PRINT 'WITH SCREEN BLANKING':PRINT
100 PRINT 'SCREEN BLANKING MAKE THE PROCESSOR'
110 PRINT 'GO';DISPLAY/NOSCREEN*100-100;'PERCENT FASTER'

The above explanation accounts for the screen being turned off during
tape read and write operations.  The timing of these operations is
rather critical, and would be affected by even the relatively small
delay caused by the video chip.  It also explains why the 64 has
difficulty loading programs from an unmodified 1540 Disk Drive, since
the 1540 was set up to transfer data from the VIC-20, which does not
have to contend with these slight delays.

If you turn off the 64 display with a POKE 53265,PEEEK(53265) AND 239,
you will be able to load programs correctly from an old 1540 drive.
The new 1541 drive transfers data at a slightly slower rate in the
default setting, and can be set from software to transfer it at the
higher rate for the VIC-20.

Bit 5.  Setting Bit 5 of this register to 1 enables the bitmap
graphics mode.  In this mode, the screen area is broken down into
64,000 separate dots of light, 320 dots across by 200 dots high.  Each
dot corresponds to one bit of display memory.  If the bit is set to 1,
the dot will be displayed in the foreground color.  If the bit is
reset to 0, it will be displayed in the background color.  This allows
the display of high-resolution graphics images for games, charts, and
graphs, etc.

Bitmapping is a common technique for implementing high-resolution
graphics on a microcomputer.  There are some features of the Commodore
system which are unusual, however.

Most systems display screen memory sequentially; that is, the first
byte controls the display of the first eight dots in the upper-left
corner of the screen, the second byte controls the eight dots to the
right of that, etc.  In the Commodore system, display memory is laid
out more along the lines of how character graphics dot-data is
arranged.

The first byte controls the row of eight dots in the top-left corner
of the screen, but the next byte controls the eight dots below that,
and so on until the ninth byte.  The ninth byte controls the eight
dots directly to the right of those controlled by the first byte of
display memory.  It is exactly the same as if the screen were filled
with 1000 programmable characters, with display memory taking the
place of the character dot-data.

The 64's bitmap graphics mode also resembles character graphics in
that the foreground color of the dots is set by a color map (although
it does not use the Color RAM for this purpose).  Four bits of each
byte of this color memory control the foreground color of one of these
eight-byte groups of display memory (which form an 8 by 8 grid of 64
dots).  Unlike character graphics, however, the other four bits
control the background color that will be seen in the eight-byte
display group where a bit has a value of 0.

Setting up a bitmap graphics screen is somewhat more complicated than
just setting this register bit to 1.  You must first choose a location
for the display memory area, and for the color memory area.  The
display memory area will be 8192 bytes long (8000 of which are
actually used for the display) and can occupy only the first or the
second half of the 16K space which the VIC-II chip can address.

Each byte of bitmap graphics color memory uses four bits for the
background color as well as four bits for the foreground color.
Therefore, the Color RAM nybbles at 55296 ($D800), which are wired for
four bits only, cannot be used.  Another RAM location must therefore
be found for color memory.

This color memory area will take up 1K (1000 bytes of which are
actually used to control the foreground and background colors of the
dots), and must be in the opposite half of VIC-II memory as the
display data.  Since bitmap graphics require so much memory for the
display, you may want to select a different 16K bank for VIC-II memory
(see the discussion of things to consider in selecting a VIC-II memory
bank at location 56576 ($DD00)).

To keep things simple, however, let's assume that you have selected to
use the default bank of VIC-II memory, which is the first 16K.  You
would have to select locations 8192-16383 ($2000-$3FFF) for screen
memory, because the VIC-II chip sees an image of the character ROM in
the first half of the 16K block (at locations 4096-8192
($1000-$1FFF)).  Color memory could be placed at the default location
of text display memory, at 1024-2047 ($400-$7FF).  Placement of bitmap
display and color memory is controlled by the VIC Memory Control
Register at 53272 ($D018).

When in bitmap mode, the lower four bits of this register, which
normally control the base address of character dot-data, now control
the location of the 8K bitmap.  Only Bit 3 is significant.  If it is
set to 1, the graphics display memory will be in the second 8K of
VIC-II memory (in this case, starting at 8192 ($2000)).  If that bit
contains a 0, the first 8K will be used for the bitmap.  The upper
four bits of this register, which normally control the location of the
Video Display Matrix, are used in bitmap mode to establish the
location of the color map within the VIC-II address space.  These four
bits can hold a number from 0 to 15, which indicates on which 1K
boundary the color map begins.  For example, if color memory began at
1024 (1K), the value of these four bits would be 0001.

Once the bitmap mode has been selected, and the screen and color
memory areas set up, you must establish a method for turning each
individual dot on and off.  The conventional method for identifying
each dot is to assign it to a horizontal (X) position coordinate and a
vertical (Y) coordinate.

Horizontal position values will range from 0 to 319, where dot 0 is at
the extreme left-hand side of the screen, and dot 319 at the extreme
right.  Vertical positions will range from 0 to 199, where dot 0 is on
the top line, and dot 199 is on the bottom line.

Because of the unusual layout of bitmap screen data on the 64, it is
fairly easy to transfer text characters to a bitmap screen, but it is
somewhat awkward finding the bit which affects the screen dot having a
given X-Y coordinate.  First, you must find the byte BY in which the
bit resides, and then you must POKE a vlue into that byte which turns
the desired bit on or off.  Given that the horizontal position of the
dot is stored in the variable X, its vertical position is in the
variable Y, and the base address of the bitmap area is in the variable
BASE, you can find the desired byte with the formula:

BY=BASE+40*(Y AND 256)+(Y AND 7)+(X AND 504)

To turn on the desired dot,

POKE BY, PEEK(BY) OR (2^(NOTX AND 7)

To turn the dot off,

POKE BY, PEEK(BY) AND (255-2^(NOTX AND 7))

The exponentation function takes a lot of time.  To speed things up,
an array can be created, each of whose elements corresponds to a power
of two.

FOR I=0 TO 7:BIT(I)=2^1:NEXT

After this is done, the expression 2^(I) can be replaced by BI(I).

The following sample program illustrates the bit-graphics concepts
explained above, and serves as a summary of that information.

As you can see, using BASIC to draw in bit-graphics mode is somewhat
slow and tedious.  Machine language is much more suiable for
bit-graphics plotting.  For a program that lets you replace some BASIC
ommands with high-res drawing commands, see the article 'Hi-Res
Graphics Made Simple,' by Paul F. Schatz, in COMPUTE!'s First Book of
Commodore 64 Sound and Graphics.

There is a slightly lower resolution bitmap graphics mode available
which offers up to four colors per 8 by 8 dot matrix.  To enable this
mode, you must set the multicolor bit (Bit 4 of 53270 ($D016)) while
in bitmap graphics mode.  For more information on this mode, see the
entry for the multicolor enable bit.

Bit 6.  This bit of this register enables extended background color
mode.  This mode lets you select the background color of each text
character, as well as its foreground color.  It is able to increase
the number of background colors displayed, by reducing the number of
characters that can be shown on the screen.

Normally, 256 character shapes can be displayed on the screen.  You
can use them either by using the PRINT statement or by POKEing a
display code from 0 to 255 into screen memory.  If the POKEing method
is used, you must also POKE a color code from 0 to 15 into color
memory (for example, if you POKE 1024,1, and POKE 55296,1, a white A
appears in the top-left corner of the screen).

The background color of the screen is determined by Background Color
Register 0, and you can change this color by POKEing a new value to
that register, which is located at 53281 ($D021).  For example, POKE
53281,0 creates a black background.

When extended background color mode is activated, however, only the
first 64 shapes found in the table of the screen display codes can be
displayed on the screen.  This group includes the letters of the
alphabet, numerals, and punctuation marks.  If you try to print on the
screen a character having a higher display code, the shape displayed
will be from the first group of 64, but that character's background
will no longer be determined by the register at 53281 ($D021).
Instead, it will be determined by one of the other background color
registers.

When in extended background color mode, characters having display
codes 64- 127 will take their background color from register 1, and
location 53282 ($D022).  These characters include various SHIFTed
characters.  Those with codes 128-191 will have their background
colors determined by register 2, at 53283 ($D023).  These include the
reversed numbers, letters, and punctuation marks.  Finally, characters
with codes 192-255 will use register 4, at 53284 ($D024).  These are
the reversed graphics characters.

Let's try an experiment to see just how this works.  First, we will
put the codes for four different letters in screen memory:

FOR I=0 TO 3:POKE 1230+(I*8),I*64+I:POKE 55502+(I*8),1:NEXT

Four white letters should appear on the screen, an A, a shifted A, a
reversed A, and a reversed, shifted A, all on a blue background.
Next, we will put colors in the other background color registers:

POKE 53282,0:POKE53283,2:POKE53284,5

This sets the registers to black, red, and green, respectively.
Finally, we will activate extended color mode by setting Bit 6 of the
VIC-II register at location 53265 to a 1.  The BASIC statement that
turns this mode on is:

POKE 53265,PEEK(53265) OR 64

Notice that two things happened.  First, all of the letters took on
the same shape, that of the letter A.  Second, each took on the
background color of a different color register.  To get things back to
normal, turn off extended color mode with this statement:

POKE 53265,PEEK(53265) AND 191

Extended color mode can be a very useful enhancement for your text
displays.  It allows the creation of windows.  These windows, because
of their different background colors, make different bodies of text
stand out as visually distinct from one another.  For example, a text
adventure program could have one window to display the player's
current location, one to show an inventory of possessions, and one to
accept commands for the next move.

In this mode the background color of these windows can be changed
instantly, just by POKEing a new value to the color register.  This
technique lends itself to some dramatic effects.  A window can be
flashed to draw attention to a particular message at certain times.
And varying the foreground color can make either the window or the
message vanish and reappear later.

There are, however, a couple of problems involved in using these
windows.  The character shape that you want to use might not have a
screen code of less than 64.  In that case, the only solution is to
define your own character set, with the shape you want in one of the
first 64 characters.

Another problem is that characters within a PRINT statement in your
program listing are not always going to look the same on the screen.
Having to figure out what letter to print to get the number 4 with a
certain background color can be very inconvenient.  The easiest
solution to this problem is to have a subroutine to the translation
for you.  Since letters will appear normally in window 1, and window 3
characters are simply window 1 characters reversed, you will only have
problems with characters in windows 2 and 4.  To conver these
characters, put your message in A$, and use the following subroutine:

500 B$='':FOR I=1 TO LEN(A$):B=ASC(MID$(A$,I,1))
510 B=B+32:IF B<96 THEN B=B+96
520 B$=B$+CHR$(B):NEXT I:RETURN

This subroutine converts each letter to its ASCII equivalent, adds the
proper offset, and converts it back to part of the new string, B$.
When the conversion is complete, B$ will hold the characters necessary
to PRINT that message in window 2.  For window 4, PRINT
CHR$(18);B$;CHR$(146).  This will turn reverse video on before
printing the string, and turn it off afterwards.



Bit 7.  Bit 7 of this register is the high-order bit (Bit 8) of the
Raster Compare register at 53266 ($D012).  Even though it is located
here, it functions as part of that register (see the description below
for more information on the Raster Compare register).

Machine language programmers should note that its position here at Bit
7 allows testing this bit with the Negative flag.  Since scan lines
above number 256 are all off the screen, this provides an easy way to
delay changing the graphics display until the scan is in the vertical
blanking interval and the display is no longer being drawn:

LOOP  LDA $D011
      BPL LOOP

Sprites should always be moved when the raster is scanning off-screen,
because if they are moved while they are being scanned, their shapes
will waver slightly.

The BASIC equivalent of the program fragment above is the statement
WAIT 53265,128, but BASIC is usually not fast enough to execute the
next statement while still in the blanking interval.

53266          $D012         RASTER
Read Current Raster Scan Line/Write Line to Compare for Raster IRQ

The Raster Compare register has two different functions, depending on
whether you are reading from it or writing to it.  When this register
is read, it tells which screen line the electron beam is currently
scanning.

There are 262 horizontal lines which make up the American (NTSC)
standard display screen (312 lines in the European or PAL standard
screen).  Every one of these lines is scanned and updated 60 times per
second.  Only 200 of these lines (numbers 50-249) are part of the
visible display.

It is sometimes helpful to know just what line is being scanned,
because changing screen graphics on a particular line while that line
is being scanned may cause a slight disruption on the screen.  By
reading this register, it is possible for a machine language program
to wait until the scan is off the bottom of the screen before changing
the graphics display.

It is even possible for a machine language program to read this
register, and change the screen display when a certain scan line is
reached.  The program below uses this technique to change the
background color in midscreen, in order to show all 256 combinations
of foreground and background text colors at once.

Writing to this register designates the comparison value for the
Raster Compare Interrupt.  When that interrupt is enabled, a maskable
interrupt request will be issued every time the electron beam scan
reaches the scan line whose number was written here.  This is a much
more flexible technique for changing the display in midscreen than
reading this register as the sample program above does.  That
technique requires that the program continuously watch the Raster
Register, while the interrupt method will call the program when the
time is right to act.  For more information on raster interrupts, see
the entry for the Interrupt Mask Register (53274, $D01A).

It is very important to remember that this register requires nine
bits, and that this location only holds eight of those bits (the ninth
is Bit 7 of 53265 ($D011)).  If you forget to read or write to the
ninth bit, your results could be in error by a factor of 256.

For example, some early programs written to demonstrate the raster
interrupt took for granted that the ninth bit of this register would
be set to 0 on power-up.  When a later version of the Kernal changed
this initial value to a 1, their interrupt routines, which were
supposed to set the raster interrupt to occur at scan line number 150,
ended up setting it for line number 406 instead.  Since the scan line
numbers do not go up that high, no interrupt request was ever issued
and the program did not work.

Location Range: 53267-53268 ($D013-$D014)
Light Pen Registers

A light pen is an input device that can be plugged into joystick
Control Port #1.  It is shaped like a pen and has a light-sensitive
device at its tip that causes the trigger switch of the joystick port
to close at the moment the electron beam that updates the screen
display strikes it.  The VIC-II chip keeps track of where the beam is
when that happens, and records the corresponding horizontal and
vertical screen coordinates in the registers at these locations.

A program can read the position at which the light pen is held up to
the screen.  The values in these registers are updated once every
screen frame (60 times per second).  Once the switch is closed and a
value written to these registers, the registers are latched, and
subsequent switch closings during the same screen frame will not be
recorded.

A given light pen may not be entirely accurate (and the operator may
not have a steady hand).  It is probably wise to average the positions
returned from a number of samplings, particularly when using a machine
language driver."

Voice 1 Pulse Waveform Width Control

As you will see below under the description of the Control Register at
54276 ($D404), you can select one of four different waveforms for the
output of each voice.  If the pulse waveform is selected, these
registers must be set to establish the pulse width.

The pulse width has a 12-bit resolution, being made up of the value in
the first register and the value in the lower nybble of the second
register.  The pulse width determines the duty cycle, or proportion of
the time that the rectangular wave will stay at the high part of the
cycle.

The following formula shows the relationship between the value in the
Pulse Width Register and the proportion of time that the wave stays at
the high part of the cycle:

PULSE WIDTH=(REGISTER VALUE/40.95)%

The possible range of the register values (0-4095) covers the range of
the duty cycles from 0 to 100 percent in 4096 steps.  Changing the
pulse width will vastly change the sound created with the pulse
waveform."

RS-232: Mock 6551 Command Register

This location performs the same function as the 6551 UART chip's
command register, which specifies type of parity, duplex mode, and
handshaking protocol.

The type of parity used determines how the 64 will check that RS-232
data is received correctly.

The duplex mode can be either full duplex (the 64 will be able to
transmit at the same time it is receiving) or half duplex (it will
take turns sending and receiving).

The handshaking protocol has to do with the manner in which the
sending device lets the receiver know that it is ready to send data,
and the receiver lets the sender know that it has gotten the data
correctly.  The meanings of the bit patterns in this register are as
follows:

Bits 7-5: Parity
XX0 (bit value of
     0,64,128, or 192) = No Parity Generated or Received
001 (bit value of 32)  = Odd Parity Transmitted and Received
011 (bit value of 96)  = Even Parity Transmitted and Received
101 (bit value of 160) = Mark Parity Transmitted and Received
111 (bit value of 224) = Space Parity Transmitted and Received

Bit 4: Duplex
0 (bit value of 0)  = Full Duplex
1 (bit value of 16) = Half Duplex

Bits 3-1: Unused

Bit 0: Handshake Protocol
0 (bit value of 0) = 3 Line
1 (bit value of 1) = X Line

This register can be set at the user's option when opening RS-232
device (number 2).  The second character of the filename will be
stored here.  For example, the statement

OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(6+32)+CHR$(32+16)

will set the value of this location to 48, which is the value of the
second character in the filename portion of the statement.  As you can
see from the above chart, this configures the RS-232 device for half
duplex data transfer using odd parity and three-line handshaking."

FOR is performed mostly by saving the needed information for the NEXT

and you cannot end the loop early by decreasing the value of the TO
variable within the loop (although you can end it early by increasing
the value of the FOR variable within the loop).

Also, since the TO expression is evaluated only once, at the time FOR
is performed, a statement such as FOR I=1 TO I+100 is valid.  The
terminating value is not checked until NEXT is executed, so the loop
statements always execute at least once.  The variable used by FOR
must be a nonarray floating point variable.  Reusing the same FOR

Autostart ROM Cartridge

An 8K or 16K autostart ROM cartridge designed to use this as a
starting memory address may be plugged into the Expansion Port on the
back.  If the cartridge ROM at locations 32772-32776 ($8004-$8008)
contains the numbers 195, 194, 205, 56, 48 ($C3, $C2, $CD, $38, $30)
when the computer powers up, it will start the program pointed to by
the vector at locations 32768-32769 ($8000-$8001), and will use
32770-32771 ($8002-$8003) for a warm start vector when the RESTORE key
is pressed.  These characters are PETASCII for the inverse letters
CBM, followed by the digits 80.  An autostart cartridge may also be
addressed at 40960 ($A000), where it would replace BASIC, or at 61440

It is possible to have a 16K cartridge sitting at 32768 ($8000), such
as Simon's BASIC, which can be turned on and off so that the BASIC ROM
underneath can also be used.  Finally, it is even possible to have
bank-selected cartridges, which turn banks of memory in the cartidge
on and off alternately, so that a 32K program could fit into only 16K

RS-232: Mock 6551 Status Register

The contents of this register indicate the error status of RS-232 data
transmission.  That status can be determined by PEEKing this location
directly, by referencing the BASIC reserved variable ST, or by using
the Kernal READST (65031, $FE07) routine.

Note that if you use ST or Kernal, this location will be set to 0
after it is read.  Therefore, if you need to test more than one bit,
make sure that each test preserves the original value, because you
won't be able to read it again.  The meaning of each bit value is
specified below:

Bit 7: 1 (bit value of 128) = Break Detected
Bit 6: 1 (bit value of 64)  = DTR (Data Set Ready) Signal Missing
Bit 5: Unused
Bit 4: 1 (bit value of 16)  = CTS (Clear to Send) Signal Missing
Bit 3: 1 (bit value of 8)   = Receiver Buffer Empty
Bit 2: 1 (bit value of 4)   = Receiver Buffer Overrun
Bit 1: 1 (bit value of 2)   = Framing Error
Bit 0: 1 (bit value of 1)   = Parity Error

The user is responsible for checking these errors and taking
appropriate action.  If, for example, you find that Bit 0 or 1 is set
when you are sending, indicating a framing or parity error, you should
resend the last byte.  If Bit 2 is set, the GET#2 command is not being
executed quickly enough to empty the buffer (BASIC should be able to
keep up at 300 baud, but not higher).  If Bit 7 is set, you will want
to stop sending, and execute a GET#2 to see what is being sent."

Voice 1 Control Register

Bit 0:  Gate Bit:  1=Start attack/decay/sustain, 0=Start release
Bit 1:  Sync Bit:  1=Synchronize Oscillator with Oscillator 3 frequency
Bit 2:  Ring Modulation:  1=Ring modulate Oscillators 1 and 3
Bit 3:  Test Bit:  1=Disable Oscillator 1
Bit 4:  Select triangle waveform
Bit 5:  Select sawtooth waveform
Bit 6:  Select pulse waveform
Bit 7:  Select random noise waveform


Bit 0.  Bit 0 is used to gate the sound.  Setting this bit to a 1
while selecting one of the four waveforms will start the
attack/decay/sustain part of the cycle.  Setting this bit back to 0
(while keeping the same waveform setting) anytime after a note has
started playing will begin the release cycle of the note.  Of course,
in order for the gate bit to have an effect, the frequency and
attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) registers must be set, as well as
the pulse width, if necessary, and the volume control set to a nonzero
value.

Bit 1.  This bit is used to synchronize the fundamental frequency of
Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 3, allowing
you to create a wide range of complex harmonic structures from voice
1.  Synchronization occurs when this bit is set to 1.  Oscillator 3
must be set to some frequency other than zero, but no other voice 3
parameters will affect the output from voice 1.

Bit 2.  When Bit 2 is set to 1, the triangle waveform output of voice
1 is replaced with a ring modulated combination of Oscillators 1 and
3.  This ring modulation produces nonharmonic overtone structures that
are useful for creating bell or gong effects.

Bit 3.  Bit 3 is the test bit.  When set to 1, it disables the output
of the oscillator.  This can be useful in generating very complex
waveforms (even speech synthesis) under software control.

Bit 4.  When set to 1, Bit 4 selects the triangle waveform output of
Oscillator 1.  Bit 0 must also be set for the note to be sounded.

Bit 5.  This bit selects the sawtooth waveform when set to 1.  Bit 0
must also be set for the sound to begin.

Bit 6.  Bit 6 chooses the pulse waveform when set to 1.  The harmonic
content of sound produced using this waveform may be varied using the
Pulse Width Registers.  Bit 0 must be set to begin the sound.

Bit 7.  When Bit 7 is set to 1, the noise output waveform for
Oscillator 1 is set.  This creates a random sound output whose
waveform varies with a frequency proportionate to that of Oscillator
1.  It can be used to imitate the sound of explosions, drums, and
other unpitched noises.

One of the four waveforms must be chosed in order to create a sound.
Setting more than one of these bits will result in a logical ANDing of
the waveforms.  Particularly, the combination of the noise waveform
and another is not recommended.

Location Range: 54277-54278 ($D405-$D406)
Voice 1 Envelop (ADSR) Control

When a note is played on a musical instrument, the volume does not
suddenly rise to a peak and then cut off to zero.  Rather, the volume
builds to a peak, levels off to an intermediate value, and then fades
away.  This creates what is known as a volume envelope.

The first phase of the envelope, in which the volume builds to a peak,
is known as the attack phase.  The second, in which it declines to an
intermediate level, is called the decay phase.  The third, in which
the intermediate leve of volume is held, is known as the sustain
period.  The final interval, in which the sound fades away, is called
the release part of the cycle.

The SID chip allows the volume envelope of each voice to be
controlled, so that specific instruments may be imitated, or new
sounds created.  This is done via the attack/decay and sustain/release
registers.  Each register devotes four bits (which can store a number
from 0 to 15) to each phase of the cycle.  When a note is gated by
writing a 1 to a waveform bit and to Bit 0 of the Control Register,
the attack cycle begins.

The volume of the sound builds to a peak over the period of time
specified by the high nybble of the attack/decay register.  Once it
has reached the peak volume, it falls to the intermediate level during
the period indicated by the low nybble of the attack/decay register
(this is the decay phase).  The volume of this intermediate or sustain
level is selected by placing a value in the high nybble of the
sustain/release register.  This volume level is held until a 0 is
written to the gate bit of the control register (while leaving the
waveform bit set).  When that happens, the release phase begins, and
the volume of the sound begins to taper off during the period
indicated by the low nybble of the sustain/release register.

You may notice the volume of the sound does not quite get to 0 at the
end of the release cycle, and you may need to turn off the sound to
get rid of the residual noise.  You can do this either by setting the
waveform bit back to 0, changing the frequency to 0, or setting the
volume to 0."

Vector: Routine to Convert a Number from Floating Point to Signed
Integer

This vector points to the address of the BASIC routine which converts
a floating point number to an integer.  In the current Kernal version,
the address that it points to is 45482 ($B1AA).  Disassembly of the
ROMs indicates that BASIC does not use this vector.  However, it may
be of real assistance to the programmer who wishes to use data that is
stored in floating point format.  The parameter that is passed by the
USR command is available only in that format, for example.

Since it is extremely difficult to decipher and use a floating point
number, the simplest way to deal with such data is to use the
conversion routines that are built into BASIC to change it into a
two-byte signed integer.  This could be accomplished by jumping
directly into the BASIC ROM, if you know the location of the routine.
Therefore, if the address changes in future versions of the 64 or
future Commodore computers, you won't have to modify your program to
make it work with them.

See the entry for the USR vector at 785 ($311) for an explanation of
how to use this routine in connection with the USR command."

watch out for the Interrupt disable flag.

A 1 in this flag bit is equal to an SEI instruction, which turns off

Current Secondary Address

This location holds the secondary address of the device currently
being used.  The range of valid secondary address numbers is 0 through
31 for serial devices, and 0 through 127 for other devices.

Secondary device numbers mean something different to each device that
they are used with.  The keyboard and screen devices ignore the
secondary address completely.  But any device which can have more than
one file open at the same time, such as the disk drive, distinguishes
between these files by using the secondary address when opening a disk
file.  Secondary address numbers 0, 1, and 15-31 have a special
significance to the disk drive, and therefore device numbers 2-14 only
should be used as secondary addresses when opening a disk file.

OPENing a disk file with a secondary address of 15 enables the user to
communicate with the Disk Operating System through that channel.  A
LOAD command which specifies a secondary address of 0 (for example,
LOAD 'AT BASIC',8,0) results in the program being loaded not to the
address specified on the file as the starting address, but rather to
the address pointed to by the start of BASIC pointer (43, $2B).

A LOAD with a secondary address of 1 (for example, LOAD 'HERE',8,1)
results in the contents of the file being loaded to the address
specified in the file.  A disk file that has been LOADed using a
secondary address of 1 can be successfully SAVEd in the same manner
(SAVE 'DOS 5.1',8,1).

LOADs and SAVEs that do not specify a secondary address will default
to a secondary address of 0.

When OPENing a Datasette recorder file, a secondary address of 0
signifies that the file will be read, while a secondary address of 1
signifies that the file will be written to.  A value of 2 can be added
to indicate that an End of Tape marker should be written as well.
This marker tells the Datasette not to search past it for any more
files on the tape, though more files can be written to the tape if
desired.

As with the disk drive, the LOAD and SAVE commands use secondary
addresses of 0 and 1 respectively to indicate whether the operation
should be relocating or nonrelocating.

When the 1515 or 1525 Printer is opened with a secondary address of 7,
the uppercase/lowercase character set is used.  If it is openend with
a secondary address of 0, or without a secondary address, the
uppercase/graphics character set will be used."

Load RAM from a Device

This is a documented Kernal routine, whose entry in the jump table

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 816 ($330).  LOAD is used to
transfer data froma device directly to RAM.  It can also be used to
verify RAM, comparing its contents to those of a disk or tape file.
To choose between these operations you must set the Accumulator with a
0 for LOAD, or a 1 for VERIFY.

Since the LOAD routine performs an OPEN, it must be preceded by a call
to the SETLFS routine to specify the logical file number, device
number, and secondary address, and a call to the SETNAM routine to
specify the filename (a LOAD from tape can be performed without a
filename being specified).  Then the .X and .Y registers should be set
with the starting address for the load, and the LOAD routine called.
If the secondary address specified was a 1, this starting address will
be ignored, and the header information will be used to supply the load
address.  If the secondary address was a 0, the address supplied by
the call will be used.  In either case, upon return from the
subroutine, the .X and .Y registers will contain the address of the

1K boundary (location evenly divisible by 1024).  This is done by
manipulating the VIC-II chip memory bank select at location 56576
($DD00).

It is important to note, however, that while any area may be
displayed, the Operating System will look here to find out where it
should PRINT characters.  Therefore, if you change the screen location
by altering the contents of one of the two addresses listed above, the
Operating System will still not know where to PRINT characters unless
you also change this address as well.  The result will be that
characters entered from the keyboard or PRINTed will not appear on the
screen.

Examples of how to properly relocate the screen can be found at the
entries for location 53272 ($D018) and 43 ($2B).

Since the PRINT command in essence just POKEs a lot of values to
screen and color memory, by changing this pointer you can print a
string of characters to memory locations other than screen RAM.  For
example, you could PRINT a sprite shape to memory without having to
READ a lot of DATA statements.  The program below PRINTs different
sprite shapes into the sprite data area:

10 SP=53248:POKESP,170:POKESP+1,125:POKESP+21,1:POKE 2040,13:PRINT CHR$(147)
20 A$='THIS TEXT WILL BE PRINTED TO THE SPRITE SHAPE DATA AREA AND DISPLAYED'
30 GOSUB 100
40 A$='THIS IS SOME DIFFERENT TEXT TO BE PRINTED TO THE SPRITE SHAPE AREA'
50 GOSUB 100
60 COUNT=COUNT+1:IF COUNT<15 THEN 20
70 END
100 POKE 648,3:PRINT CHR$(19);CHR$(17);SPC$(24);A$;:POKE 648,4:RETURN

Since PRINTing also changes color memory, you can change the pointer
to print the characters harmlessly to ROM, while changing a lot of
screen RAM at one time, as the following program demonstrates:

10 D$=CHR(94):FOR I=1 TO 4:D$=D$+D$:NEXT
20 PRINT CHR$(147);:FOR I=1 TO 7:PRINT TAB(10) D$:NEXT:PRINT:PRINT:PRINT:PRINT

Input a Character from the Current Device

This is a documented Kernal routine whose jump table entry point is at
65487 ($FFCF).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 804 ($324).  Its function is
to get a character from the current input device (whose device number
is stored at 153 ($99)).  This device must first have been OPENed and
then designated as the input channel by the CHKIN routine.

When this routine is called, the next byte of data available from this
device is returned in the Accumulator.  The only exception is the
routine for the keyboard device (which is the default input device).
It the keyboard is the current input device, this routine blinks the
cursor, fetches characters from the keyboard buffer, and echoes them
to the screen until a carriage return is encountered.  When a carriage
return is round, the routine sets a flag to indicate the length of the
last logical line before the return character, and reads the first
character of this logical line from the screen.

Subsequent calls to this routine will cause the next character in the
line to be read from the screen and returned in the Accumulator, until
the carriage return character is returned to indicate the end of the
line.  Any call after this character is received will start the whole
process over again.

Note that only the last logical line before the carriage return is
used.  Any time you type in more than 80 characters, a new logical
line is started.  This routine will ignore any characters on the old
logical line, and process only the most recent 80-character group."

RS-232: Mock 6551 Control Register

This location is used to control the RS-232 serial I/O baud rate
(speed at which data is transmitted and received), the word length
(number of bits per data character), and the number of stop bits used
to mark the end of a transmitted character.  It uses the same format
as that of the 6551 UART control register to set these parameters,
although, as you will see, some of the 6551 configurations are not
implemented by the software that emulates the UART device.  For
example, the standard baud rates which are higher than 2400 baud are
not implemented, presumably because the software cannot keep up at
higher rates.  The meanings of the various bit patterns are as
follows:

Bit 7: STOP Bits
0    (bit value of 0)   = 1 STOP Bit
1    (bit value of 128) = 0 STOP Bits

Bits 6-5: WORD LENGTH
00   (bit value of 0)   = 8 DATA Bits
01   (bit value of 32)  = 7 DATA Bits
10   (bit value of 64)  = 6 DATA Bits
11   (bit value of 96)  = 5 DATA Bits

Bit 4: Unused

Bits 3-0: BAUD RATE

0011 (bit value of 3)   = 110 Baud
0100 (bit value of 4)   = 134.5 Baud
0101 (bit value of 5)   = 150 Baud
0110 (bit value of 6)   = 300 Baud
0111 (bit value of 7)   = 600 Baud
1000 (bit value of 8)   = 1200 Baud
1001 (bit value of 9)   = 1800 Baud
1010 (bit value of 10)  = 2400 Baud
1011 (bit value of 11)  = 3600 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)
1100 (bit value of 12)  = 4800 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)
1101 (bit value of 13)  = 7200 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)

This register is the only one which must be set when opening RS-232
device (number 2).  The first character of the filename will be stored
here.  For example, the statement OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(6+32) will set the
value of this location to 38.  As you can see from the above chart,
this sets up the RS-232 device for a data transfer rate of 300 baud,
using seven data bits per character and one stop bit."

Memory locations 0-255 ($0-$FF) have a special significance in 6502
machine language programming (the 6510 microprocessor in the Commodore
64 shares the same instruction set as the 6502).  Since these
addresses cn be expressed using just one byte, instructions which
access data stored in these locations are shorter and execute more
quickly than do instructions which operate on addresses in higher
memory, which requires two bytes.

Because of this relatively fast execution time, most 6502 software
makes heavy use of zero-page locations.  The 64 is no exception, and
uses this area for many important system variables and pointers.

In addition, locations 0 and 1 have special Input/Output functions on
the 6510.  In the case of the 64, this on-chip I/O port is used to

Vector to IRQ Interrupt Routine

This vector points to the address of the routine that is executed when
an IRQ interrupt occurs (normally 59953 ($FA31)).

At power on, the CIA #1 Timer B is set to cause an IRQ interrupt to
occur every 1/60 second.  This vector is set to point to the routine
which updates the software clock and STOP key check, blinks the
cursor, maintains the tape interlock, and reads the keyboard.  By
changing this vector, the user can add or substitute a machine
language routine that will likewise execute every 1/60 second.  The
user who is writing IRQ interrupt routines should consider the
following:

1.  It is possible for an IRQ interrupt to occur while you are
changing this vector, which would cause an error from which no
recovery could be made.  Therefore, you must disable all IRQ
interrupts before changing the contents of this location, and reenable
them afterwards, by using the 6510 SEI and CLI instructions, or by
using the Kernal VECTOR routine (64794, $FD1A) to set this vector.

2.  There is some code in ROM that is executed before the interrupt
routine is directed through this vector.  This code checks whether the
source of the interrupt was an IRQ or BRK instruction.  If first
preserves the contents of all the registers by pushing them onto the
stack in the following sequence:  PHA, TXA, PHA, TYA, PHA.  It is up
to the user to restore the stack at the end of his routine, either by
exiting through the normal IRQ, or with the sequence:  PLA, TAY, PLA,
TAX, PLA, RTI.

3.  There is only one IRQ vector, but there are many sources for IRQ
interrupts (two CIA chips, and several VIC chip IRQs).  If you plan to
enable IRQs from more than one source, the IRQ routine here must
determine the source, and continue the routine in the appropriate
place for an IRQ from that source.

In the same vein, if you replace the normal IRQ routine with your own,
you should be aware that the keyboard's scanning and clock update will
not occur unless you call the old interrupt routine once every 1/60
second.  It is suggested that if you plan to use that routine, you
save the old vector address in some other location.  In that way, you
can JuMP to the keyboard interrupt routine through this alternate
vector, rather than assuming that the ROM address will never change
and that it is safe to jump into the ROM directly."

Sound Interface Device (SID) Registers

Mmeory locations 54272-54300 ($D400-$D41C) are used to address the
6581 Sound Interface Device (SID).

SID is a custom music synthesizer and sound effects generator chip
that gives the 64 its impressive musical capabilities.  It provides
three separate music channels, or voices, as they are called.  Each
voice has 16-bit frequency resolution, waveform control, envelope
shaping, oscillator synchronization, and ring modulation.  In
addition, programmable high-pass, low-pass, and band-pass filters can
be set and enabled or disabled for each sound channel.

Since quite a few of these locations must be used in concert to
produce sound, a brief summary of the interplay between some of these
registers may be helpful.

Often the first step is to select an overall volume level using the
Volume Register.  Then, the desired frequency or pitch of the note is
chosen by writing to each of the two bytes which make up the 16-bit
Frequency Register.

An ADSR envelope setting must be chosen by writing values to the
Attack/ Decay and Sustain/Release Register.  These determine the rate
of the rise and fall of the volume of the note from zero volume to
peak volume and back again.  These rates have a great influence on the
character of the sound.

Finally, the waveform must be selected, and the note started (or the
oscillator gated, as we say).  This is done by writing certain bits to
the Control Register.  The waveform control lets you select one of
four different waveforms, each of which has varying harmonic content
that affects the tone quality of the sound.  By writing a 1 to the
gate bit, you start the Attack/ Delay/Sustain cycle.  Afer rising to a
peak and declining to the Sustain volume, the volume will continue at
the same level until you write a 0 to the gate bit.  Then, the Release
cycle will start.  Make sure that you keep the same waveform bit set
to 1 while you write the 0 to the gate bit, so that the Release cycle
starts.  Otherwise, the sound will stop entirely, as it also will if
the Volume Register or the Frequency Register is set to 0.

It should be noted that except for the last four SID chip registers,
these addresses are write-only.  That means that their values cannot
be determined by PEEKing these locations.

Location Range: 54272-54273 ($D400-$D401)
Voice 1 Frequency Control

Together, these two locations control the frequency or pitch of the
musical output of voice 1.  Some frequency must be selected in order
for voice 1 to be heard.  This frequency may be changed in the middle
of a note to achieve special effects.  The 16-bit range of the
Frequency Control Register covers over eight full octaves, and allows
you to vary the pitch from 0 (very low) to about 4000 Hz (very high),
in 65536 steps.  The exact frequency of the output can be determined
by the equation

FREQUENCY=(REGISTER VALUE*CLOCK/16777216)Hz

where CLOCK equals the system clock frequency, 1022730 for American
(NTSC) systems, 985250 for European (PAL), and REGISTER VALUE is the
combined value of these frequency registers.  That combined value
equals the value of the low byte plus 256 times the value of the high
byte.  Using the American (NTSC) clock value, the equation works out
to

FREQUENCY=REGISTER VALUE*.060959458 Hz"

Sprite Horizontal and Vertical Position Registers

These locations determine the horizontal and vertical position at
which each sprite will be displayed on the screen.  Each sprite has
its own horizontal and vertical position register.  In addition, all
of the sprites share a common register which is used to extend the
range of horizontal positions.

Vertical positions for each sprite range from 0 to 255, and these
indicate the vertical position of the top line of the sprite's 21-line
length.  Since there are only 200 visible scan lines in the screen
display, some of these vertical positions will result in the sprite
being partially or wholly offscreen.

The visible viewing area starts at line 50 and extends to line 249.
Therefore, any sprite whose vertical psition is 29 ($1D) or less will
be completely above the visible picture.  At vertical position 30
($1E), the bottom line of the sprite display becomes visible at the
top of the screen.  At position 230 ($E6), the bottom line of the
sprite is lost from view off the bottom of the screen, and at vertical
position 250 ($FA), the entire sprite disappears from view off the
bottom edge of the screen.

Horizontal positioning is somewhat trickier, because the visible
display area is 320 dots wide, and one eight-bit register can hold
only 256 position values.  Therefore, an additional register is needed
to hold the ninth bit of each sprite's horizontal position.

Each sprite is assigned a single bit in the Most Significant Bit of
Horizontal Position register (MSB register) at 53264 ($D010).  If that
bit is set to 1, the value 256 is added to the horizontal position.
This extends the range of possible horizontal positions to 511.

In order to set a sprite's horizontal position, you must make sure
that both the values in the horizontal position register and the MSB
Register are correct.  For example, if you wish to set the horizontal
position of Sprite 5 to a value of 30, you must place a value of 30 in
the Sprite 5 Horizontal Position Register (POKE 53258,30 will do it
from BASIC), and you must also clear Bit 5 of the MSB Register (POKE
53264,PEEK(53264)AND(255-16)).  If you forget the MSB register, and
Bit 5 is set to 1, you will end up with position 286 instead of 30.

The horizontal position value indicates the position of the leftmost
dot of the sprite's 24-dot width.  The visible display is restricted
to the 320 dot positions between positions 24 and 344.  At position 0
the whole sprite is past the left edge of the visible screen.  At
position 1 the righmost dot enters the display area, and at position
24 ($18) the entire sprite is displayed on screen.  At position 321
($141) the rightmost dot goes past the right edge of the visible
display area, and a position 355 ($158) the whole sprite has moved out
of sight, off the right edge of the screen.

These registers are all intialized to 0 at power-up."

This location is the first of a number of hardware registers that we
will discuss.  Although they can be written to and/or read like RAM,
they are connected to hardware devices, and their contents affect the
operation of the devices.

Each bit of this Data Direction Register determines whether the
contents of the corresponding bit on the Internal I/O Port (see
location 1) can be written to by peripheral devices.  If the bit is
set to 0, it indicates the direction of data flow as Input, which
means that the corresponding bit of the I/O port will be affected by
peripheral defices.  If the bit is set to 1, it indicates Output.  On
the 64, only Bits 0-5 are significant.  On power-up, this register is
set to 239 ($EF), which indicates that all bits, except for Bit 4
(which senses the cassette switch), are set up for Output."

Floating Point Accumulator #1

The Floating Point Accumulator is central to the execution of any
BASIC mathematical operation.  It is used in the conversion of
integers to floating point numbers, strings to floating point numbers,
and vice versa.  The results of most evaluations are stored in this
location.

The internal format of floating point numbers is not particularly easy
to understand (or explain).  Generally speaking, the number is broken
into the normalized mantissa, which represents a number between 1 and
1.99999..., and an exponent value, which represents a power of 2.
Multiplying the mantissa by 2 raised to the value of the exponent
gives you the value of the floating point number.

Fortunately, the BASIC interpreter contains many routines for the
manipulation and conversion of floating point number, and these
routines can be called by the user.  See the entries for locations 3
and 5

Floating Point Accumulator #1 can be further divided into the
following locations:"

RS-232 Pseudo 6551 Registers

For serial Input/Output via the RS-232 port, the internal software of
the Commodore 64 emulates the operation of a 6551 UART chip (that's
Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, for you acronym buffs),
also known as an ACIA (Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter).

These RAM locations are used to mimic the functions of that chip's
hardware command, control, and status registers.  Although RAM
locations are allocated for mimicking the 6551's ability to use either
an on-board baud rate generator or an external clock crystal, this
function is not implemented by the internal software.

Provisions have been made for the user to communicate with these
registers through the RS-232 OPEN command.  When device 2 is opened, a
filename of up to four characters may be appended.  These four
characters are copied to locations 659-662 ($293-$296), although the
last two, which specify a nonstandard baud rate, are not used because
that feature is not implemented."

Since the message printing routine is entered after the test for

The value here starts at 6.  If location 652 ($28C) contains a 0, the

repeat flag at 650 ($28A) allows that key to repeat, its ASCII
equivalent will once again be placed in the keyboard buffer.  A value
of 4 is then placed in location 651, allowing subsequent repeats to

Vector: Non-Maskable Interrupt

This vector points to the address of the routine that will be executed
when a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) occurs (currently at 65095
($FE47)).

There are two possible sources for an NMI interrupt.  The first is the
RESTORE key, which is connected directly to the 6510 NMI line.  The
second is CIA #2, the interrupt line of which is connected to the 6510
NMI line.

When an NMI interrupt occurs, a ROM routine sets the Interrupt disable
flag, and then jumps through this RAM vector.  The default vector
points to an interrupt routine which checks to see what the cause of
the NMI was.

If the cause was CIA #2, the routine checks to see if one of the
RS-232 routines should be called.  If the source was the RESTORE key,
it checks for a cartridge, and if present, the cartridge is entered at
the warm start entry point.  If there is no cartridge, the STOP key is
tested.  If the STOP key was pressed at the same time as the RESTORE
key, several of the Kernal initialization routines such as RESTOR,
IOINIT and part of CINT are executed, and BASIC is entered through its
warm start vector at 40962.  If the STOP key was not pressed
simultaneously with the RESTORE, the interrupt will end without
letting the user know that anything happened at all when the RESTORE
key was pressed.

Since this vector controls the outcome of pressing the RESTORE key, it
can be used to disable the STOP/RESTORE sequence.  A simple way to do
this is to change this vector to point to the RTI instruction.  A
simple POKE 792,193 will accomplish this.  To set the vector back,
POKE 792,71.  Note that this will cut out all NMIs, including those
required for RS-232 I/O."

Software Jiffy Clock

These three locations are updated 60 times a second, and serve as a
software clock which counts the number of jiffies (sixtieths of a
second) that have elapsed since the computer was turned on.

The value of location 162 ($A2) is increased every jiffy (0.1667
second), 161 ($A1) is updated every 256 jiffies (4.2267 seconds), and
160 ($A0) changes every 65536 jiffies (or every 18.2044 minutes).
After 24 hours, these locations are set back to 0.

The jiffy clock is used by the BASIC reserved variables TI and TI$.
These are not ordinary variables that are stored in the RAM variable
area, but are functions that call the Kernal routines RDTIM (63197,
$F6DD), and SETTIM (63204, $F6E4).  Assigning the value of TI or TI$
to another variable reads these locations, while assigning a given
value to TI$ alters these locations.

To illustrate the relationship between these locations and TI$, try
the following program.  The program sets the jiffy clock to 23 hours,
50 minutes.  After the program has been running for one minute, all
these locations will be reset to 0.

100 TI$='235900'
110 PRINT TI$,PEEK(160),PEEK(161),PEEK(162)
120 GOTO 110

Since updating is done by the IRQ interrupt that reads the keyboard,
anything which affects the operation of that interrupt routine will
also interfere with this clock.  A typical example is tape I/O
operations, which steal the IRQ vector for their own use, and restore
it afterwards.  Obviously, user routines which redirect the IRQ and do
not send it back to the normal routine will upset software clock
operation as well."

The chief function of this register is to determine which blocks of
RAM and ROM the 6510 microprocessor will address.  The Commodore 64
comes with 64K RAM, even though it normally does not use all of that
RAM at once.  In addition, it has an 8K BASIC Interpreter ROM, an 8K
Operating System Kernal ROM, a 4K Character Generator ROM, a Sound
Interface Device (SID), a 6566 Video Interface Controller (VIC-II),
and two 6526 Complex Interface adapter chips.

To address all of these at once would require 88K, 24K past the
addressing limit of the 6510 microprocessor.  In order to allocate
address space, the I/O Port is used to affect the addressing lines,
and thus determine which segments of RAM and ROM will be addressed at
any one time.

Bit 0.  This bit controls the LORAM signal.  A 0 in this bit position
switches the BASIC ROM out, and replaces it with RAM at addresses
40960-49151 ($A000-$BFFF).  The default value of this bit is 1.

Bit 1.  Bit 1 controls the HIRAM signal.  A 0 in this bit position
switches the Kernal ROM out, and replaces it with RAM at 57344-65535
($E000-$FFFF).  As the BASIC interpreter uses the Kernal, it is also
switched out and replaced by RAM.  The default value of this bit is 1.

The system allows a wide range of combinations of RAM and ROM to be
utilized.  Of course, the BASIC programmer will have little need, in
the ordinary course of events, to switch out the BASIC ROM and the
Kernal.  To do so would just hang the system up.  But one way to make
use of this feature is to move the contents of ROM to the
corresponding RAM addresses.  That way, you can easily modify and
customize the BASIC interpreter and OS Kernal routines, which are
ordinarily fixed in ROM.  For examples, to move BASIC into RAM, just
type:

FOR I=40960 TO 49151:POKE I,PEEK(I):NEXT

Though it appears that such a program would not do anything, it in
fact copies bytes from ROM to RAM.  This is because any data which is
written to a ROM location is stored in the RAM which resides at the
same address.  So while you are PEEKing ROM, you are POKEing RAM.  To
switch to your RAM copy of BASIC, type in:

POKE 1,PEEK(1) AND 254.

Now you are ready to make modifications.  Examples of simple
modifications include changing the text which the interpreter prints,
such as the READY prompt, the power-up message, or the keyword table.

An example of the latter would be POKE 41122,69.  This changes the FOR
keyword to FER, so that BASIC would respond normally to a FER-NEXT
loop, but fail to recognize FOR as syntactically correct.

On the more practical side, you could change the prompt that INPUT
issues to a colon, rather than a question mark:

POKE 43846,58

You are not limited to just cosmetic changes of text.  Jim Butterfield
has given an example in COMPUTE! magazine of changing the interpreter
so that it assigns a null string the ASCII value 0.  In the ROM
version, the command PRINT ASC('') will return ?ILLEGAL QUANTITY
ERROR.  This is inconvenient when INPUTting a string, because if the
user presses RETURN and you try to check the ASCII value of the string
that has been entered, you will get this error.  By entering POKE
46991,5, this is changed so that PRINT ASC('') now responds with a
zero.

For the more serious machine language programmer, it is quite feasible
to add new commands or modify existing ones by diverting the vectors
which are discussed in the section covering the BASIC interpreter ROM.
For a good example of this technique, see the article 'Hi-Res Graphics
Made Simple' by Paul Schatz in COMPUTE!'s First Book of Commodore 64
Sound and Graphics.  The program example there inserts new graphics
commands into a RAM version of BASIC.  When you want to switch back to
the ROM BASIC, enter POKE 1,PEEK(1) OR 1.

For machine language applications, it would be possible to replace the
ROM programs with an entirely different operating system, or an
application that has its own screen editing and I/O functions
included.  Such an application would first have to be loaded from disk
into RAM.  A language other than BASIC could be loaded, and could then
just switch out the BASIC ROM, while still using the OS Kernal.

Or a spreadsheet application that contained its own I/O routines could
switch out all ROMs and have the use of all of RAM that is not
actually needed for the program itself, for data.  It should be
remembered, however, that before switching the Kernal out, it is
necessary to disable interrupts, as the vectors for these interrupts
are contained in the Kernal.

Bit 2.  This bit controls the CHAREN signal.  A 0 in this position
switches the character generator ROM in, so that it can be read by the
6510 at addresses 53248-57343 ($D000-$DFFF).  Normally, this bit is
set to 1, so that while the VIC-II chip has access to the character
generator ROM for purposes of creating the screen display, the user
cannot PEEK into it.  Since this ROM is switched into the system in
the same location as the I/O devices (SID chip, VIC-II chip, and 6526
CIA's), o I/O can occur when this ROM is switched in.

The ability to switch in the character generator ROM is very useful to
the programmer who wishes to expirement with user-defined characters.
Modified character graphics is one of the  more powerful graphics
tools available, but often the user will not want to redefine a whole
character set at one time.  By reading the character ROM and
duplicating its contents in RAM, the user can replace only a few
characters in the set.  The method for reading this ROM into RAM from
BASIC is as follows:

10 POKE 56333,127:POKE1,PEEK(1) AND 251:FOR I=0 TO 2048
20 POKE BASE+I,PEEK(53248+I):NEXT:POKE 1,PEEK(1) OR 4:POKE 56333,129

The first POKE is necessary to turn off the system timer interrupt.
Since the I/O devices are addressed in the same space as the character
ROM, switching that ROM in switches all I/O out, making it necessary
to turn off any interrupts which use these devices.

The second POKE is the one which switches in the character ROM.  The
program loop then reads this ROM memory into RAM, starting with the
address BASE.  Note that this address should start on an even 2K
boundary (an address evenly divisible by 2048) within the block of
memory presently being addresses by the VIC-II chip (for more
information on where to put user-defined character sets, and how to
use them, see the section on the VIC-II chip, under location 53272
($D018), the section on the character ROM at 49152 ($C000), and the
section on banking VIC-II memory at 56576 ($DD00)).  After reading the
contents of ROM into RAM, the next POKEs switch out the character ROM
and restore the interrupt.

It should be noted that while Bits 0-2 of this register allow software
control of some signals that determine the memory configuration that
is used by the Commodore 64 at any given time, they are not the only
determining factor.  Signals can also be generated by means of plug-in
expansion cartridges which are connected to the expansion port, and
these can change the memory map.

Two lines located on the exapansion port are called GAME and EXROM.
When used in conjunction with the software-controlled lines noted
above, these two hardware lines can enable cartridge ROM to replace
various segments of ROM and/or RAM.

Possible configurations include 8K of cartridge ROM to be switched in
at $8000-$9FFF, for a BASIC enhancement program; an 8K cartridge ROM
at $A000-$BFFF, replacing BASIC, or at $E000-$FFFF, replacing the
Kernal, or a 16k cartridge at $8000-$C000.

When cartridge ROM is selected to replace the Kernal, a Max emulator
mode is entered, which mimics the specification of the ill-fated Max
Machine, a game machine which Commodore never produced for sale int he
U.S.  In this mode, only the first 6K of RAM are used, there is no
access to the character ROM, and graphics data such as charactger
dot-data is mapped down from 57344 ($E000) to 8192 ($2000).  Further
hardware information may be obtained from the Commodore 64
Programmer's Reference Guide.

Bits 3-5 of this register have functions connected with the Datasette
recorder.  These are as follows:

Bit 3.  This is the Cassette Data Output line.  This line is connected
to the Cassette Data Write line on the cassette port, and is used to
send the data which is written to tape.

Bit 4.  This bit is the Cassette Switch Sense line.  This bit enables
a program to tell whether or not one of the buttons that moves the
recorder is pressed down.  If the switch on the recorder is down, this
bit will have a value of 1.  Remember that Bit 4 of the data direction
register at location 0 must contain a 0 for this bit to properly
reflect the status of the switch.

Bit 5.  Bit 5 is the Cassette Motor Control.  Setting this bit to zero
allows the motor to turn when you press one of the buttons on the
recorder, while setting it to one disables it from turning.

Most of the time, the setting of this bit will be controlled by the
interrupt routine that is used to read the keyboard every sixtieth of
a second.  If none of the buttons on the recorder is pressed, that
interrupt routine shuts the motor off and sets the interlock at
location 192 ($C0) to zero.  When a button is pressed, if the
interlock location is zero, Bit 5 of this register is set to zero to
turn the motor on.

When the interlock location contains a zero, the keyscan routine will
not let you control the setting of this bit of the register (and the
interlock is always set to zero when no buttons are pressed).  In
order for you to gain control of the motor, you must POKE a nonzero
value into 192 after a button on the recorder has been pressed.  You
can then shut off the motor and turn it back on as you please, by
manipulating this bit, so long as a button stays pressed."

Store Base Address of Memory-Mapped I/O Devices in .X and .Y Registers

This is one of the documented Kernal routines for which there is a
vector in the jump table at 65523 ($FFF3).

When called, this routine sets the .X register to the low byte of the
base address of the memory-mapped I/O devices, and puts the high byte
in the .Y register.  This allows a user to set up a zero-page pointer
to the device, and to load and store indirectly through that pointer.
A program which uses this method, rather than directly accessing such
devices could be made to function without change on future Commodore
models, even though the I/O chips may be addressed at different
locations.  This of course assumes that the CIA or a similar chip will
be used.  This routine is of limited value for creating software that
is compatible with both the VIC-20 and the 64 because of the
differences in the VIA I/O chip that the VIC uses.

frequencies nearest the cutoff.  This creates an even sharper
filtering effect.  A setting of 0 causes no resonance, while a setting

Location Range: 54297-54298 ($D419-$D41A)
Game Paddle Inputs

These registers allow you to read the game paddles that plug into
joystick Controller Ports 1 and 2.  Each paddle uses a variable
resistor (also known as a potentiometer or pot), whose resistance is
controlled by turning a knob.  The varying resistance is used to vary
the voltage to two pins of the SID chip between 0 and +5 volts.
Analog-to-digital (A/D) converters in the chip interpret these voltage
levels as binary values and store the values in these registers.
These registers return a number from 0 (minumum resistance) to 255
(maximum resistance) for each paddle in either of the ports, depending
on the position of the paddle knob.

Since these registers will read the paddle values for only one
controller port, there is a switching mechanism which allows you to
select which of the two ports to read.  By writing a bit-pair of 01
(bit value of 64) to the last two bits of CIA #1 Data Port A (56320,
$DC00), you select the paddles on joystick Controller Port 1.  By
writing a bit-pair of 10 (bit value of 128), you select the paddles on
Controller Port 2.

If you look at the description of Data Port A (56320, $DC00), however,
you will notice that it is also used in the keyboard scanning process.
By writing to this port, you determine which keyboard column will be
read.

Since the IRQ interrupt keyboard scan routine and the routine that
checks for the STOP key are putting values into this location 60 times
per second, you cannot reliable select the pair of paddles you wish to
read from BASIC without first turning off the keyboard IRQ.  This can
be done with a POKE 56333,127.  You can then read the paddles with the
statements A=PEEK(54297) and B=PEEK(54298).  The IRQ can be restored
after a paddle read with a POKE 56333,129.  It may, however, be easier
and more accurate in the long run to use a machine language paddle
read subroutine such as that presented on page 347 of the Commodore 64
Programmer's Reference Guide.

The paddle fire buttons are read as Bits 2 and 3 of the Data Ports A
(56320, $DC00) and B (56321, $DC01).  On Port A, if Bit 2 is set to 0,
button 1 is pushed, and if Bit 3 is set to 0, button 2 is pushed.  On
Port B, if Bit 2 is set to 0, button 3 is pushed, and if Bit 3 is set
to 0, button 4 is pushed.

The BASIC statements to test these buttons, thereore, are:

PB(1)=(PEEK(56321)AND4)/4
PB(2)=(PEEK(56321)AND8)/8
PB(3)=(PEEK(56320)AND4)/4
PB(4)=(PEEK(56320)AND8)/8

If a 0 is returned by the PEEK statement, the button is pushed, and if
a 1 is returned, it is not."

Color RAM

The normal Commodore 64 text graphics system uses a screen RAM area to
keep track of the character shapes that are to be displayed.  But
since each character can be displayed in any of 16 foreground colors,
there must also be a parallel area which keeps track of the foreground
color.  This 1024-byte area is used for that purpose (actually, since
there are only 1000 screen positions, only 1000 byte actually affect
screen color).

These 1000 bytes each control the foreground color of one character,
with the first byte controlling the foreground color of the character
in the upper- left corner, and subsequent bytes controlling the
characters to the right and below that character.

Because only four bits are needed to represent the 16 colors
available, only the low four bits of each Color RAM location are
connected (this is why they are sometimes referred to as Color RAM
Nybbles).  Writing to the high bits will not affect them, and these
four bits will usually return a random value when read (a small number
of 64s return a constant value).

Therefore, in order to read Color RAM correctly, you must mask out the
top bits by using the logical AND function.  In BASIC, you can read
the first byte of Color RAM with the statement CR=PEEK(55296)AND15.
This will always return a color value between 0 and 15.  These color
values correspond to the following colors:

 0 = BLACK
 1 = WHITE
 2 = RED
 3 = CYAN (LIGHT BLUE-GREEN)
 4 = PURPLE
 5 = GREEN
 6 = BLUE
 7 = YELLOW
 8 = ORANGE
 9 = BROWN
10 = LIGHT RED
11 = DARK GRAY
12 = MEDIUM GRAY
13 = LIGHT GREEN
14 = LIGHT BLUE
15 = LIGHT GRAY

Color mapping affords a convenient method of changing the color of the
text display without changing the letters.  By POKEing the appropriate
section of Color RAM, you can change the color of a whole section of
text on the screen without affecting the content of the text.  You can
even use this method to make letters disappear by changing their
foreground colors to match the background (or by changing the
background to match the foreground), and later make them reappear by
changing them back, or by changing the background to a contrasting
color.  An interesting example program which changes Color RAM quickly
in BASIC can be found under the entry for 648 ($288).

A change in the Operating System causes newer 64s to set all of the
Color RAM locations to the same value as the current background color
whenever the screen is cleared.  Therefore, POKEing character codes to
the Screen RAM area will not appear to have any effect, because the
letters will be the same color as the background.  This can easily be
turned to your advantage, however, because it means that all you have
to do to set all of Color RAM to a particular value is to set the
background color to that value (using the register at 53281 ($D021)),
clear the screen, and return the background color in the desired
value.

The various garphics modes use this area differently than does the
regular text mode.  In high-resolution bitmap mode, this area is not
used at all, but in multicolor bitmap mode it is used to determine the
color of the 11 bit-pair for a given 8 by 8 dot area.

In multicolor text mode, only the lowest three bits are used, so only
colors 0-7 may be selected.  The fourth bit is used to determine
whether a character will be displayed in regular text or multicolor
text.  Characters with a color value over 7 are displayed as
multicolor characters, with the color of the 11 bit-pair determined by
the color value minus 8.  Characters with a color value under 8 are
displayed normally.

It should be noted that unlike the Screen RAM area, which can be moved
to any RAM location, the Color RAM area is fixed, and will function
normally regardless of where screen memory is located."

Kernal Jump Table

The following jump table is provided by Commodore in an effort to
maintain stable entry points for key I/O routines.  Each three-byte
table entry consists of a 6510 JMP instruction and the actual address
of the routine in the ROM.  Although the actual address of the routine
may vary from machine to machine, or in later versions of the Kernal,
these addresses will stay where they are.  By jumping to the entry
point provided by this table, rather than directly into the ROM, you
insure your programs against changes in the Operating System.  In
addition, this jump table may help you write programs that will
function on more than one Commodore machine.  The 15 table entries
from 65472-65514 ($FFC0-$FFEA) are the same for all Commodore
machines, from the earliest PET on.

As an additional aid, some of these routines are also vectored through
the table which starts at 788 ($314).  Since this table is in RAM, you
can change those vectors to point to your own routines which support
additional I/O devices.  Programs that use the jump table entry points
to the I/O routines will be able to use these I/O devices without a
problem.

The following table will give the entry point, routine name, RAM

Vector: Keyboard Decode Table

KEYTAB points to the address of the keyboard matrix lookup table
currently being used.  Although there are only 64 keys on the keyboard
matrix, each key can be used to print up to four different characters,
depending on whether it is struck by itself or in combination with the
SHIFT, CTRL, or Commodore logo keys.

The tables pointed to y this address hold the ASCII value of each of
the 64 keys for one of these possible combinations of keypresses.
When it comes time to print the character, the table that is used
determines which character is printed.

The addresses of the four tables are:

60289 ($EB81) = default uppercase/graphics characters (unshifted)
60354 ($EBC2) = shifted characters
60419 ($EC03) = Commodore logo key characters
60536 ($EC78) = CTRL characters

The concept of the keyboard matrix tables should not be confused with
changing the character sets from uppercase/graphics to
upper/lowercase.  The former involves determining what character is to
be placed into screen memory, while the latter involves determining
which character data table is to be used to decode the screen memory
into individual dots for the display of characters on the screen.
That character base is determined by location 53272 ($D018) of the
VIC-II chip."

Keyboard Buffer (Queue)

This buffer, sometimes also referred to as the keyboard queue, holds
the ASCII values of the characters entered from the keyboard.  The
interrupt routine which scans the keyboard deposits a character here
each time a key is pressed.  When BASIC sees that there are characters
waiting, it removes and prints them, one by one, in the order in which
they were entered.

This kind of a buffer is known as FIFO, for First In, First Out.  The
buffer will hold up to ten characters, allowing you to type faster
than the computer prints characters, without losing characters.  The
maximum number of characters this buffer can hold at one time is ten
(as determined by the value at 649 ($289)).  Characters entered after
the buffer is full will be ignored.

The commands GET and INPUT retrieve characters from this buffer.  If
one of these is executed while there are already characters waiting in
the buffer, those characters will be fetched as if they were part of
the data being input.  To prevent this from happening, you can clear
the buffer by POKEing a 0 into location 198 ($C6), which holds the
number of characters that are waiting in the buffer.

One of the most interesting and useful techniques for programming
Commodore computers is to have a program simulate direct entry of
commands from the keyboard.  This dynamic keyboard trick is achieved
by first POKEing PETASCII characters, usually cursor movement
characters and carriage returns, into the buffer, and setting location
198 ($C6) to show how many characters are waiting in the buffer.

Next, you clear the screen, and PRINT the statements that you wish to
have executed on the screen, carefully positioning them so that the
first statement to be entered is on the fourth line of the screen.

You then home the cursor and execute an END statement.  This causes
the keyboard buffer to be read, and the carriage returns to be
executed, thus entering the printed lines as if they had been typed in
immediate or direct mode.  The program can be continued by including a
GOTO statement in the last line entered.

Many interesting effects can be achieved using this method.  Examples
of a few of these are included below.  For example, program lines can
be added, modified, or deleted, while the program is running.  The
following example shows how this is done:

10 REM THIS LINE WILL BE DELETED
20 REM A NEW LINE 30 WILL BE CREATED
40 PRINT CHR$(147):PRINT:PRINT
50 PRINT '80 LIST':PRINT'30 REM THIS LINE WASN'T HERE BEFORE'
60 PRINT '10':PRINT 'GOTO 80'CHR$(19)
70 FOR I=631 TO 634:POKE I,13:NEXT:POKE 198,4:END
80 REM THIS LINE WILL BE REPLACED

You can use this technique to enter numbered DATA statements
automatically, using values in memory.  These statements become a
permanent part of the program.

Another interesting application is taking ASCII program lines from a
tape data file, or sequential disk file, and having them entered
automatically.  This can be used for merging programs, or for
transferring programs between computers with a modem and a terminal
program.  To create the ASCII program file, you use CMD to direct a
LISTing to the desired device as follows:

For tape: OPEN 1,1,1,'ASCII':CMD 1:LIST
After the listing has ended: PRINT #1:CLOSE 1

For disk: OPEN 8,8,8,'ASCII,S,W':CMD 8:LIST
After the listing has ended: PRINT #8:CLOSE 8

This file can then be uploaded using a modem and appropriate terminal
software, entered by itself or merged with another program by using
the following program.  Be sure to save this program before you run
it, because it will erase itself when it is done.

60000 OPEN 1,8,8,'ASCII'

Screen Line Link Table/Editor Temporary Storage

This table contains 25 entries, one for each row of the screen
display.  Each entry has two functions.  Bits 0-3 indicate on which of
the four pages of screen memory  the first byte of memory for that row
is located.  This is used in calculating the pointer to the starting
address of a screen line at 209 ($D1).

While earlier PETs used one table for the low bytes of screen rows and
another for the high bytes, this is not possible on the 64, where
screen memory is not fixed in any one spot.  Therefore, the Operating
System uses a table of low bytes at 60656 ($ECF0), but calculates the
high byte by adding the value of the starting page of screen memory
held in 648 ($288) to the displacement page held here.

The other function of this table is to establish the makeup of logical
lines on the screen.  While each screen line is only 40 characters
long, BASIC allows the entry of program lines that contain up to 80
characters.  Therefore, some method must be used to determine which
pairs of physical lines are linked into a longer logical line, so that
this longer logical line may be edited as a unit.

The high bit of each byte here is used as a flag by the screen editor.
That bit is set (leaving the value of the byte over 128 ($80)) when a
line is the first or only physical line in a logical line.  The high
bit is reset to 0 only when a line is the second half of a logical
line."

Read Oscillator 3/Random Number Generator

This register lets you read the upper eight bits of the waveform
output of Oscillator 3.  The kinds of numbers generated by this output
depend on the type of waveform selected.

If the sawtooth waveform is chosen, the output read by this register
will be a series of numbers which start at 0 and increase by 1 to a
maximum of 255, at which time they start over at 0.

When the triangle waveform is chosen, they increase from 0 to 255, at
which time they decrease to 0 again.  The rate at which these numbers
change is determined by the frequency of Oscillator 3.

If the pulse waveform is selected, the output here will be either 255
or 0.

Finally, selecting the noise waveform will produce a random series of
numbers between 0 and 255.  This allows you to use the register as a
random number generator for games.

There are many other uses for reading Oscillator 3, however,
particularly for modulation of the other voices through machine
language software.  For example, the output of this register could be
added to the frequency of another voice.  If the triangle waveform
were selected for this purpose, it would cause the frequency of the
other voice to rise and fall, at the frequency of Oscillator 3
(perhaps for vibrato effects).  This output can also be combined with
the Filter Frequency or Pulse Width Registers to vary the values in
these registers quickly over a short period of time.

Normally, when using Oscillator 3 for modulation, the audio output of
voice 3 should be turned off by setting Bit 7 of the Volume and Filter
Select Register at 54296 ($d418) to 1.  It is not necessary to gate
Bit 0 of Control Register 3 to use the oscillator, however, as its
output is not affected by the ADSR envelope cycle."

Pointer to the Start of the BASIC Variable Storage Area

This location points to the address which marks the end of the BASIC
program text area, and the beginning of the variable storage area.
All nonarray variables are stored here, as are string descriptors (for
the address of the area where the actual text of strings is stored,
see location 51 ($33)).

Seven bytes of memory are allocated for each variable.  The first two
bytes are used for the variable name, which consists of the ASCII
value of the first two letters of the variable name.  If the variable
name is a single letter, the second byte will contain a zero.

The seventh bit of one or both of these bytes can be set (which would
add 128 to the ASCII value of the letter).  This indicates the
variable type.  If neither byte has the seventh bit set, the variable
is the regular floating point type.  If only the first byte has its
seventh bit set, the variable is a string.  If only the second byte
has its seventh bit set, the variable is a defined function (FN).  If
both bytes have the seventh bit set, the variable is an integer.

The use of the other five bytes depends on the type of variable.  A
floating point variable will use the five bytes to store the value of
the variable in floating point format.  An integer will have its value
stored in the third and fourth bytes, high byte first, and the other
three will be unused.

A string variable will use the third byte for its length, and the
fourth and fifth bytes for a pointer to the address of the string
text, leaving the last two bytes unused.  Note that the acrual string
text that is pointed to is located either in the part of the BASIC
program where the string is first assigned a value, or in the string
text storage area pointed to by location 51 ($33).

A function definition will use the third and fourth bytes for a
pointer to the address in the BASIC program text where the function
definition starts.  It uses the fifth and sixth bytes for a pointer to
the dependent variable (the X of FN A(X)).  The final byte is not
used.

Knowing something about how variables are created can help your BASIC
programming.  For example, you can see that nonarray integer variables
take up no less space than floating point variables, and since most
BASIC commands convert the integers to floating point, they do not
offer a speed advantage either, and in many cases will actually slow
the program down.  As will be seen below, however, integer arrays can
save a considerable amount of space.

Variables are stored in the order in which they are created.
Likewise, when BASIC goes looking for a variable, it starts its search
at the beginning of this area.  If commonly used variables are defined
at the end of the program, and are thus at the back of this area, it
will take longer to find them.  It may help program execution speed to
define the variables that will be used most frequently right at the
beginning of the program.

Also, remember that once created, variables do not go away during
program execution.  Even if they are never used again, they still take
up space in the variable storage area, and they slow down the routine
that is used to search for variables that are referenced.

Another point to consider about the order in which to define variables
is that arrays are created in a separate area of memory which starts
at the end of the nonarray variable area.  Therefore, every time a
nonarray variable is created, all of the arrays must be moved seven
bytes higher in memory in order to make room for the new variable.
Therefore, it may help performance to avoid defining nonarray
variables after defining arrays.

This pointer will be reset to one byte past the end of the BASIC
program text whenever you execute the statements CLR, NEW, RUN, or
LOAD.  Adding or modifying a BASIC statement will have the same
effect, because the higher numbered BASIC statements have to be moved
up into memory to make room for the new statements, and can therefore
overwrite the variable storage area.  This means that if you wish to
check the value of a variable after stopping a program, you can only
do so before modifying the program.

The exception to the above is when the LOAD command is issued from a
program.  The purpose of not resetting this pointer in such a case is
to allow the chaining of programs by having one program load and then
run the next (that is also why a LOAD issued from a program causes a
RUN from the beginning of the program).  This allows the second
program to share variables with the first.  There are problems with
this, however.  Some string variable descriptors and function
definitions have their pointers set to areas within the program text.
When this text is replaced by a load, these pointers are no longer
valid, which will lead to errors if the FN or string value is
referenced.  And if the second program text area is larger than that
of the first, the second program will overwrite some of the first
program's variables, and their values will be lost.

The ability to chain short programs is a holdover from the days of the
8K PET, for which this BASIC was written, but with the vastly
increased memory of the 64, program chaining should not be necessary.

You should also note that SAVE uses this pointer as the address of the
byte after the last byte to SAVE."

Current BASIC Line Number

This location contains the line number of the BASIC statement which is
currently being executed, in LSB/MSB format.  A value of 255 ($FF) in
location 58 ($3A), which translates to a line number of 65280 or above
(well over the 63999 limit for a program line), means that BASIC is
currently in immediate mode, rather than RUN mode.

BASIC keywords that are illegal in direct mode check 58 ($3A) to
determine whether or not this is the current mode.

When in RUN mode, this location is updated as each new BASIC line is
fetched for execution.  Therefore, a TRACE function could be added by
diverting the vector at 776 ($308), which points to the routine that
executes the next token, to a user-written routine which prints the
line number indicated by this location before jumping to the token
execution routine.  (LISTing the line itself would be somewhat harder,
because LIST uses many Page 0 locations that would have to be
preserved and restored afterwards.)

program execution stopped.  The value here is copied to 59 ($3B) by
STOP, END, and the stop-key BREAK, and copied back by CONT."

LIST saves the highest line number to list (or 65535 ($FFFF) if
program is to be listed to the end) at this location.

GOTO tests the target line number to see if it is greater than the
line number currently being executed.  If it is greater, GOTO starts
its search for the target line at the current line number.  If it is
not greater, GOTO must search for the target line from the first line
of the program.  It is interesting to note that the test is of the
most significant byte only.  Therefore, INT(TARGETLINE/256) must be
greater than INT(CURRENTLINE/256) in order for the search to start
with the current line, instead of at the beginning of the program.

PEEK, POKE, WAIT, and SYS use this location as a pointer to the

Serial Data Port

The CIA chip has an on-chip serial port, which allows you to send or
receive a byte of data one bit at a time, with the most significant
bit (Bit 7) being transferred first.  Control Register A at 56334
($DC0E) allows you to choose input or output modes.  In input mode, a
bit of data is read from the SP line (pin 5 of the User Port) whenever
a signal on the CNT line (pin 4) appears to let you know that it is
time for a read.  After eight bits are received this way, the data is
placed in the Serial Port Register, and an interrupt is generated to
let you know that the register should be read.

In output mode, you write data to the Serial Port Register, and it is
sent out over the SP line (pin 5 of the User Port), using Timer A for
the baud rate generator.  Whenever a byte of data is written to this
register, transmission will start as long as Timer A is running and in
continuous mode.  Data is sent at half the Timer A rage, and an output
will appear on the CNT line (pin 4 of the User Port) whenever a bit is
sent.  After all eight bits have been sent, an interrupt is generated
to indicate that it is time to load the next byte to send into the
Serial Register.

The Serial Data Register is not used by the 64, which does all of its
serial I/O through the regular data ports."

to the earlier VIA and PIA devices used on the VIC-20 and PET.  This

In addition to its two data ports, CIA #1 has two timers, each of
which can count an interval from a millionth of a second to a
fifteenth of a second.  Or the timers can be hooked together to count
much longer intervals.  CIA #1 has an interrupt line which is
connected to the 6510 IRQ line.  These two timers can be used to
generate interrupts at specified intervals (such as the 1/60 second
interrupt used for keyboard scanning, or the more complexly timed
interrupts that drive the tape read and write routines).  As you will

These registers are where the actual communication with outside

can be read here.

The keyboard is so necessary to the computer's operation that you may
have a hard time thinking of it as a peripheral device.  Nonetheless,
it cannot be directly read by the 6510 microprocessor.  Instead, the
keys are connected in a matrix of eight rows by eight columns to CIA

As you can see, there are two keys which do not appear in the matrix.
The SHIFT LOCK key is not read as a separate key, but rather is a
mechanical device which holds the left SHIFT key switch in a closed
position.  The RESTORE key is not read like the other keys either.  It
is directly connected to the NMI interrupt line of the 6510
microprocessor, and causes an NMI interrupt to occur whenever it is
pressed (not just when it is pressed with the STOP key).

In order to read the individual keys in the matrix, you must first set
Port A for all outputs (255, $FF), and Port B for all inputs (0),
using the Data Direction Registers.  Note that this is the default
condition.  Next, you must write a 0 in the bit of Data Port A that
corresponds to the column that you wish to read, and a 1 to the bits
that correspond to columns you wish to ignore.  You will then be able
to read Data Port B to see which keys in that column are being pushed.

A 0 in any bit position signifies that the key in the corresponding
row of the selected column is being pressed, while a 1 indicates that
the key is not being pressed.  A value of 255 ($FF) means that no keys
in that column are being pressed.

Fortunately for us all, an interrupt routine causes the keyboard to be
read, and the results are made available to the Operating System
automatically every 1/60 second.  And even when the normal interrupt
routine cannot be used, you can use the Kernal SCNKEY routine at 65439
($FF9F) to read the keyboard.

These same data ports are also used to read the joystick controllers.
Although common sense might lead you to believe that you could read
the joystick that is plugged into the port marked Controller Port 1
from Data Port A, and the second joystick from Data Port B, there is
nothing common about the Commodore 64.  Controller Port 1 is read from
Data Port B, and Controller Port 2 is read from CIA #1 Data Port A.

Joysticks consist of five switches, one each for up, down, right, and
left directions, and another for the fire button.  The switches are
read like the key switches--if the switch is pressed, the
corresponding bit will read 0, and if it is not pressed, the bit will
be set to 1.  From BASIC, you can PEEK the ports and use the AND and
NOT operators to mask the unused bits and inverse the logic for easier
comprehension.  For example, to read the joystick in Controller Port
1, you could use the statement:

S1=NOT PEEK(56321)AND15

The meaning of the possible numbers returned are:

 0 = none pressed
 1 = up
 2 = down
 4 = left
 5 = up left
 6 = down left
 8 = right
 9 = up right
10 = down right

The same technique can be used for joystick 2, by substituting 56320
as the number to PEEK.  By the way, the 3 and 7 aren't listed because
they represent impossible combinations like up-down.

To read the fire buttons, you can PEEK the appropriate port and use
the AND operator to mask all but bit 4:

T1=(PEEK(56321)AND16)/16

The above will return a 0 if the button is pressed, and a 1 if it is
not.  Substitute location 56320 as the location to PEEK for Trigger
Button 2.

Since CIA #1 Data Port B is used for reading the keyboard as well as
joystick 1, some confusion can result.  The routine that checks the
keyboard has no way of telling whether a particular bit was set to 0
by a keypress or one of the joystick switches.  For example, if you
plug the joystick into Controller Port 1 and push the stick to the
right, the routine will interpret this as the 2 key being pressed,
because both set the same bit to 0.  Likewise, when you read the
joystick, it will register as being pushed to the right if the 2 key
is being pressed.

The problem of mistaking the keyboard for the joystick can be solved
by turning off the keyscan momentarily when reading the stick with a
POKE 56333, 127:POKE 56320,255, and restoring it after the read with a
POKE 56333,129.  Sometimes you can use the simpler solution of
clearing the keyboard buffer after reading the joystick, with a POKE
198,0.

The problem of mistaking the joystick for a keypress is much more
difficult--there is no real way to turn off the joystick.  Many
commercially available games just use Controller Port 2 to avoid the
conflict.  So, if you can't beat them, sit back and press your
joystick to the left in order to slow down a program listing (the
keyscan routine thinks that it is the CTRL key).

As if all of the above were not enough, Port A is also used to control
which set of paddles is read by the SID chip, and to read the paddle
fire buttons.  Since there are two paddles per joystick Controller
Port, and only two SID registers for reading paddle positions, there
has to be a method for switching the paddle read from joystick Port 1
to joystick Port 2.

When Bit 7 of Port A is set to 1 and Bit 6 is cleared to 0, the SID
registers will read the paddles on Port 1.  When Bit 7 is set to 0 and
Bit 6 is set to 1, the paddles on Port 2 are read by the SID chip
registers.  Note that this also conflicts with the keyscan routine,
which is constantly writing different values to CIA #1 Data Port A in
order to select the keyboard column to read (most of the time, the
value for the last column is written to this port, which coincides
with the selection of paddles on joystick Port 1).  Therefore, in
order to get an accurate reading, you must turn off the keyscan IRQ
and select which joystick port you want to read.  See POTX at 54297
($D419), which is the SID register where the paddles are read, for the
exact technique.

Although the SID chip is used to read the paddle settings, the fire
buttons are read at CIA #1 Data Ports A and B.  The fire buttons for
the paddles plugged into Controller Port 1 are read at Data Port B
(56321, $DC01), while those for the paddles plugged into Controller
Port 2 are read from Data Port A (56320, $DC00).  The fire buttons are
read at Bit 2 and Bit 3 of each port (the same as the joystick left
and joystick right switches), and as usual, the bit will read 0 if the
corresponding button is pushed, and 1 if it is not.

Although only two of the rout paddle values can be read at any one
time, you can always read all four paddle buttons.  See the game
paddle input description at 54297 ($D419) for the BASIC statements
used to read these buttons.

Finally, Data Port B can also be used as an output by either Timer A
or B.  It is possible to set a mode in which the timers do not cause
an interrupt when they run down (see the descriptions of Control
Registers A and B at 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)).  Instead, they cause the
output on Bit 6 or 7 of Data Port B to change.  Timer A can be set
either to pulse the output of Bit 6 for one machine cycle, or to
toggle that bit from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1.  Timer B can use Bit 7 of this
register for the same purpose."

        Write/ set or clear bits of this register (1=bits written with 1 will
        be set, 0=bits written with 1 will be cleared)

This register is used to control the five interrupt sources on the
6526 CIA chip.  These sources are Timer A, Timer B, the Time of Day
Clock, the Serial Register, and the FLAG line.  Timers A and B cause
an interrupt when they count down to 0.  The Time of Day Clock
generates an interrupt when it reaches the ALARM time.  The Serial
Shift Register interrupts when it compiles eight bits of input or
output.  An external signal pulling the CIA hardware line called FLAG
low will also cause an interrupt (on CIA #1, this FLAG line is
connected to the Cassette Read line of the Cassette Port).

Even if the condition for a particular interrupt is satisfied, the
interrupt must still be enabled for an IRQ actually to occur.  This is
done by writing to the Interrupt Control Register.  What happens when
you write to this register depends on the way that you set Bit 7.  If
you set it to 0, any other bit that was written to with a 1 will be
cleared, and the corresponding interrupt will be disabled.  If you set
Bit 7 to 1, any bit written to with a 1 will be set, and the
corresponding interrupt will be enabled.  In either case, the
interrupt enable flags for those bits written to with a 0 will not be
affected.

For example, in order to disable all interrupts from BASIC, you could
POKE 56333, 127.  This sets Bit 7 to 0, which clears all of the other
bits, since they are all written with 1's.  Don't try this from BASIC
immediate mode, as it will turn off Timer A which causes the IRQ for
reading the keyboard, so that it will in effect turn off the keyboard.

To turn on the Timer A interrupt, a program could POKE 56333,129.  Bit
7 is set to 1 and so is Bit 0, so the interrupt which corresponds to
Bit 0 (Timer A) is enabled.

When you read this register, you can tell if any of the conditions for
a CIA Interrupt were satisfied because the corresponding bit will be
set to a 1.  For example, if Timer A counts down to 0, Bit 0 of this
register will be set to 1.  If, in addition, the mask bit that
corresponds to that interrupt source is set to 1, and an interrupt
occurs, Bit 7 will also be set.  This allows a multi-interrupt system
to read one bit and see if the source of a particular interrupt was
CIA #1.  You should note, however, that reading this register clears
it, so you should preserve its contents in RAM if you want to test
more than one bit."

Current I/O Channel (CMD Logical File) Number

Whenever BASIC inputs or outputs data, it looks here to determine
which I/O device is currently active for the purpose of prompting or
output control.  It uses location 184 ($B8) for purposes of deciding
what device actually to put input from or output to.

When the default input device (number 0, the keyboard) or output
device (number 3, the display screen) is used, the value here will be
a zero, and the format of prompting and output will be the standard
screen output format.

When another device is used, the logical file number (CMD channel
number) will be placed here.  This lets the system now that it may
have to make some subtle changes in the way it performs the I/O
operation.  For example, if TAB is used with the PRINT command, cursor
right characters are used if the device PRINTed to is the screen.
Otherwise, spaces are output when the number here is other than zero
(the assumption being that you can't tab a printer like you can the
screen).

Likewise, the ? prompt for INPUT is suppressed if the file number here
is nonzero, as is the EXTRA IGNORED message, and input of a carriage
return by itself is ignored, rather than being treated as a null
string ('').  Therefore, by OPENing the screen as a device, and
issuing the CMD statement, you can force the suppression of the ?
prompt, and the other effects above.

CMD places the new output file number here, and calls the Kernal to
open the device for output, leaving it LISTENing for output (such as
the READY prompt, which is diverted to the new device).

Many routines reset this location and UNLISTEN the device, defeating
the CMD and once again sending the output to the screen.  If an error
message has to be displayed, for example, this location will be reset
and the message will be displayed on the screen.  GET, GET#, INPUT,
INPUT#, and PRINT# all will reset this location after the I/O is
completed, effectively redirecting output back to the screen.  PRINT
and LIST are the only I/O operations that will not undo the CMD.

This location can also be used to fool BASIC into thinking that data
it is reading from the tape is actually being entered into the
keyboard in immediate mode.

For a look at a technique that uses a different approach to accomplish
the same thing for disk or tape users, see location 512 ($200), the
keyboard buffer."

Pointer to the Highest Address Used by BASIC

The power-on/reset routine tests each byte of RAM until it comes to
the BASIC ROM, and sets this pointer to the adress of the highest byte
of consecutive RAM found (40959, $9FFF).

There are two circumstances under which this pointer may be changed
after power-up to reflect an address lower than the actual top of
consecutive RAM:

1.  Users may wish to lower this pointer themselves, in order to set
aside an area of free RAM that will not be disturbed by BASIC.  For
example, to set aside a 1K area at the top of BASIC, start your
program with the line:

POKE 56,PEEK(56)-4:CLR

The CLR is necessary to insure that the string text will start below
your safe area.

You may wish to store machine language programs, sprites, or alternate
character sets in such an area.  For the latter two applications,
however, keep in mind the 16K addressing range limitation of the
VIC-II chip.  If you do not assign the VIC-II to a bank other than the
default memory bank of 0-16383 ($0-$3FFF), you must lower the top of
memory below 16383 ($3FFF) if you wish your sprite or character data
area to be within its addressing range.

2.  Then the RS-232 device (number 2) is opened, this pointer and the
pointer to the end of user RAM at 643 are lowered by 512 bytes in
order to create two 256-byte buffers, one for input and the other for
output.

Since the contents of these buffers will overwrite any variables at
the top of memory, a CLR command is issued at the time device 2 is
opened.  Therefore, the RS-232 device should be opened before defining
any variables, and before setting aside a safe area for machine
language programs or other uses, as described above.

Pointer to the Start of BASIC Program Text

This two-byte pointer lets BASIC know where program text is stored.
Ordinarily, such text is located beginning at 2049 ($801).  Using this
pointer, it is possible to change the program text area.  Typical
reasons for doing this include:

1.  Conforming the memory configuration to that of other Commodore
computers.  On 32K PET and CBM computers, for example, screen memory
starts at 32768 ($8000), and BASIC text begins at 1025 ($401).  You
can emulate this configuration with the 64 with the following short
program:

10 POKE 55,0:POKE 56,128: CLR: REM LOWER TOP OF MEMORY TO 32768
20 POKE 56576,PEEK(56576) AND 253: REM ENABLE BANK 2
30 POKE 53272,4: REM TEXT DISPLAY MEMORY NOW STARTS AT 32768
40 POKE 648,128:REM OPERATING SYSTEM PRINTS TO SCREEN AT 32768 (128*256)
50 POKE 44,4:POKE 1024,0: REM MOVE START OF BASIC TO 1025 (4*256+1)
60 POKE 792,193: REM DISABLE RESTORE KEY
70 PRINT CHR$(147);'NOW CONFIGURED LIKE PET':NEW
80 REM ALSO SEE ENTRIES FOR LOCATION 55, 56576, AND 648

Such reconfiguring can be helpful in transferring programs from the 64
to the PET, or vice versa.  Since the 64 automatically relocates BASIC
program text, it can load and list PET programs even though the
program file indicates a loading addresss that is different from the
64 start of BASIC.  The PET does not have this automatic relocation
feature, however, and it loads all BASIC programs at the two-byte
address indicated at the beginning of the disk or tape file.

So if the PET loads a 64 program at its normal starting address of
2049 ($801), it will not recognize its presence because it expects a
BASIC program to start at 1025 ($401).  Therefore, if you want to let
a PET and 64 share a program, you must either reconfigure the 64 to
start BASIC where the PET does, or reconfigure the PET to start BASIC
where the 64 does (with a POKE 41,8:POKE 2048,0).

2.  Raising the lowest location used for BASIC text in order to create
a safe area in low memory.  For example, if you wish to use the
high-resolution graphics mode, you may want to put the start of screen
memory at 8192 ($2000).  The high-resolution moe requires 8K of
memory, and you cannot use the lowest 8K for this purpose because it
is already being used for the zero-page assignments.

Since BASIC program text normally starts at 2048 ($801), this means
that you only have 6k for program text before your program runs over
into screen memory.  One way around this is by moving the start of
basic to 16385 ($4001) by typing in direct entry mode:

POKE 44,64: POKE 64*256,0:NEW

Other uses might include setting aside a storage area for sprite shape
data, or user-defined character sets.

3.  Keeping two or more programs in memory simultaneously.  By
changing this pointer, you can keep more than one BASIC program in
memory at one time, and switch back and forth betwenn them.  Examples
of this application can be found in COMPUTE!'s First Book of PET/CBM,
pages 66 and 163.

This technique has a number of offshoots that are perhaps of more
practical use.

a) You can store two programs in memory simultaneously for the purpose
of appending one to the other.  This technique requires that the line
numbers of the two programs do not overlap.  (See Programming the
PET/CBM by Raeto Collin West, pages 41-42, for a discussion of this
technique).

b) You can have two programs in memory at once and use the concept in
(2) above to allow an easier way to create a safe area in low memory.
The first program is just onw line that sets the start of BASIC
pointer to the address of the second program which is located higher
in memory, and then runs that second program.

4. Since this address is used as the address of the first byte to
SAVE, you can save any section of memory by changing this pointer to
indicate the starting address, and the pointer 45-46 ($2D-$2D) to
indicate the address of the byte after the last byte that you wish to
save."

This area is exclusively for the microprocessor stack.  Some BASIC
commands, such as FOR-NEXT loops require many stack entries at a time.
Therefore, BASIC frequently checks the stack before pushing entries
on, and returns an OUT OF MEMORY error if an operation would result in
less than 62 bytes of available stack memory.

Each FOR statement causes 18 bytes to be pushed onto the stack, which
come off in the following order:

First comes a one-byte constant of 129 ($81).  Next is a two-byte
pointer to the address of the subject variable (the X of FOR X=1 to
10).  This is followed by the five-byte floating point representation
of the TO value.  Finally comes the two-byte line number of the line
to which the program returns after a NEXT, and the two-byte address of
the next character to read in that line after the FOR statement.

Each GOSUB call places five bytes on the stack.  The first byte to
come off is a one-byte constant of 141 ($8D).  The next two bytes
contain the line number of the statement to which the program will
RETURN after the subroutine ends.  And the final two bytes are a
pointer to the address of the BASIC program text for that statement in
which the program RETURNs.

DEF also leaves a five-byte entry on the stack.  It is the same as
that described for GOSUB, except that instead of a constant byte of
141, the first number is a dummy byte, whose value has no
significance."

BASIC Line Editor Input Buffer

When you are in the BASIC immediate mode, and type in a line of
characters, those characters are stored here.  BASIC then scans the
string of characters, converts the text to tokenized BASIC program
format, and either stores it or executes the line, depending on
whether or not it started with a line number.

This same area is also used to store data which is received via the
INPUT and GET commands.  This explains why these commands are illegal
in immediate mode--they must use the same buffer space that is
required by the immediate mode statement itself.

It is interesting to note that this buffer is 89 bytes long.  The
screen editor will allow a maximum of only 80 characters in a program
line, with one extra byte required for a 0 character, marking the end
of the line.  This presumable is a carry over from the VIC, which
allows a line length of up to 88 characters.  The last eight bytes of
this buffer are therefore normally not used, and can be considered
free space for the programmer to use as he or she sees fit.

Location Range: 601-630 ($259-$276)
Tables for File Numbers, Device Numbers, and Secondary Addresses

All three of the tables here have room for ten one-byte entries, each
of which represents an active Input/Output file.  When an I/O file is
opened, its logical file number is put into the table at 601 ($259),
the device number of the I/O device is put into the table at 611
($263), and its secondary address is put into the table at 621 ($26D).

The entry for any particular I/O file will occupy the same position in
each of the three tables.  That is, if logical file number 2 is the
third entry in the file number table, its secondary address will be
the third entry in the secondary address table, and its corresponding
device number will occupy the third spot in the device number table.

Every time a device is OPENed, its information is added as the last
entry in each table, and the value at location 152 ($98) is increased
by one, indicating that there is one more active I/O file.  When a
device is CLOSEd, the value at location 152 is decreased by one, and
all entries that occupy a position in the tables that is higher than
that of the closed device are moved down one position, thus
eliminating the entry for that device.  The Kernal CLALL routine
(62255, $F32F) simply zeros location 152, which has the effect of
emptying these tables."

Pointer to the Start of the BASIC Array Storage Area

This location points to the address of the end of nonarray variable
storage, and the beginning of array variable storage.  The format for
array storage is as follows:

The first two bytes hold the array name.  The format and high-bit
patterns are the same as for nonarray variables (see 45 ($2D) above),
except that there is no equivalent to the function definition.

Next comes a two-byte offset to the start of the next array, low byte
first.  Then there is a one-byte value for the number of array
dimensions (e.g., 2 for a two-dimensional array like A(x,y)).  That
byte is followed by pairs of bytes which hold the value of each array
dimension+1 (DIMensioning an array always makes space for 0, so A(0)
can be used).

Finally come the values of the variables themselves.  The format for
these values is the same as with nonarray values, but each value only
takes up the space required; that is, floating point variables use
five bytes each, integers two bytes, and string descriptors three
bytes each.

Remember that as with nonarray string, the actual string text is
stored elsewhere, in the area which starts at the location pointed to
in 51-52 ($33- $34)."

CIA #1 Data Direction Registers A and B

These Data Direction Registers control the direction of data flow over
Data Ports A and B.  Each bit controls the direction of the data on
the corresponding bit of the port.  If teh bit of the Direction
Register is set to a 1, the corresponding Data Port bit will be used
for data output.  If the bit is set to a 0, the corresponding Data
Port bit will be used for data input.  For example, Bit 7 of Data
Direction Register A controls Bit 7 of Data Port A, and if that
direction bit is set to 0, Bit 7 of Data Port A will be used for data
input.  If the direction bit is set to 1, however, data Bit 7 on Port
A will be used for data output.

The default setting for Data Direction Register A is 255 (all
outputs), and for Data Direction Register B it is 0 (all inputs).
This corresponds to the setting used when reading the keyboard (the
keyboard column number is written to Data Port A, and the row number

Filter Controls

In addition to the controls detailed above for each voice, the SID
chip also provides a filtering capability which allows you to
attenuate (make quieter) certain ranges of frequencies.  Any one or
all three voices can be filtered, and there is even a provision for
filtering an external signal that is input through pin 5 of the
monitor jack.

A low-pass filter is available, which suppresses the volume of those
frequency components that are above a designated cutoff level.  The
high-pass filter reduces the volume of frequency components that are
below a certain level.  The band-pass filter reduces the volume of
frequency components on both sides of the chosen frequency, thereby
enhancing that frequency.  Finally, the high-pass and low-pass filters
can be combined to form a notch reject filter, which reduces the
folume of the frequency components nearest the selected frequency.
These various filters can dramatically change the quality of the sound
produced.

The first two registers are used to select the filter cutoff
frequency.  This is the frequency above or below which any sounds will
be made quieter.  The further away from this level any frequency
components are, the more their output volume will be suppresed (high-
and low-pass filters reduce the volume of those components by 12 dB
per octave away from the center frequency, while the band-pass filter
attenuates them by 6 dB per octave).

The cutoff frequency has an 11-bit range (which corresponds to the
numbers 0 to 2047).  This is made up of a high-byte and three low
bits.  Therefore, to compute the frequency represented by the value in
these registers, you must multiply the value in the high byte by 8,
and add the value of the low three bits.  The range of cutoff
freqnencies represented by these 2048 values stretches from 30 Hz to
about 12,000 Hz.  The exact frequency may be calculated with the
formula:

FREQUENCY=(REGISTER VALUE*5.8)+30Hz

An additional element in filtering is the resonance control.  This
allows you to peak the volume of the frequency elements nearest the
cutoff frequency."

Perform RND

This routine comes up with a random number in one of three ways,
depending on the argument X of RND(X).  If the argument is positive,
the next RND value is obtained by multiplying the seed value in
location 139 ($8B) by one of the constants above, adding the other
constant, and scrambling the resulting bytes.  This produces the next
number in a sequence.  So many numbers can be produced in this way
before the sequence begins to repear that it can be considered random.

If the argument is negative, the argument itself is scrambled, and
made the new seed.  This allows creation of a sequence that can be
duplicated.

If the argument is 0, four bytes of the Floating Point Accumulator are
loaded from the low and high byte of Timer A, and the tenths of second
and second Time of Day Clock registers, all on CIA #1.  This provides
a somewhat random value determined by the setting of those timers at
the moment that the command is executed, which becomes the new seed
value.  The RND(1) command should then be used to generate further
random numbers.

The RND(0) implementation on the 64 has serious problems which make it
unusable for generating a series of random numbers when used by
itself.  First of all, the Time of Day Clock on CIA #1 (see
56328-56331 ($DC08-$DC0B)) does not start running until you write to
the tenth of second register.  The Operating System never starts this
clock, and therefore the two registers used as part of the floating
point RND(0) value always have a value of 0.  Even if the clock was
started, however, these registers keep time in Binary Coded Decimal
(BCD) format, which means that they do not produce a full range of
numbers from 0 to 255.  In addition, the Timer A high register output
ranges only from 0 to 66, which also imits the range of the final
floating point value so that certain numbers are never chosen."

definitely not the case on the 64.  Because conversion is from a
signed integer, any memory value over 32767 will be regarded as
negative (the high bit is treated as a sign bit).  Therefore, for
these higher values you must add twice the bit value of the high bit

Flag: Is Data Input to GET, READ or INPUT?

Since the keywords GET, INPUT, and READ perform similar functions,
BASIC executes some of the same instructions for all three.  There are
also many areas of difference, however, and this flag indicates which
of the three keywords is currently being executed, so that BASIC will
know whether or not to execute the instructions which relate to the
areas in which the commands differ (152 ($98)=READ, 64 ($40)=GET,
0=INPUT).

As a result, INPUT will show the ? prompt, will echo characters back
to the screen, and will wait for a whole line of text ended by a
carriage return.  GET gives no prompt and accepts one character
without waiting.  The colon character and the comma are valid data for
GET, but are treated as delimiters between data by INPUT and READ.

As each command has its own error messages, this flag is used to
determine the appropriate message to issue in case of an error."

Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #2 Registers

Locations 56576-56591 ($DD00-$DD0F) are used to address the Complex
Interface Adapter chip #2 (CIA #2).  Since the chip itself is
identical to CIA #1, which is addressed at 56320 ($DC00), the
discussion here will be limited to the use which the 64 makes of this
particular chip.  For more general information on the chip registers,
please see the corresponding entries for CIA #1.

One of the significant differences between CIA chips #1 and #1 is the
use to which Data Ports A and B are put.  The peripheral input and
output devices that CIA #2 controls are those on the Serial Bus (such
as the 1541 Disk Drive and 1525 printer), the RS-232 device (which is
used for telecommunications), and the User Port, an eight-bit parallel
port that can be turned to whatever purpose the user desires.  In
addition, Data Port A has the important task of selecting the 16K bank
ofmemory that will be used by the VIC-II chip for graphics.

Another significant difference between CIA chips #1 and #2 is that the
interrupt line of CIA #1 is wired to the 6510 IRQ line, while that of
CIA #2 is wired to the NMI line.  This means that interrupts from this
chip cannot be masked by setting the Interrupt disable flag (SEI).
They can be disabled from CIA's Mask Register, though.  Be sure to use
the NMI vector when setting up routines to be driven by interrupts
generated by this chip.

Location Range: 56576-56577 ($DD00-$DD01)
CIA #2 Data Ports A and B

These registers are where the communication with the Serial Bus,
RS-232 device, and User Port take place.  The Serial Bus is like the
IEEE bus which is used by the PET, in that it allows more than one
device to be connected to the port at a time, in a daisychain
arrangement.  Since each byte of data is sent one bit at a time,
however, the Serial Bus is at least eight times slower than the IEEE.
It is presently used to control the 1541 Disk Drive and 1525 printer,
and other devices (such as printer interface for Centronics- type
parallel pritners and stringy floppy wafer tape storage units) can be
placed on this bus.

Data Port A is used for communication with the Serial Bus.  Bits 5 and
7 are used for Serial Bus Data Output and Input, respectively, and
Bits 4 and 6 are used for the Serial Bus Clock Pulse Output and Input.
Bit 3 of Data Port A is used to send the ATN signal on the Serial Bus.

The 64 has built-in software to handle RS-232 communications through a
modem or other device plugged in the RS-232/User Port.  The RS-232
device uses Bit 2 of Data Port A for data output (it is the only line
from Port A that is connected to the RS-232/User Port jack).  It also
makes heavy use of Port B, using Bit 7 for the Data Set Ready (DSR)
signal, Bit 6 for the Clear to Send (CTS), Bit 4 for the Carrier
Detect (DCD), Bit 3 for the Ring Indicator (RI), Bit 2 for Data
Terminal Ready (DTR), Bit 1 for Request to Send (RTS), and Bit 0 for
data input.  See locations 659-660 ($293-$294) for more details on the
RS-232 device.

All of the data lines which the RS-232 device uses are also available
to the user as part of the User Port.  All of the Port B data lines,
and Bit 2 of Port A, are brought out to the User Port connector on the
back of the 64.  These data bits are utilized in the normal way:  The
port connections are made to TTL-level input or output devices, and
the direction of data is determined by the Data Direction Registers.

In addition, the User Port has pins connected to the two CIA Serial
Ports (whose eight-bit shift registers are well-suited for
serial-to-parallel and parallel-to-serial conversion),and the two CNT
lines which aid in the operation of the Serial Ports.  The CNT lines
can also be used in conjunction with the CIA Timers, and allow them to
be used as frequency counters, event counters, interval timers, etc.
The advanced features of the CIA chip make almost any type of
interfacing application possible, and in the near future we will
probably see many interesting applications for the User Port on the
64.  A pin description of tthe User Port connector is provided below:

One of the handshaking lines on the above chart, PC2, was not covered
in the discussion of CIA #1, because that line of CIA #1 is not
connected to anything.  The CIA #2 PC line is accessible from the User
Port, however.  This line will go low for one cycle following a read
or write of Port B on CIA #2.  This signal lets external devices know
when data has been read or written.

Bits 0 and 1 of CIA #2 Port A have an extremely important function.
As mentioned in the section on the VIC-II chip (53248, $D000), the
video chip can address only 16K of memory at a time, and all graphics
data must be stored in that 16K block in order to be displayed.
Within this area, sprite graphics data may be placed in any of 256
groups of 64 bytes each.  Character data can be stored in any of eight
2K blocks.  Text screen memory may be in any of 16 1K areas, and
bitmap screen memory may be in either of two 8K sections.

When you turn the power on, the VIC-II uses the bottom 16K of memory
for graphics.  Unfortunately, this block of memory is also used
extensively for other important purposes.  Though some means of
eliminating these conflicts are discussed above, in many situations
you will want to change from the default 16K bank at the low end of
memory.

Bits 0 and 1 select the current 16K bank for video memory from the
four possible choices using the following bit patterns:

00 (bit value of 0) Bank 3 (49152-65535, $C000-$FFFF)
01 (bit value of 1) Bank 2 (32768-49151, $8000-$BFFF)
10 (bit value of 2) Bank 1 (16384-32767, $4000-$7FFF)
11 (bit value of 3) Bank 0 (0-16383, $0-$3FFF)

The technique for making this change from BASIC is discussed below.
But before we go ahead and start changing banks, let's briefly review
the contents of these areas, and the considerations for using them for
graphics.

Block 0.  This is normally used for system variables and BASIC program
text.  Locations 1024-2047 ($400-$7FF) are reserved for the default
position of screen memory.

There is an addition limitation on memory usage of this block, as the
VIC-II sees the character generator ROM at 4096-8191 ($1000-$1FFF),
making this portion of memory unavailable for other graphics data.
Generally, there is little free space here for graphics display data.
Locations 679-767 ($2A7- $2FF) are unused, and could hold one sprite
shape (number 11) or data for 11 characters.  The area from 820-1023
($334-$3FF), which includes the cassette I/O buffer, is available for
graphics memory, and is large enough to hold three sprite shapes
(numbers 13, 14, and 15), or data for 25 characters (numbers 103-127).
But getting enough memory for bitmap graphics requires that you either
reserve memory after the end of BASIC text by lowering the end of
BASIC pointer at 56 ($38), or raise the start of BASIC pointer at 44
($2C).  See the entries for these pointers for more details.

Block 1.  Block 1 is normally used for BASIC program storage.  When
using this bank, the VIC-II does not have access to the character
generator ROM.  Providing that you lower the top of memory so that
BASIC programs do not interfere, this area is wide open for sprite
shapes, character graphics, and bitmap graphics.

The drawbacks to useing this bank are the unavailability of the
character ROM and the limitation on BASIC program space (as little as
14K).  The absence of the character ROM is a relatively minor
nuisance, because you can always switch in the ROM and copy any or all
of the characters to RAM (see the entries for location 1 and the
alternate entry for 53248 ($D000), the Character ROM, for details).
This block may be a good alternate choice to avoid potential conflicts
with other applications that use higher memory.

Block 2.  The third block (Block 2) consists of 8K of RAM, half of
which is seen by the VIC-II chip as character ROM, and the 8K BASIC
interpreter ROM.  The BASIC ROM area is available for graphics.  This
is possible because of the 64's special addressing.  The VIC-II chip
reads only from RAM, and thus sees the RAM underneath the BASIC ROM,
even if the 6510 has ROM switched in.  The 6510, on the other hand,
always writes to RAM, even when dealing with memory it reads as ROM.
Whatever is written to the RAM underlying the BASIC ROM is displayed
normally by the VIC-II chip.  This opens up an extra 8K are for
sprites and character data under the BASIC ROM.

You should keep in mind that while you can write to this area, you
cannot read it from BASIC.  This may not be a serious problem when it
comes to character sets and sprite data, but it's more of a drawback
if you want to use this RAM for screen memory.

For example, the Operating System has to read the text screen to move
the cursor properly, and if it reads the ROM value instead of the RAM
screen data, it gets hopelessly confused, making it impossible to type
in any commands.

Likewise, you would not be able to read the high-resolution screen if
it were placed here, without some machine language trickery.  With
locations 36863-40959 ousted by the character ROM, only 4K of true RAM
remains for use as screen memory, not enough for a complete
high-resolution screen.  Therefore, this block is not recommended for
use in bitmap mode if your program needs to check the screen.
Otherwise, this is a good place for graphics memory, particularly if
you need to emulate the screen configuration of the PET.

Block 3.  Normally Block 3 contains 4K of RAM that is completely
unused by the system, 4K if I/O registers, and the 8K Operating System
Kernal ROM.  It is very convenient to use when you need a lot of
memory space for both graphics and a BASIC program.  Although the
character ROM is not available, it can be copied to RAM.  The area
under the Kernal ROM can be used as explained above.  One possible
conflict that you should be aware of is that the current version of
the DOS support program is written to reside at 52224 ($CC00).  It
would be safest to avoid using 52224-53247 for graphics if you plan to
use DOS support.

Changing banks.  Once you have selected a bank of 16K to use, the
procedure for making the change from BASIC is as follows:

1.  Set the Data Direction Register if necessary.  In order to use
Bits 0 and 1 of Port A to change banks, these bits must be set as
outputs in Data Direction Register A.  Since this is the default
condition on powering-up, this step normally will not be needed.

2.  Select a bank.  Banks 0-3 can be chosen by entering the following
lines:

POKE 56578,PEEK(56578) OR 3: REM SET FOR OUTPUT IF NOT ALREADY
POKE 56576,(PEEK(56576) AND 252) OR (3-BANK): REM BANK IS BANK #, MUST
  BE 0-3

3.  Set the VIC-II register for character memory.  As explained at the
entry for location 53272 ($D018), the formula for this is:

POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272) AND 240) OR TK: REM TK IS 2 KBYTE OFFSET FROM
  BEGINNING OF BLOCK

4.  Set the VIC-II register for display memory.  As explained at the
entry for location 53272 ($D018), the formula for this is:

POKE 53272,(PEEK(53272) AND 15) OR K*16: REM K IS KBYTE OFFSET FROM
  BEGINNING OF BLOCK

Since steps 3 and 4 operate on the same register, you could combine
these steps and just POKE 53272,(16*K+TK).

5.  Set the Operating System pointer for display memory at 648 ($288).
Even though you have just told the VIC-II chip where to display memory
for the screen, the Operating System does not yet know where to write
its text characters.  Let it know with this statement:

POKE 648,AD/256: REM AD IS THE ACTUAL ADDRESS OF SCREEN MEMORY

After you make this change, you must watch out for the STOP/RESTORE
key combination.  The BRK initialization changes the screen display
default to location 1024 in Bank 0, but not the Operating System
pointer at 648 ($288).  As a result, what you are typing will not be
displayed on the screen.  The computer will lock up until you turn the
power off and back on again.  The simplest way to avoid this problem
is to disable the RESTORE key entirely (see the entries for 792 ($318)
and 808 ($328) for more information).

Below is a sample program which switches to Bank 3.  It includes a
machine language transfer routine to move the ROM character set to
RAM, and a short interrupt routine to correct the RESTORE key problem.
After the switch is made, a loop isused to POKE characters into the
new screen memory area.  Next, the character data is slowly erased, to
show that the character set is now in RAM.  Then, a loop is used to
read the locations of the character set, and write to the same
locations.  This demonstrates that the 6510 reads the Kernal ROM when
you PEEK those locations, but POKEs to the RAM which is being
displayed.  Finally, the machine language move is used again to show
how quickly the set is restored.

It is used to read or change the values for the 16 RAM vectors to the
interrupt and important Kernal I/O routines in the table that starts

the current value of the 16 vectors will be stored at a table whose

this routine can change the vectors for the IRQ and NMI interrupts,
you might expect that the Interrupt disable flag would be set at its

wise to execute an SEI before calling it and a CLI afterwards (as the
power-on RESET routine does) just to be safe.

NMI Interrupt Entry Point

This routine is the NMI interrupt handler entry, which is pointed to
by the hardware NMI vector at 65530 ($FFFA).

Any time an NMI interrupt occurs, the Interrupt disable flag will be
set, and the routine will jump through the RAM vector at 792 ($318),
which ordinarily points to the continuation of this routine.  The
standard handler first checks to see if the NMI was caused by the
RS-232 device.  If not, the RESTORE key is assumed.  The routine
checks for a cartridge, and if one is found it exits through the
cartridge warm start vector at 32770 ($8002).  If not, the STOP key is
checked, and if it is being pressed, the BRK routine is executed.  If
the RS-232 device was the cause of the NMI, the cartridge and STOP key
checks are bypassed, and the routine skips to the end, where it checks
whether it is time to send or receive a data bit via the RS-232
device."

Flag: Editor in Quote Mode? 0=No

A nonzero value in this location indicates that the editor is in quote
mode.  Quote mode is toggled every time that you type in a quotation
mark on a given line--the first quote mark turns it on, the second
turns it off, the third turns it back on, etc.

If the editor is in this mode when a cursor control character or other
nonprinting character is entered, a printed equivalent will appear on
the screen instead of the cursor movement or other control operation
taking place.  Instead, that action is deferred until the string is
sent to the string by a PRINT statement, at which time the cursor
movement or other control operation will take place.

The exception to this rule is the DELETE key, which will function
normally within quote mode.  The only way to print a character which
is equivalent to the DELETE key is by entering insert mode (see
loctaion 216 ($D8)).  Quote mode may be exited by printing a closing
quote, or by hitting the RETURN or SHIFT-RETURN keys.

Sometimes, it would be handy to be able to escape from quote mode or
insert mode without skipping to a new line.  The machine language
program below hooks into the keyscan interrupt routine, and allows you
to escape quote mode by changing this flag to 0 when you press the f1

Microprocessor Stack Area

Locations 256-511 are reserved for the 6510 microprocessor hardware
stack.  The organization of this temporary storage area has often been
compared to that of a push-down stack of trays at a cafeteria.  The
first number placed on the stack goes to the bottom, and subsequent
entries are placed on top of it.  Then you pull a number off the
stack, you come up with the last number that was pushed on (such a
stack is called a Last In, First Out, or LIFO stack).

The stack is controlled by one of the microprocessor registers called
the Stack Pointer, which keeps track of the last stack location used.
The first number placed on the stack goes to location 511 ($1FF), and
subsequent entries are built downward toward 256 ($100).  If more than
256 numbers are pushed onto the stack, the Stack Pointer will start
counting from 0 again, and an overflow error will result.  Likewise,
if you try to pull more items off the stack than have been pushed on,
an underflow error will result.  Most often, such errors will cause
the system to go haywire, and nothing will operate until you turn the
power off and on again.

The stack is used by the system to keep track of the return addresses
of machine language subroutines and interrupt calls and to save the
contents of internal registers.  The stack can also be used by the
programmer for temporary storage.  BASIC and the Kernal make heavy use
of the stack.

Microsoft BASIC uses part of the stack for a temporary work area.
Therefore, the stack may be broken down into the following subregions:"

Bit 6:  Serial Port (56332, $DC0C) mode (1=output, 0=input)
Bit 7:  Time of Day Clock frequency (1=50 Hz required on TOD pin, 0=60 Hz)

Bits 0-3.  This nybble controls Timer A.  Bit 0 is set to 1 to start
the timer counting down, and set to 0 to stop it.  Bit 3 sets the
timer for one-shot or continuous mode.

In one-shot mode, the timer counts down to 0, sets the counter value
back to the latch value, and then sets Bit 0 back to 0 to stop the
timer.  In continuous mode, it reloads the latch value and starts all
over again.

Bits 1 and 2 allow you to send a signal on Bit 6 of Data Port B when
the timer counts.  Setting Bit 1 to 1 forces this output (which
overrides the Data Direction Register B Bit 6, and the normal Data
Port B value).  Bit 2 allows you to choose the form this output to Bit
6 of Data Port B will take.  Setting Bit 2 to a value of 1 will cause
Bit 6 to toggle to the opposite value when the timer runs down (a
value of 1 will change to 0, and a value of 0 will change to 1).
Setting Bit 2 to a value of 0 will cause a single pulse of a one
machine-cycle duration (about a millionth of a second) to occur.

Bit 4.  This bit is used to load the Timer A counter with the value
that was previously written to the Timer Low and High Byte Registers.
Writing a 1 to this bit will force the load (although there is no data
stored here, and the bit has no significance on a read).

Bit 5.  Bit 5 is used to control just what it is Timer A is counting.
If this bit is set to 1, it counts the microprocessor machine cycles
(which occur at the rate of 1,022,730 cycles per second).  If the bit
is set to 0, the timer counts pulses on the CNT line, which is
connected to pin 4 of the User Port.  This allows you to use the CIA
as a frequency counter or an event counter, or to measure pulse width
or delay times of external signals.

Bit 6.  Whether the Serial Port Register is currently inputting or
outputting data (see the entry for that register at 56332 ($DC0C) for
more information) is controlled by this bit.

Bit 7.  This bit allows you to select from software whether the Time
of Day Clock will use a 50 Hz or 60 Hz signal on the TOD pin in order
to keep accurate time (the 64 uses a 60 Hz signal on that pin)."

Timers A and B Low and High Bytes

These four timer registers (two for each timer) have different
functions depending on whether you are reading from them or writing to
them.  When you read from these registers, you get the present value
of the Timer Counter (which counts down from its initial value to 0).
When you write data to these registers, it is stored in the Timer
Latch, and from there it can be used to load the Timer Counter using
the Force Load bit of Control Register A or B (see 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)
below).

These interval timers can hold a 16-bit number from 0 to 65535, in
normal 6510 low-byte, high-byte format (VALUE=LOW BYTE+256*HIGH BYTE).
Once the Timer Counter is set to an initial value, and the timer is
started, the timer will count down one number every microprocessor
clock cycle.  Since the clock speed of the 64 (using the American NTSC
television standard) is 1,022,730 cycles per second, every count takes
approximately a millionth of a second.  The formula for calculating
the amount of time it will take for the timer to count down from its
latch value to 0 is:

TIME=LATCH VALUE/CLOCK SPEED

where LATCH VALUE is the value written to the low and high timer
registers (LATCH VALUE=TIMER LOW+256*TIMER HIGH), and CLOCK SPEED is
1,022,370 cycles per second for American (NTSC) standard television
monitors, or 985,250 for European (PAL) monitors.

When Timer Counter A or B gets to 0, it will set Bit 0 or 1 in the
Interrupt Control Register at 56333 ($DC0D).  If the timer interrupt
has been enabled (see 56333 ($DC0D)), an IRQ will take place, and the
high bit of the Interrupt Control Register will be set to 1.
Alternately, if the Port B output bit is set, the timer will write
data to Bit 6 or 7 of Port B.  After the timer gets to 0, it will
reload the Timer Latch Value, and either stop or count down again,
depending on whether it is in one-shot or continuous mode (determined
by Bit 3 of the Control Register).

Although usually a timer will be used to count the microprocessor
cycles, Timer A can count either the microprocessor clock cycles or
external pulses on the CTN line, which is connected to pin 4 of the
User Port.

Timer B is even more versatile.  In addition to these two sources,
Timer B can count the number of times that Timer A goes to 0.  By
setting Timer A to count the microprocessor clock, and setting Timer B
to count the number of times that Timer A zeros, you effectively link
the two timers into one 32-bit timer that can count up to 70 minutes
with accuracy within 1/15 second.

In the 64, CIA #1 Timer A is used to generate the interrupt which
drives the routine for reading the keyboard and updating the software
clock.  Both Timers A and B are also used for the timing of the
routines that read and write tape data.  Normally, Timer A is set for
continuous operation, and latched with a value of 149 in the low byte
and 66 in the high byte, for a total Latch Value of 17045.  This means
that it is set to count to 0 every 17045/1022730 seconds, or
approximately 1/60 second.

For tape reads and writes, the tape routines take over the IRQ
vectors.  Even though the tape write routines use the on-chip I/O port
at location 1 for the actual data output to the cassette, reading and
writing to the cassette uses both CIA #1 Timer A and Timer B for
timing the I/O routines."

Bits 0-3 of Control Register A perform for Timer A, except that Timer
B output on Data Port B appears at Bit 7, and not Bit 6.

Bits 5 and 6.  These two bits are used to select what Timer B counts.
If both bits are set to 0, Timer B counts the microprocessor machine
cycles (which occur at the rate of 1,022,730 cycles per second).  If
Bit 6 is set to 0 and Bit 5 is set to 1, Timer B counts pulses on the
CNT line, which is connected to pin 4 of the User Port.  If Bit 6 is
set to 1 and Bit 5 is set to 0, Timer B counts Timer A underflow
pulses, which is to say that it counts the number of times that Timer
A counts down to 0.  This is used to link the two numbers into one
32-bit timer that can count up to 70 minutes with accuracy to within
1/15 second.  Finally, if both bits are set to 1, Timer B counts the
number of times that Timer A counts down to 0 and there is a signal on
the CNT line (pin 4 of the User Port).

Bit 7.  Bit 7 controls what happens when you write to the Time of Day
registers.  If this bit is set to 1, writing to the TOD registers sets
the ALARM time.  If this bit is cleared to 0, writing to the TOD
registers sets the TOD clock.

CIA #1 Register Images

Since the CIA chip requires only enough addressing lines to handle 16
registers, none of the higher bits are decoded when addressing the
256-byte area that has been assigned to it.  The result is that every
16-byte area in this 256-byte block is a mirror of every other.  Even
so, for the sake of clarity in your programs it is advisable to use
the base address of the chip, and not use the higher addresses to
communicate with the chip."

String Garbage Collection

Whenever a string is changed in any way, the revised version of the
text is added to the bottom of the string text area, leaving the old
version higher up in memory, wasting space.

In order to reclaim that space, the descriptor for every string whose
text is in the string text area (rather than in the program text area)
must be searched to find the valid text that is highest in memory.  If
that string is not as high as it could be, it is moved up to replace
any string that is no longer valid.  Then all of the string
descriptors must be searched again to find the next highest string and
move it up.  This continues until every string that is un use has been
covered.  After all have been moved up, the pointer to the bottom of
string text at 51-52 ($33-$34) is changed to show the new bottom
location.

If there are more than a few strings whose text is in the string text
storage area, rather than in the body of the program, scanning every
string as many times as there are strings can take an awful lot of
time.  The computer may seem as if it had died (the STOP key is not
even checked during the procedure).

The collection will take about as long whether there is any spare
space or not; the full collection will be done even if it is done
immediately after the last collection.  Although the increased memory
capacity of the 64 helps to forestall the need for garbage collection,

RS-232 Baud Rate Tables for U.S. Television Standard (NTSC)

This table contains the ten prescaler values for the ten standard baud
rates implemented by the RS-232 Control Register at 659 ($293).  The
table starts with the two values needed for the lowest baud rate (50
baud) and finishes with the entries for the highest baud rate, 2400
baud.  The RS-232 routines are handled by NMI interrupts which are
caused by the timers on CIA #2.  Since the RS-232 device could both
receive and send a bit in a single cycle, the time between interrupts
should be a little less than half of the clock frequency divided by
the baud rate.  The exact formula used is:

((CLOCK/BAUD)/2)-100

where CLOCK is the processor clock speed and BAUD is the baud rate.
The clock frequency for machines using the U.S. television standard
(NTSC) is 1,022,730 cycles per second, while the frequency for the
European (PAL) standard is 985,250 cycles per second.  For this
reason, separate baud rate tables were added for European machines at
58604 ($E4EC)."

Clear Color RAM to the Color in Background Color Register 0

This routine is a patch added to the more recent versions of the
Kernal.  It is called by the routine which clears a screen line
(59903, $E9FF), and it places the color value in Background Color
Register 0 (53281, $D021) into the current byte of Color RAM pointed
to by USER (243, $F3).

In the original version of the Kernal, the routine that cleared a
screen line set the corresponding Color RAM to a value of 1, which
gives text characters a white foreground color.  This was changed when
the white color was found to sometimes cause light flashes during
screen scrolling.  It was that white foreground color, however, that
enabled the user to POKE the screen code for a character into screen
RAM, and make that character appear on the screen in a color that
contrasted the blue background.  This change to the Operating System
causes colors POKEd to screen RAM to be the same color as the
background, and thus they are invisible.

This is a fairly serious problem, because the technique of POKEing
characters to screen RAM has long been a staple of Commodore graphics
programming.  Fortunately, the problem has an easy colution.  Since
the Color RAM will be set to whatevere color is in Background Color
Register 0, what you have to do to initialize Color RAM to the color
you desire is change the background color to the desired foreground
color, clear the screen, and then change the background color back
again:

Pointer: O.S. End of Memory

When the power is first turned on, or a cold start RESET is performed,
the Kernal routine RAMTAS (64848, $FD50) performs a nondestructive
test of RAM from 1024 ($400) up, stopping when the test fails,
indicating the presence of ROM.  This will normally occur at 40960
($A000), the location of the BASIC ROM.  The top of user RAM pointer
is then set to point to that first ROM location.

After BASIC has been started, the system will alter this location only
when an RS-232 channel (device number 2) is OPENed or CLOSEd.  As 512
bytes of memory are required for the RS-232 transmission and reception
buffers, this pointer, as well as the end of BASIC pointer at 55
($37), is lowered to create room for those buffers when the device is
opened.  CLOSing the device resets these pointers.

The start of the routine appears to be a patch that was added to later

the keyboard as the input device and the screen as the output device,
initializes the cursor flash variables, builds the screen line link
table, clears the screen, and homes the cursor.  The new code then
checks the VIC Interrupt register to see if the conditions for a
Raster Compare IRQ have been fulfilled.  Since the Raster Register was
initialized to 311, that can only occur when using a PAL system (NTSC
screens do not have that many scan lines).  The PAL/NTSC register at
678 ($2A6) is set on the basis of the outcome of this test.  The CIA

Number of Characters in Keyboard Buffer (Queue)

The value here indicates the number of charracters waiting in the
keyboard buffer at 631 ($277).  The maximum number of characters in
the keyboard buffer at any one time is determined by the value in
location 649 ($289), which defaults to 10.

If INPUT or GET is executed while there are already characters in the
buffer, those characters will be read as part of the data stream.  You
can prevent this by POKEing a 0 to this location before those
operations, which will always cause any character in the buffer to be
ignored.  This technique can be handy when using the joystick in
Controller Port #1, which sometimes causes fake keypresses to be
registered, placing unwanted characters in the keyboard buffer.

Not only is this location handy for taking unwanted characters out of
the keyboard buffer, but it can also be used to put desired characters
into the buffer, and thus to program the keyboard buffer.  This
technique (dynamic keyboard) allows you to simulate keyboard input in
direct mode from a program.

The dynamic keyboard technique is an extremely useful one, as it
enables you to add, delete, or modify program lines while the program
is running.  The basic scheme is to POKE the PETASCII character values
that you wish to be printed (including cursor control characters and
carriage returns) into the buffer.  Then, when an END statement is
executed, the characters in the buffer will be printed, and entered by
the carriage return.

This technique can help with the problem of trying to use data
separation and terminator characters with INPUT statements.  If you
try to INPUT a string that has a comma or colon, the INPUT will read
only up to that character and issue an EXTRA IGNORED error message.
You can avoid this by entering the input string in quotes, but this
places on the user the burder of remembering the quote marks.  One
solution is to use the statements:

POKE 198,3:POKE 631,34: POKE 632,34: POKE 633,20

before the input.  This will force two quote marks and a delete into
the buffer.  The first quote mark allows the comma or colon to be
INPUT, the second is used to get the editor out of quote mode, and the
delete removes that second quote.

For more specific information and programming examples, see the
description of location 631 ($277), the keyboard buffer."

When the power is first turned on, or a cold start RESET is performed,
the Kernal routine RAMTAS (64848, $FD50) sets this location to point
to address 2048 ($800).  This indicates that this is the starting
address of user RAM.  BASIC uses this location to set its own start of
memory pointer at location 43 ($2B), and thereafter uses only its own
pointer.

The Kernal routine MEMBOT (65076, $FE34) may be used to read or set
this pointer, or these locations may be directly PEEKed or POKEd from
BASIC."

descriptor area is used as a work area, and the dependent variable is
not disturbed (so that if the definition used FN(X), the value of X

Evaluate Expression

This is the beginning point of a very powerful group of subroutines
which are used extensively by BASIC.

The main purpose of these routines is to read in the ASCII text of
BASIC expressions, separate the operators and terms of the expression,
check them for errors, combine the individual terms by performing the
indicated operations, and obtain a single value which the BASIC
program can use.

This can be a very complex task, and expressions an be of the string
or numeric type, and can contain any type of variable, as well as
constants.

At the end, the flag which shows whether the resulting value is string
or numeric at 13 ($D) is set, and if the value is numeric, the flag at
14 ($E) is set as well, to show if it is an integer or floating point
numer."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the memory location at address $E168?","address              $E168          LOAD
Perform LOAD

This routine sets the load address to the start of BASIC (from pointer
at 43 ($2B)), and calls the Kerneal LOAD routine.  If the load is
successful, it relinks the BASIC program so that the links agree with
the address to which it is loaded, and it resets the end of BASIC
pointer to reflect the new end of program text.  If the LOAD was done
while a program was running, the pointers are reset so that the
program starts executing all over again from the beginning.  A CLR is
not performed, so that the variables build so far are retained, and
their values are still accessible.  The pointer to the variable area
is not changed, but if the new program is longer than the one that
loaded it, the variable table will be partially overwritten.  This
will cause errors when the overwritten variables are referenced.
Likewise, strings whose text was referenced at its location within the
original program listing will be incorrect.

Since a LOAD from a program causes the program execution to continue
at the first line, when loading a machine language routine or data
file with a nonrelocating load (for example, LOAD'FILE',8,1) from a
program, you should read a flag and GOTO the line after the LOAD if
you don't want the program to keep rerunning indefinitely:

"In the context of the C64, Give explanations about the kernal","As with the section on the BASIC ROM, this section is not meant to be
a complete explanation of the Kernal ROM, but rather a guidepost for
further exploration.  Where the exact instructions the Kernal ROM
routines use are important to your programming, it will be necessary
for you to obtain a disassembly listing of those routines and look at
the code itself.

Keep in mind that there is 8K of RAM underlying the Kernal ROM that
can be used by turning off interrupts and switching out the Kernal ROM
temporarily.  Even without switching out the Kernal ROM, this RAM may
be read by the VIC-II chip if it is banked to use the top 16K of
memory, and may be used for graphics data.  The Kernal and BASIC ROMs
may be copied to RAM, and the RAM versions modified to change existing
features or add new ones.

There are some differences between the version of the Kernal found on
the first few Commodore 64s and those found on the majority of newer
models.  Those differences are discussed in the entries for the
sections on later Kernal additions (patches) at 58541-58623
($E4AD-$E4FF) an 65371-67407 ($FF5B-$FF7F).

The most obvious change causes the Color RAM at 55296 ($D800) to be
initialized to the background color when the screen is cleared on
newer models, instead of white as on the original models.  Other
changes allow the new Kernal software to be used by either U.S. or
European 64s.  Keep in mind that the Kernal is always subject to
change, and that the following discussion, while accurate at the time
written (mid-1983), may not pertain to later models.  If future
changes are like past ones, however, they are likely to be minor ones.
The first place to look for these changes would be in the patch

CIA #2 Register Images

Since the CIA chip requires only enough addressing lines to handle 16
registers, none of the higher bits are decoded when addressing the
256-byte area that has been assigned to it.  The result is that every
16-byte area in this 256-byte block is a mirror of every other.  For
the sake of clarity in your programs, it is advisable not to use these
addresses.

Location Range: 56832-57087 ($DE00-$DEFF)
Reserved for I/O Expansion

This range of locations is not used directly by the 64's internal
hardware.  It is, however, accessible via pin 7 of the Expansion Port.
It can be used to control cartridges which are connected to this port.
For example, the CP/M module uses this space to control which
microprocessor is in control of the system.  The Z-80 microprocessor
is turned on and off by writing to 56832 ($DE00).

Another cartridge which uses this space is Simon's BASIC.  This 16K
cartridge is addressed at memory locations 32768-49151 ($8000-$BFFF),
which means that it overlaps the regular BASIC ROM at 40960-49151
($A000-$BFFF).  But since it contains additions to BASIC, it must use
the BASIC ROM as well.  This problem is solved by copying the
cartridge at 32768-40959 ($8000-$9FFF) to RAM, and turning the
cartridge on and off by writing to or reading from location 56832
($DE00).

Alternate 53248-57343 ($D000-$DFFF)
Character Generator ROM

The character generator ROM supplies the data which is to form the
shapes of the text and graphics characters that are displayed on the
screen.  Each character requires eight bytes of shape data, and these
eight-byte sequences are arranged in order in which the characters
appear in the screen code chart (see Appendix G).  For example, the
first eight bytes of data in the ROM hold the shape information for
the commercial at sign (@), the next eight hold the shape of the
letter A, etc.  In all, there are 4096 bytes, representing shape data
for two complete character sets of 256 characters each--1K each for
uppercase/graphics, reverse uppercase/reverse graphics, lowercase/
uppercase, and reverse lowercase/reverse uppercase.

The shape of each character is formed by an 8 by 8 matrix of screen
dots.  Whether any of the 64 dots is lit up or not is determined by
the bit patterns of the character data.  Each byte of the Character
ROM holds a number from 0 to 255.  This number can be represented by
eight binary digits of 0 or 1.  The leftmost bit of these eight is
known as Bit 7, while the rightmost bit is called Bit 0.  Each of
these binary digits has a bit value that is two times greater than the
last.  The values of a bit set to 1 in each of the bit places are:

Bit    0    1     2    3    4    5    6    7
Value  1    2     4    8   16   32   64  128

A byte whose value is 255 has every bit set to 1
(128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255), while a byte whose value is 0 is made up
of all zero bits.  Numbers in between are made up of combinations of
bits set to 1 and bits set to 0.  If you think of every bit that holds
0 as a dot on the screen which is the color of the screen background,
and every bit that holds a 1 as a dot whose color is that of the
appropriate nybble in Color RAM, you can begin to get an idea of how
the byte values relate to the shape of the character.  For example, if
you PEEK at the first eight bytes of the character ROM (the technique
is explained in the entry for location 1), you will see the numbers
60, 102, 110, 110, 96, 98, 60, 0.  Breaking these data bytes down into
their bit values gives us a picture that looks like the following:

00111100   0 +   0 +  32 +  16 +   8 +   4 +   0 +   0 =  60
01100110   0 +  64 +  32 +   0 +   0 +   4 +   2 +   0 = 101
01101110   0 +  64 +  32 +   0 +   8 +   4 +   2 +   0 = 110
01101110   0 +  64 +  32 +   0 +   8 +   4 +   2 +   0 = 110
01100000   0 +  64 +  32 +   0 +   0 +   0 +   0 +   0 =  96
01100010   0 +  64 +  32 +   0 +   0 +   0 +   2 +   0 =  98
00111100   0 +   0 +  32 +  16 +   8 +   4 +   0 +   0 =  60
00000000   0 +   0 +   0 +   0 +   0 +   0 +   0 +   0 =   0

If you look closely, you will recognize the shape of the commercial at
sign (@) as it's displayed on your screen.  The first byte of data is
60, and you can see that Bits 5, 4, 3, and 2 are set to 1.  The chart
above shows that the bit values for these bits are 32, 16, 8, and 4.
Adding these together, you get 32+16+8+4=60.  This should give you an
idea of how the byte value corresponds to the patterns of lit dots.
For an even more graphic display, type in the following program, which
shows the shape of any of the 512 characters in the ROM, along with
the number value of each byte of the shape.

If you have read about the VIC-II video chip, you know that it can
address only 16K of memory at a time, and that all display data such
as screen memory, character shape data, and sprite shape data must be
stored within that 16K block.

Since it would be very inconvenient for the VIC-II chip to be able to
access the character data only at the 16K block which includes
adresses 53248-57343 ($D000-$DFFF), the 64 uses an addressing trick
that makes the VIC-II chip see an image of the Character ROM at
4096-8191 ($1000-$1FFF) and at 36864-40959 ($9000-$9FFF).  It is not
available in the other two blocks.  To generate characters in these
blocks, you must supply your own user-defined character set, or copy
the ROM data to RAM.  A machine language routine for doing this is
included in a sample program at the entry for 56576 ($DD00).

As indicated above, you are by no means limited to useing the
character data furnished by the ROM.  The availability of user-defined
characters greatly extends the graphics power of the 64.  It allows
you to create special text characters, like math or chemistry symbols
and foreign language alphabets.  You can also develop special graphics
characters as a substitute for plotting points in bitmap graphics.
You can achieve the same resolution using a custom character as in
high-resolution bitmap mode, but with less memory. Once you have
defined the character, it is much faster to print it to the screen
than in would be to plot out all of the individual points.

To employ user-defined characters, you must first pick a spot to put
the shape data.  This requires choosing a bank of 16K for video chip
memory (see the entry under Bits 0-1 of 56576 ($DD00) for the
considerations involved), and setting the pointer to the 2K area of
character memory in 53272 ($D018).  It is then up to you to supply the
shape data for the characters.  You can use part of the ROM character
set by reading the ROM and transferring the data to your character
shape area (see the entry for location 1 for a method of reading the
ROM).

Your original characters may be created by darkening squares on an 8
by 8 grid, converting all darkened squares to their bit values, and
then adding the bit values for each of the eight bytes.  Or, you may
use one of the many character graphics editor programs that are
available commercially to generate the data interactively by drawing
on the screen.

One graphics mode, multicolor text mode, almost requires that you
define your own character set in order to use it effectively.
Multicolor mode is enabled by Bit 4 of location 53270 ($D016).
Instead of using each bit to control whether an individual dot will be
foreground color (1) or background color (0), that mode breaks down
each byte of shape data in four bit-pairs.  These bit pairs control
whether a dot will be the color in Background Color Register #0 (00),
the color in Background Color Register #1 (01), the color in
Background Color Register #2 (10), or the color in the appropriate
nybble of Color RAM (11).  Since each pair of bits controls one dot,
each character is only four dots across.  To make up for this, each
dot is twice as wide as a normal high-resolution dot."

Timer B (high byte)

Location Range: 56328-56331 ($DC08-$DC0B)
Time of Day Clock (TOD)

In addition to the two general-purpose timers, the 6526 CIA chip has a
special-purpose Time of Day Clock, which keeps time in a format that
humans can understand a little more easily than microseconds.

This Time of Day Clock even has an alarm, which can cause an interrupt
at a specific time.  It is organized in four registers, one each for
hours, minutes, seconds, and tenths of seconds.  Each register reads
out in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) format, for easier conversion to
ASCII digits.  A BCD byte is divided into two nybbles, each of which
represents a single digit in base 10.  Even though a four-bit nybble
can hold a number from 0 to 15, only the base 10 digits of 0-9 are
used.  Therefore, 10 0'clock would be represented by a byte in the
hours register with the nybbles 0001 and 0000, which stand for the
digits 1 and 0.  The binary value of this byte would be 16 (16 times
the high nybble plus the low nybble).  Each of the other registers
operates in the same manner.  In addition, Bit 7 of the hours register
is used as an AM/PM flag.  If that bit is set to 1, it indicates PM,
and if it is set to 0, the time is AM.

The Time of Day Clock Registers can be used for two purposes,
depending on whether you are reading them or writing to them.  If you
are reading them, you will always be reading the time.  There is a
latching feature associated with reading the hours register in order
to solve the problem of the time changing while you are reading the
registers.  For example, if you were reading the hours register just
as the time was changing from 10:59 to 11:00, it is possible that you
would read the 10 in the hours register, and by the time you read the
minutes register it would have changed from 59 to 00.  Therefore, you
would read 10:00 instead of either 10:59 or 11:00.

To prevent this kind of mistake, the Time of Day Clock Registers stop
updating as soon as you read the hours register, and do not start
again until you read the tenths of seconds register.  Of course, the
clock continues to keep time internally even though it does not update
the registers.  If you want to read only minutes, or seconds or tenths
of seconds, there is no problem, and no latching will occur.  But
anytime you read hours, you must follow it by reading tenths of
seconds, even if you don't care about them, or else the registers will
not continue to update.

Writing to these registers either sets the time or the alarm,
depending on the setting of Bit 7 of Control Register B (56335,
$DC0F).  If that bit is set to 1, writing to the Time of Day registers
sets the alarm.  If the bit is set to 0, writing to the Time of Day
registers sets the Time of Day clock.  In either case, as with reading
the registers, there is a latch function.  This function stops the
clock from updating when you write to the hours register.  The clock
will not start again until you write to the tenths of seconds
registers.

The only apparent use of the Time of Day Clock by the 64's Operating
System is in the BASIC RND statement.  There, the seconds and tenths
of seconds registers are read and their values used as part of the
seed value for the RND(0) command.

Nonetheless, this clock can be an invaluable resource for the 64 user.
It will keep time more accurately than the software clock maintained
at locations 60-162 ($A0-$A2) by the Timer A interrupt routine.  And
unlike that software clock, the Time of Day Clock will not be
disturbed when I/O operations disrupt the Timer A IRQ, or when the IRQ
vector is diverted elsewhere.  Not even a cold start RESET will
disrupt the time.  For game timers, just set the time for 00:00:00:0
and it will keep track of elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds and
tenths of seconds format.

The following digital clock program, written in BASIC, will
demonstrate the use of these timers:

Cassette I/O Buffer

This 192-byte buffer area is used to temporarily hold data that is
read from or written to the tape device (device number 1).

When not being used for tape I/O, the cassette buffer has long been a
favorite place for Commodore programmers to place short machine
language routines (although the 64 has 4K of unused RAM above the
BASIC ROM at 49152 ($C000) that would probably better serve the
purpose).

Of more practical interest to the 64 programmer is the possible use of
this area for VIC-II chip graphics memory (for example, sprite shape
data or text character dot data).  If the VIC-II chip is banked to the
lowest 16K of memory (as is the default selection), there is very
little memory space which can be used for such things as sprite shape
data without conflict.  If the tape is not in use, locations 832-895
($340-$37F) can be used as sprite data block number 13, and locations
896-959 ($380-$3BF) can be used as sprite data block number 14.

The types of tape blocks that can be stored here are program header
blocks, data header blocks, and data storage blocks.

The first byte of any kind of block (which is stored at location 828
($33C)) identifies the block type.  Header blocks follow this
identifier byte with the two-byte starting RAM address of the tape
data, the two-byte ending RAM address, and the filename, padded with
blanks so that the total length of the name portion equals 187 bytes.
Data storage blocks have 191 bytes of data following the identifier
byte.  The meanings of the various identifier blocks are as follows:

A value of 1 signifies that the block is the header for a relocatable
program file, while a value of 3 indicates that the block is the
header for a nonrelocatable program file.

A relocatable file is created when a program is SAVEd with a secondary
address of 0 (or any even number), while a nonrelocatable program file
is created if the secondary SAVE address is 1 (or any odd number).
The difference between the two types of files is that a nonrelocatable
program will always load at the address specified in the header.  A
relocatable program will load at the current start of BASIC address
unless the LOAD statement uses a secondary address of 1, in which case
it will also be loaded at the addrss specified in the header.

You should note that a program file uses the cassette buffer only to
store the header block.  Actual program data is transferred directly
to or from RAM, without first being buffered.

An identifier value of 4 means that the block is a data file header.
Such a header block is stored in the cassette buffer whenever a BASIC
program OPENs a tape data file for reading or writing.  Subsequent
data blocks start with an identifier byte of 2.  These blocks contain
the actual data byte written by the PRINT #1 command, and read by the
GET #1 and INPUT #1 commands.  Unlike the body of a program file,
these blocks are temporarily stored in the cassette byffer when being
written or read.

An identifier byte of 5 indicates that this block is the logical end
of the tape.  This signals the Kernal not to search past this point,
even if there are additional tape blocks physically present on the
tape.

Operator Dispatch Vector Table

This table contains two-byte vectors, each of which points to an

For the reasoning behind the one-byte offset to the true address, see
the entry for location 40972 ($A00C).  In addition, each entry has a
one-byte number which indicates the degree of precedence that
operation takes.  Operations with a higher degree of precedence are
performed before operations of a lower degree (for example, in the
expression A=3+4*6, the 4*6 operation is performed first, and 3 is
added to the total).  The order in which they are performed is:

1.  Expressions in parentheses
2.  Exponentation (raising to a power, using the up-arrow symbol)
3.  Negation of an expression (-5, -A)
4.  Multiplication and division
5.  Addition and subtraction
6.  Relation tests (=, <>, <, >, <=, >= all have the same precedence)

Flag: SHIFT/CTRL/Logo Keypress

This flag signals which of the SHIFT, CTRL, or Commodore logo keys are
currently being pressed, if any.

A value of 1 signifies that one of the SHIFT keys is being pressed, a
2 shows that the Commodore logo key is down, and 4 means that the CTRL
key is being pressed.  If more than one key is held down, these values
will be added; for example, a 3 indicates that SHIFT and logo are both
held down.

The value here is used by the Operating System when determining how to
convert a keypress into a PETASCII character.  There are four
different tables used to translate one of the 64 keys on the keyboard
matrix into a PETASCII character, and the combination of special SHIFT
keys determines which of these tables will be used (see the entry for
location 245 ($F5) for more details on the keyboard tables).

Pressing the SHIFT and Commodore logo keys at the same time will
toggle the character set that is presently being used between the
uppercase/graphics set, and the lowercase/uppercase set (provided that
the flag at 657 ($291) has not been set to disable this switch).

This changes the appearance of all of the characters on the screen at
once.  It has nothing whatever to do with the keyboard shift tables,
however, and should not be confused with the printing of SHIFTed
characters, which affects only one character at a time.  Rather, it is
the result of the value of the character dot data table base address
in 53272 ($D018) being changed.  The came result may be obtained by

RND Function Seed Value

This location holds the five-byte floating point value returned by the
RND function.  It is initially set to a seed value copied from ROM
(the five bytes are 128, 79, 199, 82, 88--$80, $4F, $C7, $52, $58).

When the function RND(X) is called, the numeric value of X does not
affect the number returned, but its sign does.  If X is equal to 0,
RND generates a seed value from chip-level hardware timers.  If X is a
positive number, RND(X) will return the next number in an arithmetic
sequence.  This sequence continues for such a long time without
repeating itself, and gives such an even distribution of numbers, that
it can be considered random.  If X is negative, the seed value is
changed to a number that corresponds to a scrambled floating point
representation of the number X itself.

Given a particular seed value, the same pseudorandom series of numbers
will always be returned.  This can be handy for debugging purposes,
but not where you wish to have truly random numbers.

The traditional Commodore method of selecting a random seed is by
using the expression RND(-TI), mostly because RND(0) didn't function
correctly on early PETs.  While the RND(0) form doesn't really work
right on the 64 either (see location 57495 ($E097)), the expression
RND(-RND(0)) may produce a more random seed value.

VIC-II Chip Registers

The Video Interface Controller (VIC-II chip) is a specially designed
processor that is in charge of the 64's video display.  It is this
chip which makes possible the 64's wide range of graphics
capabilities.

The VIC-II chip's ability to address memory is independent of the 6510
microprocessor.  It can address only 16K at a time, and any of the
four blocks of 16K can be chosen for video memory.  The system default
is for it to use the first 16K.

All of the video display memory, character dot data, and sprite shapes
must be stored within the chosen 16K block.  Locations 53248-53294
($D000-$D02E) are registers which allow the user to communicate with
the VIC-II chip.  Although for the most part they can be written to
and read like ordinary memory locations, their contents directly
control the video display.  Since many of these locations work in
close conjunction with others, a general overview of some of the
different graphics systems on the 64 is in order.

The most familiar type of graphics display is the ordinary text that
appears when you turn the machine on.  The area of RAM which is
displayed on the screen is determined by the Video Matrix Base Address
Nybble of the VIC-II Memory Control Register (53272, $D018).  The
address of the dot-data which is used to assign a shape to each text
character based on an 8 by 8 matrix of lit or unlit dots is determined
by the other half of the Memory Control Register at 53272 ($D018).
More information on how the data is used to represent the character
shapes may be found at the alternate entry for 49152 ($C000), the
Character Generator ROM.

Text character graphics may employ one of the two sets of text and
graphics characters in the Character Generator ROM, or the user may
substitute a completely different set of graphics or text characters
in RAM.

Normally, the text graphics screen uses a background color which is
common to all text characters, and that value is stored in Background
Color Register 0 (53281, $D021).  The color of the frame around the
screen is determined by the Border Color Register at 53280 ($D020).

The color of each character is determined by one nybble of the Color
RAM which starts at 55296 ($D800).  There are, however, two variations
which alter this scheme somewhat.

The first is called multicolor text mode, and is set by Bit 4 of 53270
($D016).  Instead of each bit selecting either the foreground or the
background color for each dot in the character, bit-pairs are used to
select one of four colors for each double-width dot.  This results in
the horizontal resolution being cut to four dots across per character,
but allows two extra colors to be introduced from Background Color
Registers 1 and 2 (53282-53283, $D022-$D023).

The other text mode is called Extended Background Color Mode.  In this
mode, the foreground color is always selected by the Color RAM.  The
background color depends on the actual screen code of the character.
In this mode, only the first 64 character shapes are available, but
each can have one of four different background colors.

The background color for each character is determined by its screen
code as follows:

1.  If the screen code is from 0-63 (this includes the normal
alphanumerics), the value in Background Color Register 0 (53281,
$D021) will determine the background color, as is usual.

2.  Characters with codes 64-255 will have the same shape as the
corresponding character in the group with codes 0-63.

3.  For characters with codes 64-127 (SHIFTed characters), the
background colors are deterined by the value in Background Color
Register 1 (53282, $D022).

4.  The value in Background Color Register 2 (53283, $D023) is used
for characters with codes 128-191 (reversed alphanumerics).

5.  For characters with codes 192-255, the value in Background Color
Register 3 (53284, $D024) is used to determine the background color.


In place of the normal text mode, a bitmap graphics mode is also
abailable by setting Bit 5 of location 53265 ($D011).  In this mode,
each bit of data determines whether one dot on the screen will be set
to either the background color or foreground color.  Within an 8 by 8
dot area, the foreground and background colors may be individually
selected.

The bitmap area is 320 dots wide and 200 dots high.  The area which
contains the graphics data, the bitmap, is determined by the Character
Dot Data Base Address in the lower nybble of the VIC-II Memory Control
Register (53272, $D018).  The Video Matrix Base Address in the upper
nybble, which normally determines which area of memory will be
displayed, instead determines where the color memory for each 8 by 8
ground of dots will be located.

The Color RAM is not used for high-resolution bitmap graphics.  But
multicolor mode is also available for bitmap graphics, and it uses the
Color RAM to determine the foreground color of each dot.

As with multicolor text mode, the horizontal resolution is but in half
(to 160 dots across), so that in addition to the foreground and
background colors, each dot can be one of two other colors as well.
This mode gets the value for the two extra colors from the two nybbles
of each byte of bitmap color memory, the location of which is
determined by the Video Matrix Base Address.

Multicolor text mode offers four colors, three of which will be common
to all characters, and one of which can be selected individually.
Multicolor bitmap mode offers a choice of four colors, three of which
can be individually selected within an 8 by 8 dot area.

The 64 also contains an entirely separate graphics system, whose
character shapes, colors, and positions are derived and displayed
without any reference to the Video Matrix and Character Dot-Data
addresses.  Best of all, these characters may be moved quickly and
easily to any position on the screen, greatly facilitating games and
animated graphics of all types.  This system is known as sprite
graphics.

Sprite graphics takes its name from the graphics characters it
displays, each of which is called a sprite.  There are eight sprites,
known as Sprites 0-7.  Each sprite character is 24 dots wide by 21
dots high.  This is about eight times as large as a regular text
character, which is only 8 dots wide by 8 dots high.

A sprite takes its shape from 63 bytes of data in one of the 256 data
blocks, each 64 bytes long, that can fit into the 16K space which the
VIC-II chip can address.  The block currently assigned to any given
sprite is determined by the Sprite Data Pointers, which are located at
the last eight bytes of the screen memory area (the default locations
are 2040-2047, $7F8-$7FF).

The first Sprite Data Pointer determines the data block used for the
shape of Sprite 0, the second for the shape of Sprite 1, etc.  The
number in the pointer times 64 equals the address of the first byte of
the data block within the VIC-II addressing range.

For example, using the default values for VIC-II addressing area and
screen memory, a value of 11 in location 2040 ($7F8) would mean that
the shape of Sprite0 is determined by the data in the 63-byte block
starting at location 704 (11*64).  It should be noted that it is
possible for more than one sprite to take its shape data from the same
block, so that only 64 bytes of data are required to create eight
sprites, each having the same shape.

The dot patterns of each sprite correspond to the bit patterns of the
sprite shape data.  Each byte of shape data in memory consists of a
number from 0 to 255.  This number can be represented by eight binary
digits of 0 or 1.

Each binary digit has a bit value that is two times greater than the
last.  If the digit in the zero bit place is a 1, it has a value of 1
(we count bit places from 0 to 7).  A 1 in the first bit place has a
value of 2, the second bit has a value of 4, the third has a value of
8, the fourth has a vlue of 16, the fifth a value of 32, the sixth a
value of 64, and the seventh a value of 128.

By making all of the possible combinations of 0's and 1's in all eight
bit places, and adding the bit values of every bit place that contains
a 1, we can represent every number from 0 to 255 as a series of 1's
and 0's.

If you think of every 0 as a dot having the same color as the
background, and every 1 as a dot which is the color of the sprite, you
can see how a series of bytes could be used to represent the sprite
shape.

Since each line of the sprite is 24 dots wide, it takes 3 bytes of
memory (24 bits) per line to portray its shape.  Let's take a look at
a couple of sample sprite lines.

00000000 01111110 00000000 = 0, 126, 0

As you can see, the first and last bytes are all 0's, so nothing will
be displayed there.  The middle byte has six 1's, so it will be
displayed as a line six dots long.  By adding the values of these dix
bits (64+32+16+8+4+2), we get a byte value of 126.  Let's try another
line.

00011111 11111111 11111000 = 21, 255, 248

The first byte has five bits set to 1, having values of 16, 8, 4, 2,
and 1, for a total of 31.  The second byte has all bits set to 1, so
it has the maximum value of 255.  The third byte also has five bits
set to 1, having values of 128, 64, 32, 16, and 8, for a total of 248.
The result is that this line of sprite data will display a line that
is 18 dots long.

We can put these two kinds of lines together to show how a large cross
might be drawn using bytes of sprite data."

This register can be used to double the width of any sprite.  Setting
any bit of this register to 1 will cause each dot of the corresponding
sprite shape to be displayed twice as wide as normal, so that without
changing its horizontal resolution, the sprite takes up twice as much
space.  The horizontal expansion feature can be used alone, or in
combination with the vertical expansion register at 53271 ($D017).

Location Range: 53278-53279 ($D01E-$D01F)
Sprite Collision Detection Registers

While Bit 2 of the VIC IRQ Register at 53273 ($D019) is set to 1
anytime two sprites overlap, and Bit 1 is set to 1, when a sprite
shape is touching the foreground text or bit-graphics display, these
registers specify which sprites were involved in the collision.  Every
bit that is set to 1 indicates that the corresponding sprite was
involved in the collision.  Reading these registers clears them so
that they can detect the next collision.  Therefore, if you plan to
make multiple tests on the values stored here, it may be necessary to
copy it to a RAM variable for further reference.

Note that while these registers tell you what sprites were involved in
a collision, they do not necessarily tell you what objects have
collided with each other.  It is quite possible to have three sprites
lined up in a row, where Sprite A is on the left, Sprite B is in the
middle, touching Sprite A, and Sprite C is on the right, touching
Sprite B but not touching Sprite A.  The Sprite-Sprite Collision
register would show that all three are involved.  The only way to make
absolutely certain which collided with which is to check the position
of each sprite, and calculate for each sprite display line if a sprite
of that size would touch either of the others.  As you can imagine,
this is no easy task.

There are a few simple rules concerning what does or does not cause a
collision.  Though the sprite character consists of 504 dots in a 24
by 21 matrix, does which represent data bits that are equal to 0 (or
multicolor bit- pairs equal to 00), and therefore always displayed in
the background color, do not count when it comes to collision.

A collision can occur only if a dot which represents a sprite shape
data bit of 1 touches another dot of nonzero graphics data.  Consider
the case of two invisible sprites.  The first sprite is enabled, its
color set to contrast the background, and it is positioned on the
screen, but its shape data bytes are all 0.  This sprite can never be
involved in a collision, because it displays no nonzero data.  The
second sprite is enabled, positioned on the screen, and its shape
pointer set for a data read that is filled with bytes having a value
of 255.  Even if that sprite's color is set to the same value as the
background color, making the sprite invisible, it can still be
involved in collisions.  The only exception to this rule is the 01
bit-pair of multicolor graphics data.  This bit-pair is considered
part of the background, and the dot it displays can never be involved
in a collision.

The other rule to remember about collisions is that they can occur in
areas that are covered by the screen border.  Collision between
sprites can occur when the sprites are offscreen, and collisions
between sprites and foreground display data can occur when that data
is in an area that is covered by the border due to the reduction of
the display to 38 columns or 24 rows."

Subroutine: Get Next BASIC Text Character

This is actually a machine language subroutine, which at the time of a
BASIC cold start (such as when the power is turned on) is copied from
MOVCHG (58274, $E3A2) in the ROM to this zero page location.

CHRGET is a crucial routine which BASIC uses to read text characters,
such as the text of the BASIC program which is being interpreted.  It
is placed on zero page to make the routine run faster.  Since it keeps
track of the address of the character being read within the routine
itself, the routine must be in RAM in order to update that pointer.
The pointer to the address of the byte currently being read is really
the operand of a LDA instruction.  When entered from CHRGET, the
routine increments the pointer by modifying the operand at TXTPTR
(122, $7A), thus allowing the next character to be read.

Entry at CHRGOT (121, $79) allows the current character to be read
again.  The CHRGET routine skips spaces, sets the various flags or the
status register (.P) to indicate whether the character read was a
digit, statement terminator, or other type of character, and returns
with the retrieved character in the Accumulator (.A).

Since CHRGET is used to read every BASIC statement before it is
executed, and since it is in RAM, and therefore changeable, it makes a
handy place to intercept BASIC to add new features and commands (and
in the older PET line, it was the only way to add such features).
Diversion of the CHRGET routine for this purpose is generally referred
to as a wedge.

Since a wedge can greatly slow down execution speed, mose of the time
it is set up so that it performs its preprocessing functions only when
in direct or immediate mode.  The most well-known example of such a
wedge is the 'Universal DOS Support' program that allows easier
communication with the disk drive command channel.

As this is such a central routine, a disassembly listing is given
below to provide a better understanding of how it works.

115 $73   CHRGET  INC TXTPTR   ; increment low byte of TXTPTR
117 $75           BNE CHRGOT   ; if low byte isn't 0, skip next
119 $77           INC TXTPTR+1 ; increment high byte of TXTPTR
121 $79   CHRGOT  LDA          ; load byte from where TXTPTR points
                               ; entry here does not update TXTPTR,
                               ; allowing you to readl the old byte again
122 $7A   TXTPTR  $0207        ; pointer is really the LDA operand
                               ; TXTPTR+1 points to 512-580 ($200-$250)
                               ; when reading from the input buffer
                               ; in direct mode
124 $7C   POINTB  CMP #$3A     ; carry flag set if > ASCII numeral 9
126 $7E           BCS EXIT     ; character is not a numeral--exit
128 $80           CMP #$20     ; if it is an ASCI space...
130 $82           BEQ CHRGET   ; ignore it and get next character
132 $84           SEC          ; prepare to subtract
133 $85           SBC #$30     ; ASCII 0-9 are between 48-57 ($30-$39)
135 $87           SEC          ; prepare to subtract again
136 $88           SBC #$D0     ; if < ASCII 0 (57, $39) then carry is set
138 $8A   EXIT    RTS          ; carry is clear only for numeral on return

The Accumulator (.A register) holds the character that was read on
exit from the routine.  Status register (.P) bits which can be tested
for on exit are:

  Carry Clear if the character was an ASCII digit 0-9.
  Carry Set, otherwise.
  Zero Set only if the character was a statement terminator 0 or an
ASCII colon, 58 ($3A).
  Zero Clear, otherwise.


One wedge insertion technique is to change CHRGET's INC $7A to a JMP
WEDGE, have your wedge update TXTPTR itself, and then JSR CHRGOT.
Another is to change the CMP #$3A at location 124 ($7C), which I have
labeled POINTB, to a JMP WEDGE, do your wedge processing, and then
exit through the ROM version of POINTB, which is located at 48283
($E3AB).  For more detailed information about wedges, see Programming
the PET/CBM, Raeto Collin West, pages 365-68.

While the wedge is a good, quick technique for adding new commands, a
much more elegant method exists for accomplishing this task on the
VIC-20 and 64 withouth slowing BASIC down to the extent that the wedge
does.  See the entries for the BASIC RAM vector area at 768-779
($300-$30B) for more details."

Vector to Keyboard Table Setup Routine

This location points to the address of the Operating System routine
which actually determines which keyboard matrix lookup table will be
used.

The routine looks at the value of the SHIFT flag at 653 ($28D), and
based on what value it finds there, stores the address of the correct
table to use at location 245 ($F5).

The interrupt driven keyboard-scanning routine jumps through this RAM
vector to get to the table setup routine.  Therefore, it is possible
to alter the address contained in this vector, and direct the keyscan
routine to your own routine, which can check the keypress and SHIFT
combination, and act before a character is printed.

Since this routine comes after the keypress, but before it is printed,
this is a very good place to have your preprocessor routine check for
a particular keypress.  An excellent example of such a program is the
'VICword' program by Mark Niggemann, COMPUTE!'s Second Book of VIC.
This program adds a machine language routine that checks if the SHIFT
or Commodore logo key is pressed while not in quote mode.  If it finds
one of these keypresses, it substitutes an entire BASIC keyword for
the letter (A-Z) of the key that was pressed.  An adaptation of that
program for the 64 appears below.

CLOSE is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered via the jump

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 796 ($31C).  It is used to
close a logical file after all I/O operations involving that file have
been completed.  This is accomplished by loading the Accumulator with
the logical file number of the file to be closed, and calling this
routine.

Closing an RS-232 file will de-allocate space at the top of memory for

cassette, even if it is not a full 192 bytes.  Closing a serial bus
device will send an UNLISTEN command on the bus.  Remember, it is
necessary to properly CLOSE a cassette or disk data file in order to
retrieve the file later.

For all types of files, CLOSE removes the file's entry from the tables

List of Keywords

This table contains a complete list of the reserved BASIC keywords
(those combinations of ASCII text characters that cause BASIC to do
something).  The ASCII text characters of these words are stored in
token number order.  Bit #7 of the last letter of each word is set to
indicate the end of the word (the last letter has 128 added to its
true ASCII value).

When the BASIC program text is stored, this list of words is used to
reduce any keywords to a single-byte value called a token.  The
command PRINT, for example, is not stored in a program as five ASCII
bytes, but rather as the single token 153 ($99).

When the BASIC program is listed, this table is used to convert these
tokens back to ASCII text.  The entries in this table consist of the
following:

1.  The statements found in STMDSP at 40972 ($A00C), in the token
number order indicated (token numbers 128-162).

2.  Some miscellaneous keywords which never begin a BASIC statement:

Token #    Keyword
162 $A3    TAB(
164 $A4    TO
165 $A5    FN
166 $A6    SPC(
167 $A7    THEN
168 $A8    NOT
169 $A9    STEP

3.  The math operators found in OPTAB at 41088 ($A080), in the token
number order indicated (token numbers 170-179).

4.  The functions found in FUNDSP at 41042 ($A052), in the token
number order indicated (token numbers 182-202).

5.  The word GO (token number 203 ($CB)).  This word was added to the
table to make the statement GO TO legal, to afford some compatibility
with the very first PET BASIC, which allowed spaces within keywords.

ASCII Text of BASIC Error Messages

This table contains the ASCII text of all of the BASIC error messages.
As in the keyword table, Bit 7 of the last letter of each message is

Set Up the Proper Keyboard Decode Table

This routine is pointed to by the vector at 655 ($28F).  Its function
is to read the shift/control flag at 653 ($28D), and set the value of
the decode table pointer at 245 ($F5) accordingly.

First it checks if the SHIFT/Commodore logo combination was pressed,
and if the toggle enable at 657 (291) will allow a change, the
character set will be changed to lowercase/uppercase or
uppercase/graphics by changing the VIC Memory Control Register at
53272 ($D018), and no character will be printed.

Next it sets the decode table pointer.  There are 64 keys, and each
can have four different PETASCII values, depending on whether the key
is pressed by itself, or in combination with the SHIFT, CTRL, or
Commodore logo keys.  Therefore, there are four tables of 64 entries
each to translate the keycode to PETASCII:  the standard table, the
SHIFT table, the Commodore logo table, and the CONTROL table.  The
routine will set up the pointer for the appropriate table, depending
on whether the SHIFT, CTRL, or logo key was pressed.  The CTRL key
takes precedence, so that if another of these keys is pressed along
with the CTRL key, the CONTROL table is used."

as ST=4.  A table of status codes for cassette and serial devices
follows below:

Cassette:
Bit 2 (Bit Value of 4) = Short Block
Bit 3 (Bit Value of 8) = Long Block
Bit 4 (Bit Value of 16) = Unrecoverable error (Read), mismatch
Bit 5 (Bit Value of 32) = Checksum error

Bit 1 (Bit Value of 2) = Time out (Read)
Bit 6 (Bit Value of 64) = EOI (End or Identify)
Bit 7 (Bit Value of 128) = Device not present

Probably the most useful bit to test is Bit 6 (end of file).  When

This 4K block of memory is used for several key functions.  Normally,
the 6510 microprocessor addresses the two Complex Interface Adapter
(CIA) Input/Output chips here, along with the VIC-II video controller
chip, the Sound Interface Device (SID) music synthesizer, and the
Color RAM.

Alternatively, the 6510 can address the character ROM here (though
normally only the VIC-II chip has access to it).  Finally, there is
also 4K of RAM here, although to use it may require banking it in only
when necessary, as the I/O devices are needed for such niceties as
reading he keyboard, and updating the screen display.

It will appear from the map of the I/O devices below that many of the
locations are not accounted for.  That is beause these devices tie up
more addressing space than they actually use.  Each of them uses only
a few addresses, mostly on the bit level.

The missing addresses either consist of images of the hardware
registers, or cannot be addressed in this configuration.  In addition,
some address space is left open for the use of future hardware devices
which might be plugged into the expansion port, like the CP/M card.

As mentioned above, memory usage by these I/O devices is to intensive
that to work with them often requires that you turn individual bits on
and off.  Here is a quick reminder of how to manipulate bits.

The bit values for each bit are:

Bit 0 = 1

4K Free RAM

Locations 49152 to 53247 ($C000 to $CFFF) are free RAM.  Since this
area is not contiguous with the BASIC program text RAM area, it is not
available for BASIC program or variable storage (it is not counted in

This area is fully available for any other use, however, sudh as
storing machine language subroutines for use with BASIC, alternate I/O
drivers for parallel or IEEE devices, character graphics or sprite

This large free area is such a tempting spot for system additions that
many such applications may be competing for the same RAM space.  For
example, the Universal Wedge DOS Support program that adds easy access
to the disk communications channel is usually loaded at 52224 ($CC00).
Programs that use that part of RAM will therefore overwrite the DOS
support program, with the result that they may not run correctly, or
even at all.  Likewise, Simon's BASIC, the extended language which

Flag: Was STOP Key Pressed?

This location is updated every 1/60 second during the execution of the
IRQ routine that reads the keyboard and updates the jiffy clock.

The value of the last row of the keyboard matrix is placed here.  That
row contains the STOP key, and although this location is used
primarily to detect when that key has been pressed, it can also detect
when any of the other keys in that row of the matrix have been
pressed.

In reading the keyboard matrix, a bit set to 1 means that no key has
been pressed, while a bit reset to 0 indicates that a key is pressed.
Therefore, the following values indicate the keystrokes detailed
below:

255 $FF  = no key pressed
254 $FE  = 1 key pressed

VIC owners will notice that the 64's keyboard matrix is very different

can test for the STOP key by following a read of this location with a
BPL instruction, which will cause a branch to occur anytime that the
STOP key is pressed."

Register Storage Area

The BASIC SYS command uses this area to store 6510 internal
registers--the Accumulator (.A), the .X and .Y index registers, and
the status register, .P.

Before every SYS command, each of the registers is loaded with the
value found in the corresponding storage address.  After the ML
program finished executing, and returns to BASIC with an RTS
instruction, the new value of each register is stored in the
appropriate storage address.  This is only true of SYS, not of the
similar USR command.

This feature allows you to place the necessary preentry values into
the registers from BASIC before you SYS to a Kernal or BASIC ML
routine.  It also enables you to examine the resulting effect of the
routine on the registers, and to preserve the condition of the
registers on exit for subsequent SYS calls.

An extremely practical application comes immediately to mind.
Although the 64's BASIC 2 has many commands for formatting printed
characters on the monitor screen (for example, TAB, SPC, PRINT A$,B),
there is none to adjust the vertical cursor position.

There is a Kernal routine, PLOT (58634, $E50A), which will allow you
to position the cursor anywhere on the screen.  In order to use it,
you must first clear the carry flag (set it to 0), and then place the
desired horizontal column number in the .Y register and the vertical
row number in the .X register before entering the routine with a SYS
65520.  Using the register storage area, we can print the work HELLO
at row 10, column 5 with the following BASIC line:

POKE 781,10:POKE 782,5:POKE 783,0:SYS 65520:PRINT 'HELLO'

You can also use these locations to help you take advantage of Kernal
routines that return information in the register.  For example, the
SCREEN routine (58629,$E505) returns the number of screen rows int he
.Y register, and the number of columns in the .X register.  Using this
routine, a BASIC program could be written to run on machines with
different screen formats (for example, the 64 and the VIC-20).  Just
PEEK(781) after a SYS 65517 to see how many screen columns the
computer display has."

call to CHRGET will return to the address of the code that executes
the statement (see the table of statement tokens at 40972 ($A00C)).

An invalid token will cause a SYNTAX ERROR.  A character whose ASCII

"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose of the memory location at address $A000 to $BFFF?","Locations 40960 to 49152 ($A000 to $BFFF) are used by the BASIC ROM
when it is selected (which is the default condition).  BASIC is the
64's main program, which is always run if there is no autostart
cartridge inserted at power-up time.  When the 64 tells you READY,
that's BASIC talking.

The BASIC interpreter that comes with the 64 is, aside from being
located in a different memory space, almost identical to the Microsoft
BASIC interpreter found on the VIC-20.  Both of these interpreters are
slightly modified versions of PET BASIC 2.0, also known as PET BASIC
3.0 or Upgrade BASIC, because it was an upgraded version of the BASIC
found on the original PET.

This is a somewhat mixed blessing, because while PET BASIC was, in its
day, quote an advanced language for use with an eight-bit
microprocessor, it lacks several of the features (such as error
trapping) which are now standard on most home computers.  And, of
course, it makes no provision whatever for easy use of the many
graphics and sound capabilities made available by the new dedicated
video and sound support chips.

On the other hand, its faithfulness to the original Commodore BASIC
allows a large body of software to be translated for the 64 with
little change (in most cases, the PET Emulator program from Commodore
will allow you to run PET programs with no changes).  Programming aids
and tricks developed for the PET and VIC will, for the most part,
carry over quite nicely to the 64.  Although there is no official
source code listing of the ROM available from Commodore, this version
of BASIC has been around long enough that it has been thoroughly
disassembled, dissected, and documented by PET users.

The labels used here correspond to those used by Jim Butterfield in
his PET memory maps, which are well-known among PET BASIC users.  They
should, therefore, provide some assistance in locating equivalent
routines on the two machines.  A good description of the workings of
PET BASIC can be found in Programming the PET/CBM by Raeto West.

It is beyond the scope of this book to detail the inner workings of
each routine in the BASIC interpreter.  However, the following summary
of routines and their functions should aid the user who is interested
in calling BASIC routines from his or her own program, or in modifying
the BASIC.

Please keep in mind that the entry and exit points listed for routines
that perform a particular function are to be used as guideposts, and
not absolutes.  In fact, BASIC enters many of these routines from
slightly different places to accomplish different tasks.  Some
subroutines are called by so many commands that it is hard to say
which they belong to.  You will even find that some whole commands are
part of other commands.  Where it is important for you to know the
details of a particular routine, you will need to obtain a disassembly
of that section and look at the machine language program itself.

It should be noted that when BASIC is not neede,d it can be switched
out and the RAM underneath can be accessed by the VIC-II chip and used
for screen graphics.  See location 56576 ($DD00) for more information."

Video Matrix: 25 Lines by 40 Columns

The video matrix is where thext screen characters are stored in RAM.
Normally, the VIC-II chip will treat each byte of memory here as a
screen display code and will display the text character that
corresponds to that byte of code.  The first byte of memory here will
be displayed in the top-left corner of the screen, and subsequent
bytes will be displayed in the columns to the right and the rows below
that character.

It is possible to make text or graphics characters appear on the
screen by POKEing their screen codes directly into this area of RAM.
For example, the letter A has a screen code value of 1.  Therefore,
POKE 1024,1 should make the letter A appear in the top-left corner of
the screen.

However, you should be aware that the most current version of the
Operating System initializes the color RAM which is used for the
foreground color of text characters to the same value as the
background color every time that the screen is cleared.  The result is
that although the POKE will put a blue A on the screen, you won't be
able to see it because it is the same color blue as the background.
This can be remedied by POKEing a different value into color RAM
(which starts at 55296 ($D800)).

A POKE 1024,1:POKE 1024+54272,1 will put a white A in the upper-left
corner of the screen.  The loop

FOR I=0 TO 255:POKE 1024+I,I:POKE 1024+54272+I,1:NEXT

will display all of the characters in white at the top of the screen.
Another solution to the color RAM problem is to fool the Operating
System into initializing the color RAM for you.  If you change the
background color to the desired foreground color before you clear the
screen, color RAM will be set to that color.  Then, all you have to do
is change the background color back to what it was.  This example will
show how it's done:

10 POKE 53281,2:REM BACKGROUND IS RED
20 PRINT CHR$(147):REM CLEAR SCREEN
30 POKE 53281,1:REM BACKGROUND IS WHITE
40 POKE 1024,1:REM RED 'A' APPEARS IN TOP LEFT CORNER"

If a sprite is positioned to appear at a spot on the screen that is
already occupied by text or bitmap graphics, a conflict arises.  The
contents of this register determines which one will be displayed in
such a situation.  If the bit that corresponds to a particular sprite
is set to 0, the sprite will be displayed in front of the foreground
graphics data.  If that bit is set to 1, the foreground data will be
displayed in front of the sprite.  The default value that this
register is set to at power-on is 0, so all sprites start out with
priority over foreground graphics.

Note that for the purpose of priority, the 01 bit-pair of multicolor
graphics modes is considered to display a background color, and
therefore will be shown behind sprite graphics even if the foreground
graphics data takes priority.  Also, between the sprites themselves
there is a fixed priority.  Each sprite has priority over all
higher-number sprites, so that Sprite 0 is displayed in front of all
the others.

The use of priority can aid in creating three-dimensional effects, by
allowing some objects on the screen to pass in front of or behind
other objects."

Bit 7:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 7 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)

Sprite multicolor mode is very similar to text and bitmap multicolor
modes (see Bit 4 of 53270, $D016).  Normally, the color of each dot of
the sprite is controlled by a single bit of sprite shape data.  When
thi mode is enabled for a sprite, by setting the corresponding bit of
this register to 1, the bits of sprite shape data are grouped together
in pairs, with each pair of bits controlling a double-wide dot of the
sprite display.  By sacrificing some of the horizontal resolution (the
sprite, although the same size, is now only 12 dots wide), you gain
the use of two additional colors.  The four possible combinations of
these bit-pairs display dot colors from the following sources:

00 Background Color Register 0 (transparent)
01 Sprite Multicolor Register 0 (53285, $D025)
10 Sprite Color Registers (53287-94, $D027-E)
11 Sprite Multicolor Register 1 (53286, $D026)

Like multicolor text characters, multicolor sprites all share two
color registers.  While each sprite can display three foreground
colors, only one of these colors in unique to that sprite.  The number
of unique colors may be increated by combining more than one sprite
into a single character."

Character ROM Image for VIC-II Chip When Using Memory Bank 0 (Default)

Though the VIC-II chip shares memory with the 6510 processor chip, it
does not always see that memory in exactly the same way as the main
microprocessor.

Although the 6510 accesses RAM at these locations, when the VIC-II is
banked to use the first 16K of RAM (which is the default condition),
it sees the character ROM here (the 6510 cannot access this ROM unless
it is switched into its memory at 49152 ($C000)).  This solves the
riddle of how the VIC-II chip can use the character ROM at 49152
($C000) for character shape data and RAM at 1024 ($400), when it can
only address memory within a 16K range.  It also means that the RAM at
4096-8191 cannot be used for screen display memory or user-defined
character dot data, and sprite data blocks 64-127 are not accessible.

You can verify this by turning on bitmap graphics with the screen
memory set to display addresses from 0 to 8192.  You will see that the
bottom portion of the screen shows all of the text character shapes
stored in the ROM.  For more information on the format of text
character data storage, see the description of the Character ROM at

Voice 1 Sustain/Release Control Register

Bits 0-3:  Select release cycle duration (0-15)
Bits 4-7:  Select sustain volume level (0-15)

Bits 4-7 select the volume level at which the note is sustained.
Following the decay cycle, the volume of the output of voice 1 will
remain at the selected sustain level as long as the gate bit of the
Control Register is set to 1.  The sustain values range from 0, which
chooses no volume, to 15, which sets the output of voice 1 equal to
the peak volume achieved during the attack cycle.

Bits 0-3 determine the length of the release cycle.  This phase, in
which the volume fades from the sustain level to near zero volume,
begins when the gate bit of the Control Register is set to 0 (while
leaving the waveform setting that was previously chosen).  The
duration of this decline in volume corresponds to the number (0-15)
selected in the same way as for the decay value:

0 = 6 milliseconds           8 = 300 milliseconds
1 = 24 milliseconds          9 = 750 milliseconds

IRQ Mask Register

Bit 0:  Enable Raster Compare IRQ (1=interrupt enabled)
Bit 1:  Enable IRQ to occure when sprite collides with display of
  normal
        graphics data (1=interrupt enabled)
Bit 2:  Enable IRQ to occur when two sprites collide (1=interrupt
  enabled)
Bit 3:  Enable light pen to trigger an IRQ (1=interrupt enabled)
Bits 4-7:  Not used

This register is used to enable an IRQ request to occur when one of
the VIC-II chip interrupt conditions is met.  In order to understand
what that means, and how these interrupts can extend the range of
options available to a programmer, you must first understand what an
interrupt is.

An interrupt is a signal given to the microprocessor (the brains of
the computer) that tells it to stop executing its machine language
program (for example, BASIC), and to work on another program for a
short time, perhaps only a fraction of a second.  After finishing the
interrupt program, the computer goes back to executing the main
program, just as if there had never been a detour.

Bit 0.  This bit enables the Raster Compare IRQ.  The conditions for
this IRQ are met when the raster scan reaches the video line indicated
by the value written to the Raster Register at 53266 ($D012) and Bit 7
of 53265 ($D011).  Again, an explanation of the terminology is in
order.

In the normal TV display, a beam of electrons (raster) scans the
screen, starting in the top-left corner, and moving in a straight line
to the right, lighting up appropriate parts of the screen line on the
way.  When it comes to the right edge, the beam moves down a line, and
starts again from the left.  There are 262 such line that are scanned
by the 64 display, 200 of which form the visible screen area.  This
scan updates the complete screen display 60 times every second.

The VIC-II chip keeps track of which line is being scanned, and stores
the scan number in the Raster Register at 53266 and 53265 ($D012 and
$D011).  The Raster Register has two functions.  When read, it tells
what line is presently being scanned.  But when written to, it
designates a particular scan line as the place where a raster
interrupt will occur.

At the exact moment that the raster beam line number equals the number
written to the register, Bit 0 of the status register will be set to
1, showing that the conditions for a Raster Compare Interrupt have
been fulfulled.  If the raster interrupt is enabled then,
simultaneously, the interrupt program will be executed.  This allows
the user to reset any of the VIC-II registers at any point in the
display, and thus change character sets, background color, or graphics
mode for only a part of the screen display.

The interrupt routine will first check if the desired condition is the
source of the interrupt (see above entry) and then make the changes to
the screen display.  Once you have written this interrupt routine, you
must take the following steps to install it.

1.  Set the interrupt disable flag in the status register with an SEI
instruction.  This will disable all interrupts and prevent th system
from crashing while you are changing the interrupt vectors.

2.  Enable the raster interrupt.  This is done by setting Bit 0 of the
VIC- II chip interrupt enable register at location 53274 ($D01A) to 1.

3.  Indicate the scan line on which you want the interrupt to occur by
writing to the raster registers.  Don't forget that this is a nine-bit
value, and you must set both the low byte (in location 53266 ($D012))
and the high bit (in the register at 53265 ($D011)) in order to insure
that the interrupt will start at the scan line you want it to, and not
256 lines earlier or later.

4.  Let the computer know where the machine language routine that you
want the interrupt to execute starts.  This is done by placing the
address in the interrupt vector at locations 788-789 ($314-$315).
This address is split into two parts, a low byte and a high byte, with
the low byte stored at 788.

To calculate the two values for a given address AD, you may use the
formula HIBYTE=INT(AD/156) and LOWBYTE=AD-(HIBYTE*256).  The value
LOWBYTE would go into location 788, and the value HIBYTE would go into
location 789.

5.  Reenable interrupts with a CLI instruction, which clears the
interrupt disable flag on the status register.

When the computer is first turned on, the interrupt vector is set to
point to the normal hardware timer interrupt routine, the one that
advances the jiffy clock and reads the keyboard.  Since this interrupt
routine uses the same vector as the raster interrupt routine, it is
best to turn off the hardware timer interrupt by putting a value of
127 in location 56333 ($DC0D).

If you want the keyboard and jiffy clock to function normally while
your interrupt is enabled, you must preserve the contents of locations
788 and 789 before you change them to point to your new routine.  Then
you must have your interrupt routine jump to the old interrupt routine
exactly once per screen refresh (every 1/60 second).

Another thing that you should keep in mind is that at least two raster
interrupts are required if you want to change only a part of the
screen.  Not only must the interrupt routine change the display, but
it must also set up another raster interrput that will change it back.

The sample program below uses a raster-scan interrupt to divide the
display into three sections.  The first 80 scan lines are in
high-resolution bitmap mode, the next 40 are regular text, and the
last 80 are in multicolor bitmap mode.  The screen will split this way
as soon as a SYS to the routine that turns on the interrupt occurs.
The display will stay split even after the program ends.  Only if you
hit the STOP and RESTORE keys together will the display return to
normal.

The interrupt uses a table of values that are POKEd into four key
locations during each of the three interrupts, as well as values to
determine at what scan lines the interrupt will occur.  The locations
affected are Control Register 1 (53265, $D011), Control Register 2
(53270, $D016), the Memory Control Register (53272, $D018), and
Background Color 0 (53281, $D021).  The data for the interrupt routine
is contained in lines 49152-49276.  Each of these line numbers
corresponds to the locations where the first data byte in the
statement is POKEd into memory.

If you look at lines 49264-49276 of the BASIC program, you will see
REMark statements that explain which VIC-II registers are affected by
the DATA statements in each line.  The number in these DATA
startements appear in the reverse order in which they are put into the
VIC register.  For example, line 49273 holds the data that will go
into Control Register 2.  The last number, 8, is the one that will be
placed into Control Register 2 while the top part of the screen is
displayed.  The first number, 24, is placed into Control Register 2
during the bottom part of the screen display, and changes that portion
of the display to multicolor mode.

The only tricky part in determining which data byte affects which
interrupt comes in line 49264, which holds the data that determines
the scan line at which each interrupt will occur.  Each DATA statement
entry reflects the scan line at which the next interrupt will occur.
The first item in line 49264 is 49.  Even though this is the entry for
the third interrupt, the next to be generates is the first interrupt,
which occurs at the top of the screen.  Likewise, the last data item
of 129 is used during the first interrupt to start the next interrupt
at scan line 129.

Try experimenting with these values to see what results you come up
with.  For example, if you change the number 170 to 210, you will
increase the text area by five lines (40 scan lines).

By changing the values in the data tables, you can alter the effect of
each interrupt.  Change the 20 in line 49276 to 22, and you will get
lowercase text in the middle of the screen.  Change the first 8 in
line 49273 to 24, and you'll get multicolor text in the center window.
Each of these table items may be used exactly like you would use the
corresponding register, in order to change background color, to obtain
text or bitmap graphics, regular or multicolor modes, screen blanking
or extended background color mode.

It is even possible to change the table values during a program, by
POKEing the new value into the memory location where those table
values are stored.  In that way, you can, for example, change the
background color of any of the screen parts while the program is
running.

Besides enabling the creation of mixed graphics-modes screens, the
Raster Compare Interrupt is also useful for creating scrolling zones,
so that some parts of the screen can be fine-scrolled while the rest
remains stationary.

Bit 1 enables the light pen interrupt.  This interrupt can occur when
the light of the raster beam strikes the light-sensitive device in the
pen's tip, causing it to close the fire button switch on joystick
Controller Port #1.

The light pen interrupt affords a method of signaling to a program
that the pen is being held to the screen, and that its position can be
read.  Some light pens provide a push-button switch which grounds one
of the other lines on the joystick port.  This switch can be pressed
by the user as an additional signal that the pen is properly
positioned.  Its location can then be read in the light pen position
registers (53267-8, $D013-4).

Bit 2 enables the sprite-foreground collision interrupt.  This
interrupt can occur if one of the srpte character's dots is touching
one of the dots from the foreground display of either text character
or bitmap graphics.

Bit 3 enables the sprite-sprite collision interrupt, which can occur
if one of the sprite character's dots is touching one of the dots of
another sprite character.

These two interrupts are useful for games, where such collisions often
require that some action be taken immediately.  Once the interrupt
signals that a collision has occurred, the interrupt routine can check
the Sprite- Foreground Collision Register at 53279 ($D01F), or the
Sprite-Sprite Collision Register at 53278 ($D01E), to see which sprite
or sprites are involved in the collision.  See the entry for those
locations for more details on collisions."

the VIC-II chip.  On power-up, it is set to a default value of 8,
which means that the VIC chip Reset line is set for a normal display,
Multicolor Mode is disabled, a 40-column text display is selected, and
no horizontal fine-scroll offset is used.

Bits 0-2.  The first three bits of this chip control vertical fine
scrolling of the screen display.  This feature allows you to smoothly
move the entire text display back and forth, enabling the display area
to act as a window, scrolling over a larger text or character graphics
display.

Since each text character is eight dots wide, moving each character
over one whole character position (known as coarse scrolling) is a
relatively big jump, and the motion looks jerky.  By placing a number
from 1 to 7 into these three bits, you can move the whole screen
display from one to seven dot spaces to the right.

Stepping through values 1 to 7 allows you to smoothly make the
transition from having a character appear at one screen column to
having it appear at the next one over.  To demonstrate this, type in
the following program, LIST, and RUN it.

10 FOR I=1 TO 50:FOR J=0 TO 7
20 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248) OR J:NEXT J,I
30 FOR I=1 TO 50:FOR J=7 TO 0 STEP-1
40 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248) OR J:NEXT J,I

As you can see, after the display has moved over seven dots, it starts
over at its original position.  In order to continue with the scroll,
you must do a coarse scroll every time the value of the scroll bits
goes from 7 to 0, or from 0 to 7.  This is accomplished by moving each
byte of display data on each line over one position, overwriting the
last character, and introducing a new byte of data on the opposite end
of the screen line to replace it.

Obviously, only a machine language program can move all of these bytes
quickly enough to maintain the effect of smooth motion.  The following
BASIC program, however, will give you an idea of what the combination
of fine and coarse scrolling looks like.

10 POKE 53281,0:PRINT CHR$(5);CHR$(147):FOR I=1 TO 5:PRINT CHR$(17):NEXT
20 FOR I=1 TO 30
30 PRINT TAB(I-1)'{UP}{10 SPACES}{UP}'
40 WAIT53265,128:POKE53270,PEEK(53270)AND248:PRINTTAB(I)'AWAY WE GO'
50 FOR J=1 TO 7
60 POKE 53270,(PEEK(53270)AND248)+J
70 FORK=1TO30-I
80 NEXT K,J,I:RUN

Changing the value of the three horizontal scroll bits will affect the
entire screen display.  If you wish to scroll only a portion of the
screen, you will have to use raster interrupts (see 53274 ($D01A)
below) to establish a scroll zone, change the value of these scroll
bits only when that zone is being displayed, and change it back to 0
afterward.

Bit 3.  Bit 3 of this register allows you to cover up the first and
last columns of the screen display with the border.  Since the viewers
cannot see the characters there, they will not be able to see you
insert a new character on the end of the line when you do coarse
scrolling (see explanation of Bits 0-2 above).

Setting this bit to 1 enables the normal 40-column display, while
resetting it to 0 changes the display to 38 columns.  This is a purely
cosmetic aid, and it is not necessary to change the screen to the
smaller size to use the scrolling feature.

Bit 4.  This bit selects multicolor graphics.  The effect of setting
this bit to 1 depends on whether or not the bitmap graphics mode is
also enabled.

If you are not in bitmap mode, and you select multicolor text
character mode by setting this bit to 1, characters with a color
nybble whose value is less than 8 are displyed normally.  There will
be one background color and one foreground color.  But each dot of a
character with a color nybble whose value is over 7 can have any one
of four different colors.

The two colors in the Background Control Registers 1 and 2 (53282-3,
$D022-3) are available in addition to the colors supplied by the Color
RAM.  The price of these extra colors is a reduction in horizontal
resolution.  Instead of each bit controlling one dot, in multicolor
mode a pair of bits control the color of a larger dot.  A pattern of
11 will light it with the color from the lower three bits of color
RAM.  Patterns of 01 and 10 will select the colors from Background
Color Registers 1 and 2, respectively, for the double-width dot.

You can see the effect that setting this bit has by typing in the
following BASIC command line:

POKE 53270,PEEK(53280)OR16:PRINT CHR$(149)'THIS IS MULTICOLOR MODE'

It is obvious from this example that the normal set of text characters
was not made to be used in multicolor mode.  In order to take
advantage of this mode, you will need to design custom four-color
characters.  For more information, see the alternate entry for 53248
($D000), the Character Generator ROM.

If the multicolor and bitmap enable bits are both set to 1, the result
is a multicolor bitmap mode.  As in multicolor text mode, pairs of
graphics data bits are used to set each dot in a 4 by 8 matrix to one
of four colors.  This results in a reduction of the horizontal
resolution to 160 double-wide dots across.  But while text multicolor
mode allows only one of the four colors to be set individually for
each 4 by 8 dot area, bitmap multicolor mode allows up to three
different colors to be individually selected in each 4 by 8 dot area.
The source of the dot color for each bit-pair combination is shown
below:

00 Background Color Register 0 (53281, $D021)
01 Upper four bits of Video Matrix
10 Lower four bits of Video Matrix
11 Color RAM nybble (area starts at 55296 ($D800))

The fact that bit-pairs are used in this mode changes the strategy for
plotting somewhat.  In order to find the byte BY in which the desired
bit-pair resides, you must multiply the horizontal position X, which
has a value of 0- 159, by 2, and then use the same formula as for
hi-res bitmap mode.

Given that the horizontal position (0-159) of the dot is stored in the
variable X, its vertical position is in the variable Y, and the base
address of the bitmap area ia in the variable BASE, you can find the
desired byte with the formula:

BY=BASE+(Y AND 248)*40+(Y AND 7)+(2*X AND 504)

Setting the desired bit-pair will depend on what color you chose.
First, you must set up an array of bit masks.

CA(0)=1:CA(1)=4:CA(2)=16:CA(3)=64

To turn on the desired dot, select a color CO from 0 to 3
(representing the color selected by the corresponding bit pattern) and
execute the following statement:

BI=(NOT X AND 3):POKE BY,PEEK(BY) AND (NOT 3*CA(BI)) OR (CO*CA(BI))

The following program will demonstrate this technique:

Bit 5:  Bit 5 controls the VIC-II chip Reset line.  Setting this bit
to 1 will completely stop the video chip from operating.  On older
64s, the screen will go black.  It should always be set to 0 to insure
normal operation of the chip.

Bits 6 and 7.  These bits are not used.

This register can be used to double the height of any sprite.  When
the bit in this register that corresponds to a particular sprite is
set to 1, each dot of the 24 by 21 sprite dot matrix will become two
raster scan lines high instead of one."

VIC-II Chip Memory Control Register

Bit 0:  Unused
Bits 1-3:  Text character dot-data base address within VIC-II address
  space
Bits 4-7:  Video matrix base address within VIC-II address space

This register affects virtually all graphics operations.  It
determines the vase address of two very important data areas, the
Video Matrix, and the Character Dot-Data area.

Bits 1-3.  These bits are used to set the location of the Character
Dot-Data area.  This area is where the data is stored (for more
information on character shape data, see the alternate entry for
location 53248 ($D000), the Character Generator ROM).

Bits 1-3 can represent any even number from 0 to 14.  That numer
stands for the even 1K offset of the character data area from the
beginning of VIC-II memory.  For example, if these bits are all set to
0, it means that the character memory occupies the first 2K of VIC-II
memory.  If they equal 2, the data area starts 2*1K (2*1024) or 2048
bytes from the beginning of VIC memory.

The default value of this nybble is 4.  This sets the address of the
Character Dot-Data area to 4096 ($1000), which is the starting address
of where the VIC-II chip addresses the Character ROM.  The normal
character set which contains uppercase and graphics occupies the first
2K of that ROM.  The alternate character set which contains both
upper- and lowercase letters use the second 2K.  Therefore, to shift
to the alternate character set, you must change the value of this
nybble to 6, with a POKE 53272,PEEK(53272)OR2.  To change it back,
POKE 53272,PEEK(53272)AND253.

In bitmap mode, the lower nybble controls the location of the bitmap
screen data.  Since this data area can start only at an offset of 0 or
8K from the beginning of VIC-II memory, only Bit 3 of the Memory
Control Register is significant in bitmap mode.  If Bit 3 holds a 0,
the offset is 0, and if it holds a 1, the offset is 8192 (8K).

Bits 4-7.  This nybble determines the starting address of the Video
Matrix area.  This is the 1024-byte area of memory which contains the
screen codes for the text characters that are displayed on the screen.
In addition, the last eight bytes of this area are used as pointers
which designate which 64- byte block of VIC-II memory will be used as
shape data for each sprite.

These four bits can represent numbers from 0 to 15.  These numbers
stand for the offset (in 1K increments) from the beginning of VIC-II
memory to the Video Matrix.

For example, the default bit pattern is 0001.  This indicates that the
Video Matrix is offset by 1K from the beginning of VIC-II memory, the
normal starting place for screen memory.  Remember, though, the bit
value of this number will be 16 times what the bit pattern indicates,
because we are dealing with Bits 4-7.  Therefore, the 0001 in the
upper nybble has a value of 16.

Using this register, we can move the start of screen memory to any 1K
boundary within the 16K VIC-II memory area.  Just changing this
register, however, is not enough if you want to use the BASIC line
editor.  The editor looks to location 648 ($288) to determine where to
print screen characters.

If you just change the location of the Video Matrix without changing
the value in 648, BASIC will continue to print characters in the
memory area starting at 1024, even though that area is no longer being
displayed.  The result is that you will not be able to see anything
that you type in on the keyboard.  To fix this, you must POKE 648 with
the page number of the starting address of screen memory (page
number=location/256).  Remember, the actual starting address of screen
memory depends not only on the offset from the beginning of VIC-II
memory in the register, but also on which bank of 16K is used for
VIC-II memory.

For example, if the screen area starts 1024 bytes from the beginning
of VIC- II memory, and the video chip is using Bank 2 (32768-49151),
the actual starting address of screen memory is 32768+1024=33792
($8400).  For examples of how to change the video memory area, and of
how to relocate the screen, see the entro for 56576 ($DD00).

53273         $D019          VICIRQ
VIC Interrupt Flag Register

Bit 0:  Flag:  Is the Raster Compare a possible source of an IRQ?
        (1=yes)
Bit 1:  Flag:  Is a collision between a sprite and the normal graphics
        display a possible source of an IRQ?  (1=yes)
Bit 2:  Flag:  Is a collision between two sprites a possible source of
        an IRQ?  (1=yes)
Bit 3:  Flag:  Is the light pen trigger a possible source of an IRQ?
        (1=yes)
Bits 4-6:  Not used
Bit 7:  Flag:  Is there any VIC-II chip IRQ source which could cause
        an IRQ?  (1=yes)

The VIC-II chip is capable of generating a maskable request (IRQ) when
certain conditions relating to the video display are fulfilled.
Briefly, the conditions that can cause a VIC-II chip IRQ are:

1.  The line number of the current screen line being scanned by the
raster is the same as the line number value written to the Raster
Register (53266, $D012).

2.  A sprite is positioned at the same location where normal graphics
data are being displayed.

3.  Two sprites are positioned so that they are touching.

4.  The light sensor on the light pen has been struck by the raster
beam, causing the fire button switch on joystick Control Port #1 to
close (pressing the joystick fire button can have the same effect).

When one of these conditions is met, the corresponding bit in this
status register is set to 1 and latched.  That means that as long as
the corresponding enable bit in the VIC IRQ Mask register is set to 1,
and IRQ requested will be generated, and any subsequent fulfillment of
the same condition will be ignored until the latch is cleared.

This allows you to preserve multiple interrupt requests if more than
one of the interrupt conditions is met at a time.  In order to keep an
IRQ source from generating another request after it has been serviced,
and to enable subsequent interrupt conditions to be detected, the
interrupt service routine must write a 1 to the corresponding bit.
This will clear the latch for that bit.  The default value written to
this register is 15, which clears all interrupts.

There is only 1 IRQ vector that points to the address of the routine
that will be executed when an IRQ interrupt occurs.  The same routine
will therefore be executed regardless of the source of the interrupt.
This status register provides a method for that routine to check what
the source of the IRQ was, so that the routine can take appropriate
action.  First, the routine can check Bit 7.  Anytime that any of the
other bits in the status register is set to 1, Bit 7 will also be set.
Therefore, if that bit holds a 1, you know that the VIC-II chip
requested an IRQ (the two CIA chips which are the other sources of IRQ
interrupts can be checked in a similar manner).  Once it has been
determined that the VIC chip is responsible for the IRQ, the
individual bits can be tested to see which of the IRQ conditions have
been met.

For more information, and a sample VIC IRQ program, see the following
entry.

Voice 1 Attack/Decay Register

Bits 0-3:  Select decay cycle duration (0-15)
Bits 4-7:  Select attack cycle duration (0-15)

Bits 4-7 control the duration of the attack cycle.  This is the period
of time over which the volume will rise from 0 to its peak amplitude.
There are 16 durations which may be selected.  The way in which the
number placed here corresponds to the elapsed time of this cycle is as
follows:

0 = 2 milliseconds           8 = 100 milliseconds
1 = 8 milliseconds           9 = 250 milliseconds
2 = 16 milliseconds         10 = 500 milliseconds
3 = 24 milliseconds         11 = 800 milliseconds
4 = 38 milliseconds         12 = 1 second
5 = 56 milliseconds         13 = 3 seconds
6 = 68 milliseconds         14 = 5 seconds
7 = 80 milliseconds         15 = 8 seconds

Bits 0-3 control the length of the decay phase, in which the volume of
the note declines from the peak reached in the attack phase to the
sustain level.  The number selected corresponds to the length of this
phase as shown below:

0 = 6 milliseconds           8 = 300 milliseconds
1 = 24 milliseconds          9 = 750 milliseconds
2 = 48 milliseconds         10 = 1.5 seconds
3 = 72 milliseconds         11 = 2.4 seconds
4 = 114 milliseconds        12 = 3 seconds
5 = 168 milliseconds        13 = 9 seconds
6 = 204 milliseconds        14 = 15 seconds
7 = 240 milliseconds        15 = 24 seconds

Since the two functions share one register, you must multiply the
attack value by 16 and add it to the decay value in order to come up
with the number to be placed in the register:

BASIC Indirect Vector Table

Several important BASIC routines are vectored through RAM.  This means
that the first instruction executed by the routine is an indirect jump
to a location pointed to by one of the vectors in this table.

On power up, the system sets these vectors to point to the next
instruction past the original JuMP instruction.  The routine then
continues with that instruction as if the jump never took place.  For
example, the BASIC error message routine starts at 42039 ($A437) with
the instruction JMP ($300).  The indirect vector at 768 ($300) points
to 42042 ($A43A), which is the instruction immediately following JMP
($300).

Although this may seem like a fancy way of accomplishing nothing,
using these indirect vectors serves two important purposes.  First, it
allows you to use these important BASIC routines without knowing their
addresses in the BASIC ROM.

For example, the routine to LIST the ASCII text of the single-byte
BASIC program token that is currently in the Accumulator (.A) is
located at one address in the VIC, and another in the 64.  On future
Commodore computers it may be found at still another location.  Yet as
long as the routine is vectored in RAM at 774 ($306), the statement
QP=PEEK(774)+256*PEEK(775) would find the address of that routine on
any of the machines.  Thus, entering such routines through RAM vectors
rather than a direct jump into the ROMs helps to keep your programs
compatible with different machines.

The other important effect of having these vectors in RAM is that you
can alter them.  In that way, you can redirect these important BASIC
routines to execute your own preprocessing routines first.

If you wanted to add commands to BASIC, for example, how would you go
about it?  First, you would need to change the BASIC routines that
convert ASCII program text to tokenized program format, so that when a
line of program text was entered, the new keyword would be stored as a
token.

Next, you would need to change the routine that executes tokens, so
that when the interpreter comes to your new keyword token, it will
take the proper action.

You would also have to change the routine that converts tokens back to
ASCII text, so that your program would LIST the token out correctly.
And you might want to alter the routine that prints error messages, to
add new messages for your keyword.

As you will see, vectors to all of these routines can be found in the
following indirect vector table.  Changing these vectors is a much
more elegant and efficient solution than the old wedge technique
discussed at location 115 ($73)"

Byte Indices to the Beginning and End of Receive and Transmit Buffers

The two 256-byte First In, First Out (FIFO) buffers for RS-232 data
reception and transmission are dynamic wraparound buffers.  This means
that the starting point and the ending point of the buffer can change
over time, and either point can be anywhere withing the buffer.  If,
for example, the starting point is at byte 100, the buffer will fill
towards byte 255, at which point it will wrap around to byte 0 again.
To maintain this system, the following four locations are used as
indices to the starting and the ending point of each buffer."

Control Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the Control keyboard,
one for each key which is struck while the CTRL key is pressed.  The
table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the
correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255
($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value
of 64, no key pressed).

The only keys generally struck in combination with the CTRL key are
the ones that change the colors on the top row of the keyboard, but
this doesn't necessarily mean that the other CTRL key combinations
don't do anything.  On the contrary, looking at the values in this
table, you can see that any of the first 32 values in the PETASCII
table can be produced by some combination of the CTRL key and another
key.  CTRL-@ produces a CHR$(0).  CTRL-A through CTRL-Z produce
CHR$(1) through CHR$(26).  Ctrl-: is the same as CHR$(27), CTRL-Lira
(that's the slashed-L British pound sign) produces CHR$(28), CTRL-;
equals CHR$(29), CTRL-up arrow produces CHR$(30), and CTRL-= produces
CHR$(31).

Any of these combinations produce the same effect as the CHR$(X)
statement.  For examble, CTRL-; moves the cursor over to the right,
CTRL-N switches to lowercase, CTRL-R turns on reverse video, and
CTRL-E changes the printing to white."

Warm Start Vector

The warm start vector points to the address of the routines used to
reset BASIC after the STOP/RESTORE key combination is pressed.  This
is the same address to which the BRK instruction is vectored.  When
BASIC is entered through this vector, the program in memory is not
disturbed.  For more information, see the entry for 58235 ($E37B), the
current warm start entry point."

BASIC Program Text

This is the area where the actual BASIC program text is stored.  The
text of a BASIC program consists of linked lines of program tokens.
Each line contains the following:

1.  A two-byte pointer to the address of the next program line (in
standard low-byte, high-byte order).  After the last program line, a
link pointer consisting of two zeros marks the end of the program.

2.  A two-byte line number (also in low-byte, high-byte order).

3.  The program commands.  Each keyword is stored as a one-byte
character whose value is equal to or greater than 128.  Print, for
example, is stored as the number 151.  Other elements of the BASIC
command, such as the variable names, string literals ('HELLO'), and
numbers, are stored using their ASCII equivalents.

4.  A 0 character, which acts as a line terminator.  In order for
BASIC to work correctly, the first character of the BASIC text area
must be 0.

A quick review of the BASIC pointers starting at 43 ($2B) reveals that
the layout of the BASIC program area (going from lower memory
addresses to higher) is as follows:

BASIC Program Text
Non-Array Variables and String Descriptors
Array Variables
Free Area (Reported by FRE(0))
String Text Area (Strings build from top of memory down into free area)
BASIC ROM

It is interesting to note that the NEW command does not zero out the
text area but rather replaces the first link address in the BASIC
program with two zeros, indicating the end of the program.  Therefore,
you can recover a program from a NEW by replacing the first link
adress, finding the address of the two zeros that actually mark the
end of the program, and setting the pointers at 45, 47, and 49 (which
all point to the end of a BASIC program before the program is RUN) to
the byte following these zeros."

Output to the Screen

This is the main entry point for the part of CHROUT that handles
output to the screen device.  It takes an ASCII character number, and
tests if the character is printable.  If it is, it prints it (taking
into consideration the reverse flag, if any inserts are left, etc.).
If it is a nonprinting character, the routine performs the appropriate
cursor movement, color change, screen clearing, or whatever else might
be indicated."
"In the context of the C64, What is the importance of delaying the reading of the POT register in the C64 and C128 when using a mouse driver, and how can it be ensured?","SID Register Cautions

In  the  C64 & C128,  the  SID  POT  lines  are connected to both
joystick  ports.  A 4066 analog switch is used  to switch the POT
lines  between  the  two  ports based on one of the keyboard scan
lines.  This  means that the normal keyscan interrupt temporarily
affects the values returned in the POT registers.  Therefore,  in
order  to  perform  reliable  conversions,  the POT lines must be
connected  to  the mouse for a period >1.6 millisecond before the
value in the POT register is valid.

The best way to insure this is to wedge the mouse driver software
into the IRQ handler prior  to the polled keyscan.  This more-or-
less assures that the keyscan lines have been sufficiently stable
before the POT register is read by the mouse drivers."

"In the context of the C64, What is the operational mode of a mouse that tracks movement internally and transmits position data to the SID POTX and POTY registers every 512 microseconds without requiring software intervention?","Proportional Mode

In proportional mode the mouse operates as follows:
1) Mouse  movement  is  tracked internally within the mouse.  The
   position of the mouse MOD 64  is  transmitted to the SID  POTX
   and  POTY  registers  every  512  microsecond  and requires no
   software intervention.
   The  POTX  register  is  used  to read X position of the mouse
   and the POTY register is used to read Y position of the mouse.
   The register contents are as follows:

                    +-------------------------------+
   Bit Position     | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
                    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   POT Register     | X | P5| P4| P3| P2| P1| P0| N |
                    +-------------------------------+
   where:
        X ......... is a don't care bit.
        P5-P0 ..... is the mouse position MOD 64.
        N ......... is a special (noise) bit (keep reading...).

2) The  left  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be the fire
   button on a joystick.
3) The  right  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be that UP
   direction on a joystick.

Software Interface

1) Because  the  left and right buttons appear as joystick lines,
   reading  them  from  software is a simple exercise in polling.
   Note that as with a joystick,  the buttons will interfere with
   the  keyboard  map,  and  software  should make some effort to
   distinguish between point short in the keyboard matrix  (i.e.,
   a  key  being  depressed),  and  a  whole  row or column being
   grounded (i.e., a joystick type of signal).
2) The  position information is not difficult to handle.  Ideally
   is  should be installed as part of the 60 Hz interrupt routine
   (preferably  at  the  beginning  --  see  the  section  on SID
   Register Cautions).
   This strategy is as follows:
   1) Read the mouse position MOD 64.
   2) Determine  if  the mouse has moved by comparing the current
      position with a saved copy of the previous position.
   3) If  the mouse has moved,  then modify your pointer position
      appropriately.
      You  should  note,  that even if the mouse is still,  it is
      possible for the POT register  to oscillate between $80 and
      $7F.  This  would result in the mouse position as jittering
      between two points.

In  order  to  ascertain  whether  the mouse has moved the software
should read the low order bit of the POT register.

All of this can be seen in the supplied mouse driver code."
"In the context of the C64, How does the mouse operate in joystick mode?","In joystick mode the mouse operates as follows:
1) If the mouse is moved, then the appropriate joystick lines are
   activated for a period of 20 ms. Thus moving the mouse is like
   pushing the joystick in the appropriate direction.
2) The  left  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be the fire
   button on a joystick.
3) The  right  mouse button is mapped into the SID POTX register.
   If  the  button  is depressed  then the SID POTX register will
   contain a number <$80. If the button is not depressed then SID
   POTX will contain a number >=$80.
4) See the section on SID Register Cautions.

Software Interface

For  most  applications,  the  interface for joystick mode should
be  just  as  any joystick driver, and the right button should be
ignored."
"In the context of the C64, What are the features and modes of operation of the Commodore 1351 Mouse(TM)?","The  Commodore  1351  Mouse(TM)  is a controller designed for use
with  the  Commodore 64(R)  or  Commodore 128(TM)  computers.  It
features two buttons on the top, and a ball on the underside that
is rolled upon a flat surface to manipulate onscreen activity.

The  mouse  has  two  modes  of  operation  --  joystick mode and
proportional mode.

In  joystick  mode,  the  mouse  emulates  a  joystick and can be
used  with all joystick-compatible  software.  In this mode,  the
left  button  is  the fire button and the right button is usually
ignored.

In   proportional  mode,  the  mouse  uses  a  new  technique  to
communicate   mouse   movement  to  the  controlling  application
software.  That requires  the software to know the mouse is there
and  how to read it.  For example,  the GEOS(TM) operating system
can  use  many  different  input  drivers.  One  of  them  is the
Commodore  Mouse  driver,  which  can  be  used  with the 1351 in
proportional mode.

The  1351  provides a proportional mode  so that applications can
have a fast,  responsive pointer that moves easily on the screen.
Joystick mode acts as a fallback for those for those applications
that don't have installable device drivers. You can therefore use
the mouse as a joystick for older software, and take advantage of
the   benefits   provided   by   proportional   mode  with  newer
applications.

The mouse automatically powers up in proportional mode. To choose
joystick mode,  plug  the  mouse into either joystick port on the
side  of  the  computer  and  hold  down the right button  as the
computer is powered up."
"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to clean a computer mouse?","Mouse Cleaning

Since the ball of your mouse roll freely to accurately manipulate
the cursor  (or whatever) on the screen,  it's important that the
ball remains free of dirt or debris.  This is easily accomplished
by sliding out the plastic piece holding the ball in place.


Remove  the  ball  and  wipe  it off with a soft cloth, such as a
handkerchief.


To remove any dirt or dust  from the ball area,  just blow gently
into the opening.  Around the top of the opening, there are three
metal rollers. To clean these, take cotton-tipped swab, moistened
with head cleaning fluid or alcohol, and gently clean the surface
of each roller.  Replace the ball inside the controller  and snap
the plastic piece back on."
"In the context of the C64, What are the features and operating modes of the Commodore 1351 mouse for use with the C64/C128 product line?","The  Commodore 1351 mouse  for use with the C64/C128 product line
is a small two-button device  which is connected to either of the
joystick ports on the C64/C128.

The mouse supports two distinct operating modes:
1) Joystick mode.
2) Proportional mode.

Proportional  mode  is  usable  with  the  C64  or the C128,  and
requires  a  special  machine  language  driver  to yield optimum
performance.

Mode selection is determined when the mouse is powered up. If the
user  depresses the right mouse button when the device is powered
up, then the mouse will be in joystick mode.

If  the  user  does  not  depress the right mouse button when the
device is powered up, then the mouse will default to proportional
mode.

Joystick  mode allows you to utilize the mouse as a joystick when
using software which does not support proportional mode."
"In the context of the C64, What are some important tips for the proper care and use of a computer mouse?","Mouse Tips

Proper care and use of your mouse requires common sense.

Use your mouse on a clean, smooth surface.

Make  sure  you  have  adequate  desktop space to manipulate your
mouse, so you don't have to constantly pick up and reposition it.

Don't  hold  the mouse by its cord,  or let the body of the mouse
hang off the table."

"In the context of the C64, What is a humorous way to brag about the amount of RAM in a computer to an Apple user?","RAM Expansion
Wanna show off to that overinflated 48K Apple user next door. Try this on 'im.
sys 54295 ;BASIC4.0
Of course you know there can't possibly be that much, but how's he gonna know. Stay sharp though - he may know his Apple ROMs with equal impunity."
"In the context of the C64, What is the purpose and usage of the SYS command in Commodore BASIC, and how can it be used to report the current line number or convert hexadecimal to decimal?","Instant BASIC Monitor
You can execute this SYS directly, but it won't mean much. However, put on the end of some line in your program and itwill report what line that is. It's part of the error message routine - the part that reports the line number after a run is interrupted. For example: ?syntax error in 6010.
Immediately upon entering direct mode, the operating sys tem deposits an FF into the high order byte of the Current Line Number word, thus rendering that information mean ingless. During program execution, the current line being executed is copied here. Try this:
100 print 'line 100' 110 print 'some line ' : sys 53112:?
120sys53112
130 goto 100

For C64 it's SYS 48585 and the VIC 20 is 56777. As you can see, if the program is renumbered, the message in line 100 will need updating. The ROM call, however, is universal. You can skip the 'in' display by adding 7 to the address.
Taking this one baby step further, this routine could be used as a primitive hex to decimal converter. For example:
poke 55, 10: poke 54, 7: sys 53119
. . .would print the decimal equivalent of $0A07. (C64/ VIC20: use 58 and 57 for the POKE addresses, with the above SYS address + 7) This is ok when you can convert the low order and high order to decimal in your head. When numbers get like CF7D it's a little tougher. Perhaps some one with BASIC 4.0 (built-in MLM) will investigate a more sophisticated approach to the same end. (Dave Hook, you there? You did that once long ago, did you not?)"
"In the context of the C64, What are some creative ways to deter software pirates and protect your program from being cracked?","Pirate Peeves
Want to drive program pirates crazy. You must admit, if a burglar really wants in, he'll get in no matter how much protection you have. Program pirates are no different. The idea is to make them work for it. As they remove one lock, you check for it later in the program and throw them a couple of knuckle balls. Here's a couple of knuckle balls:
poke 175, 3
. . .switches the input device from the keyboard to the screen. ForVIC20/C64 use poke 153,3. Of course the pirate will remove this rather unsophisticated excuse for protec tion. So, you check for it. Then execute:
sys 57441
This turns off the keyboard completely except for carriage returns. It has no VIC20/C64 equivalent. The point is, if you make it appear as though the more they unprotect your software, the more foul it behaves, pretty soon they'll be replacing the protection they removed just so they can use it. The Transactor will be devoting an entire issue to soft ware protection and piracy in August 1984. Watch for it."
"In the context of the C64, What are some important considerations and guidelines for formatting and using a Commodore hard disk drive?","Hard Disk Formatting
If you have any plans to install a Commodore hard disk drive, chances are the first command you send to it will be a New or HEADER operation. Disk users will know that this formating procedure is necessary to prepare the unit for all future operations. But once you get it started, you might as well find something else to do for a while like learn to play piano or re-build the engine in your car. A Header opera tion on the hard disk can take as long as 1 hour 45 minutes because the ID you select is recorded on every sector header.
You need only do this once unless you wish to change the ID. A Header without the ID merely clears the BAM (Block Allocation Map) and the directory - the rest of the disk is left untouched. If you do decide a re-format is necessary, just remember it will take a while.
Two other hard disk notes: The unit should never be moved while the cylinder is spinning. It takes a minute or so for the cylinder to come to a complete stop after power-down. When moving it, keep the unit level - don't set it on end or its side. Hard disks should be kept on a good solid surface during operation. Even small vibrations can cause undue wear on the disk bearings. Avoid sheifs, tables with long legs or spots that may get bumped by passers-by.
Lastly, Commodore hard disks don't have a drive 0 and drive 1 - only drive 0. Some software packages assume you have a dual floppy and will attempt to access drive 1. Even BASIC tries to read drive 1 when you give a Catalog or Directory command with no drive specified. If you're experi encing any trouble, just slip in a ',D0' or '0:'."
"In the context of the C64, What are some handy methods and user-defined functions for working with inverse trigonometric functions and trigonometric functions in degrees?","INVERSE TRIGNOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Here are a couple of handy methods of obtaining are sine and arc
cosine (remember, the result will be in radians).
ASNX = ATN (X/SQR(1-Xf2)
ACSX = ATN (SQR(1-Xf2)/X)
For those of you who are used to working in degrees, here are some
handy user defined functions:
DEFFNS(V) = SIN(V/(18O/tf))
DEFFNC(V) = COS(V/(180/rf))
DEFFNT(V) = TAN(V/(18O/rf))
These are three user defined functions which when called with
arguments and degrees will give the appropriate results. In these
examples V can be any variable but if all three are defined in
the same programme, you must use three different dummy variables.
EXAMPLE: PRINT FNS(3O)
Result of this will be .5. Notice that the argument for FNS, or
FN anything for that matter, can be either a variable or numeric
constant. Also, after a programme containing these definitions
has been run, these functions may be called using FN in the direct
mode, that is, from the keyboard directly without being in a
programme."
"In the context of the C64, What is the price and availability of the second cassette unit for the PET computer?","SECOND CASSETTE UNIT

"In the context of the C64, How can you use a bell built into your computer to alert you when a long disk operation is finished?","Disk De-Activity Indicator
If you're disk unit gets into some long operation, like the one mentioned above, you might not notice that it's finished until the next time you browse by. If you have a bell built into your computer, here is one way to make it useful:
print ds$ : poke 231, 100 : print '|
The POKE increases the chime time of the bell, and the 3 reverse G's invoke it 3 times. If you're within ear-shot, this should be enough to get your attention. Or you can put the bell in an endless loop that stops when you hit a key. Only one problem with this though - if you happen to step out or something, that insidious chiming is enough to drive some one bonkers if left exposed to it for too long. You might come home to find your new hard disk is now a chopping block in the kitchen!"
"In the context of the C64, How does the processor handle interrupts, including break or software interrupts, and what are the implications for user-modified code and I/O chip setup?","INTERRUPT STRUCTURE
Interrupts (including Break or Software Interrupts) are handled
by software polling.
When the processor recognizes an interrupt it vectors through
FFFE, FFFF in ROM to a routine that first inspects the processor
hardware (IRQ line low).
If it was caused by a Break instruction, a Jump Indirect is
executed through locations 02IB, C. If by a hardware interrupt then
a Jump Indirect is taken through locations 0219, A.
These locations being in RAM may be user-modified to point to
extra user code ahead of normal interrupt processing.
Note, however that the IRQ pointer is used by the cassette
routines and should be restored to standard values before the cassette
Save or Load functions are called.
Various sections of the I/O chips can be set up to cause inter
rupts through the IRQ line.
Example: POKE 59470,2 enables a negative edge on the
user port CAL line to cause an interrupt.
However, have your code set up to handle it when it happens!
Also note that each pass through the regular interrupt code
increments the time register."
"In the context of the C64, What are some advanced Commodore 64 hardware tips and modifications for service technicians and enthusiasts?","Some More C64 Hardware Tips
Tony Lamartina of Chicago has another, but it's more suited to service technicians or those with access to necessary equipment.
1. Remove metal cover from video RF area.
2. Connect scope lead between ground and pin 1 of IC31. 3. Adjust R27 for 1.5 volt DC level.
4. Connect scope lead between ground and pin 4 of DIN
plug.
5. Adjust R25 for midposition
6. Connect decade box between pin 4 of DIN plug and
right side of C78
7. Adjust resistance of decade box for 0.8 to 1 volt of
signal level on scope
8. Connect resistor of value determined by decade box
across pin 1 and pin 4 of DIN plug
9. Fine adjust R25 for best display of colour monitor.
Tony also suggests the following be checked on early re leases of the 64:
1. Loose RF box covers. Tighten the metal tabs and re-in stall.
2. Check for a missing heat sink on VR2-7805 voltage regulator. Install suitable heat sink.
3. If the unit displays 'sparkling' (interference across the CRT screen, random in nature) connect a 330 picoF capacitor from pin 20 (ground) to pin 30 (address 6) of the 6567 (VIC II) video chip. Make this connection outside the RF shielded box."
"In the context of the C64, What is the trick to merge two lines of BASIC code into one line on a Commodore PET/CBM or 80-column machine, and how can it be achieved using a POKE command?","Text In Drag
Back when there was only 40 Column PET/CBMs, The Transactor discussed a method of attaching the code from one line of BASIC onto the end of the line above it. For example, the following two lines need not be on two sepa rate lines:
100 for j = 1 to 10 110 next
The two lines would be LISTed on the screen. Then using the space bar to wrap around the top line onto the bottom line, the two lines would become one double line. Naturally it only worked for a range of 80 characters. The top line had to be less than 40 characters long and only the first 40 characters of the line below could be transfered. With the two screen lines linked together, the DELete key would beused to 'drag' the line below up onto the line above, squeezing out the line number plus those extra spaces in the process. Of course you'd have to insert a colon yourself and also delete line 110. Try it! (By the way, this doesn't work on the VIC 20/C64 - the screen editor has been changed and is now too smart for this trick to be pulled off)
When 80 Column machines came along there was no longer any need for a line wrap table in low RAM - all the lines were identical regardless of how much code was entered. So the situation above could still occur, but to add one line to another required re-typing.
(You must know what I'm leading up to. Yes, a POKE this time) By making the operating system 'think' that each line is longer than 80 characters, this same trick can be played on the 80 column screen editor. Slight of hand? No. More accurately, 'right of hand'. Location 213 is the right hand window margin. Normally it contains 79 for 80 column lines (0-79):
poke 213,159
. . .will make the editor think that each screen line is 160 characters long, however, you're still limited to 80 charac ters per program line.
Now, about the only way I could make this work was to start from the beginning of the first line and ' cursor right' all the way over to about column 75. Only then would DELete cooperate and drag the bottom line up. Using cursor left to 'go around the other way' created some other problems.
Once you're done you'll want to restore 213 to a 79. Otherwise you'll get some strangeness occurring. Try POKE 213, 255 and cursor down off the bottom of the screen. Weird, eh? Again, I don't know why. And if you think that's weird, try listing a program that will cause screen scrolling. You won't crash the machine, but you may have to clear the screen before entering any new direct commands. Try experimenting. I'm not sure, but it might even work for 3 screen lines (ie. POKE 213, 239)."

"In the context of the C64, What are the steps to connect a Commodore 1702 monitor to a personal computer?","CONNECTING THE 1702 MONITOR TO A COMPUTER
The monitor connection cable connects your monitor to a Commodore
personal computer.  Before you connect the cable, turn off the power
to both your personal computer and the monitor.

There are two different cables that you can use to connect the monitor
to your computer.

1. One kind of cable has three jacks that connect to the BACK of the
monitor.

2. The other cable has two jacks that connect to the FRONT of the
monitor.

The kind of cable you'll use depends on your computer.  To find out
which kind of cable you should use, look at the audio/video connector
on your computer (see your computer's user manual if you don't know
where this connector is).

1. If the audio/video connector has EIGHT little holes, use the
three-jack cable.

2. If the connector has FIVE little holes, use the two-jack cable.

To connect a three-jack cable to the rear panel of the monitor, follow
these instructions, which clarify the diagram:

1. Plug the eight PIN DIN connector (the larger end of the cable) into
the audio/video connector port on your computer.  Just push the cable
end in.

2. Plug the RCA pin plugs (the jacks) of the cable into the rear
terminals on the monitor.  The jacks and the terminals are color-
coded:

* the audio output jack (WHITE) plugs into the AUDIO IN terminal
(WHITE) on the monitor
* the luminance output jack (YELLOW) plugs into the LUMA terminal
(YELLOW)
* the chroma output jack (RED) plugs into the CHROMA terminal (RED)
