CONNECTING THE 1702 MONITOR TO A COMPUTER
The monitor connection cable connects your monitor to a Commodore
personal computer.  Before you connect the cable, turn off the power
to both your personal computer and the monitor.

There are two different cables that you can use to connect the monitor
to your computer.

1. One kind of cable has three jacks that connect to the BACK of the
monitor.

2. The other cable has two jacks that connect to the FRONT of the
monitor.

The kind of cable you'll use depends on your computer.  To find out
which kind of cable you should use, look at the audio/video connector
on your computer (see your computer's user manual if you don't know
where this connector is).

1. If the audio/video connector has EIGHT little holes, use the
three-jack cable.

2. If the connector has FIVE little holes, use the two-jack cable.

To connect a three-jack cable to the rear panel of the monitor, follow
these instructions, which clarify the diagram:

1. Plug the eight PIN DIN connector (the larger end of the cable) into
the audio/video connector port on your computer.  Just push the cable
end in.

2. Plug the RCA pin plugs (the jacks) of the cable into the rear
terminals on the monitor.  The jacks and the terminals are color-
coded:

* the audio output jack (WHITE) plugs into the AUDIO IN terminal
(WHITE) on the monitor
* the luminance output jack (YELLOW) plugs into the LUMA terminal
(YELLOW)
* the chroma output jack (RED) plugs into the CHROMA terminal (RED)

3. Switch the SIGNAL SELECTOR to the REAR position.
