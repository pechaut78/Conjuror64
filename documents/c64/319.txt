  ATTACK/DECAY (Register 05)

    Bits 4-7 of this register (ATK0-ATK3) select 1 of 16 ATTACK rates for
  the Voice 1 Envelope Generator. The ATTACK rate determines how rapidly
  the output of Voice 1 rises from zero to peak amplitude when the Envelope
  Generator is Gated. The 16 ATTACK rates are listed in Table 2.
    Bits 0-3 (DCY0-DCY3) select 1 of 16 DECAY rates for the Envelope
  Generator. The DECAY cycle follows the ATTACK cycle and the DECAY rate
  determines how rapidly the output fails from the peak amplitude to the
  selected SUSTAIN level. The 16 DECAY rates are listed in Table 2.

  SUSTAIN/RELEASE (Register 06)

    Bits 4-7 of this register (STN0-STN3) select 1 of 16 SUSTAIN levels for
  the Envelope Generator. The SUSTAIN cycle follows the DECAY cycle and the
  output of Voice 1 will remain at the selected SUSTAIN amplitude as long
  as the Gate bit remains set. The SUSTAIN levels range from zero to peak
  amplitude in 16 linear steps, with a SUSTAIN value of 0 selecting zero
  amplitude and a SUSTAIN value of 15 ($F) selecting the peak amplitude. A
  SUSTAIN value of 8 would cause Voice I to SUSTAIN at an amplitude one-
  half the peak amplitude reached by the ATTACK cycle.
    Bits 0-3 (RLS0-RLS3) select 1 of 16 RELEASE rates for the Envelope
  Generator. The RELEASE cycle follows the SUSTAIN cycle when the Gate bit
  is reset to zero. At this time, the output of Voice 1 will fall from the
  SUSTAIN amplitude to zero amplitude at the selected RELEASE rate. The 16
  RELEASE rates are identical to the DECAY rates.

  | NOTE: The cycling of the Envelope Generator can be altered at any     |
  | point via the Gate bit. The Envelope Generator can be Gated and       |
  | Released without restriction. For example, if the Gate bit is reset   |
  | before the envelope has finished the ATTACK cycle, the RELEASE cycle  |
  | will immediately begin, starting from whatever amplitude had been     |
  | reached. if the envelope is then Gated again (before the RELEASE cycle|
  | has reached zero amplitude), another ATTACK cycle will begin, starting|
  | from whatever amplitude had been reached. This technique can be used  |
  | to generate complex amplitude envelopes via real-time software        |
  | control.                                                              |

  | the amount of time per cycle. For example, given an ATTACK value of 2,|
  | the ATTACK cycle would take 16 ms to rise from zero to peak amplitude.|
  | The DECAY/RELEASE rates refer to the amount of time these cycles would|
  | take to fall from peak amplitude to zero.                             |
 

  VOICE 2

    Registers 07-$0D control Voice 2 and are functionally identical to reg-
  isters 00-06 with these exceptions:

    1) When selected, SYNC synchronizes Oscillator 2 with Oscillator 1.
    2) When selected, RING MOD replaces the Triangle output of Oscillator 2
       with the ring modulated combination of Oscillators 2 and 1.

  VOICE 3

    Registers $0E-$14 control Voice 3 and are functionally identical to
  registers 00-06 with these exceptions:

    1) When selected, SYNC synchronizes Oscillator 3 with Oscillator 2.
    2) When selected, RING MOD replaces the Triangle output of Oscillator 3
       with the ring modulated combination of Oscillators 3 and 2.

    Typical operation of a voice consists of selecting the desired parame-
  ters: frequency, waveform, effects (SYNC, RING MOD) and envelope rates,
  then gating the voice whenever the sound is desired. The sound can be
  sustained for any length of time and terminated by clearing the Gate bit.
  Each voice can be used separately, with independent parameters and
  gating, or in unison to create a single, powerful voice. When used in
  unison, a slight detuning of each oscillator or tuning to musical
  intervals creates a rich, animated sound.
