question,answer
"Does the Commodore 64 have a built-in RS-232 interface?","The Commodore 64 has a built-in RS-232 interface for connection to any RS-232 modem, printer, or other device."
"What is required to connect a device to the Commodore 64?","All you need is a cable and a little bit of programming to connect a device to the Commodore 64."
"What is the voltage range of the Commodore 64's RS-232 interface?","The Commodore 64's RS-232 interface is set-up in the standard RS-232 format, but the voltages are TTL levels (0 to 5V) rather than the normal RS-232 -12 to 12 volt range."
"What is the purpose of the RS-232 interface software?","The RS-232 interface software can be accessed from BASIC or from the KERNAL for machine language programming."
"What are the BASIC commands used for RS-232 communication?","RS-232 on the BASIC level uses the normal BASIC commands: OPEN, CLOSE, CMD, INPUT#, GET#, PRINT#, and the reserved variable ST."
"What is the role of the 6526 CIA #2 device in the RS-232 interface?","The 6526 chip generates NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) requests for RS-232 processing, allowing background RS-232 processing to take place during BASIC and machine language programs."
"What are the built-in hold-offs in the KERNAL, cassette, and serial bus routines?","There are built-in hold-offs in the KERNAL, cassette, and serial bus routines to prevent the disruption of data storage or transmission by the NMIs that are generated by the RS-232 routines."
"Why can't data be received from RS-232 devices during cassette or serial bus activities?","Because these hold-offs are only local (assuming you're careful about your programming) no interference should result."
"What are the two buffers in the Commodore 64 RS-232 interface?","The Commodore 64 RS-232 KERNAL buffers consist of two first-in/first-out (FIFO) buffers, each 256 bytes long, at the top of memory."
"What happens when an RS-232 channel is opened?","The OPENing of an RS-232 channel automatically allocates 512 bytes of memory for the buffers."
"What happens if there is not enough free space beyond the end of your BASIC program?","If there is not enough free space beyond the end of your BASIC program no error message will be printed, and the end of your program will be destroyed."
"What happens when an RS-232 channel is closed?","These buffers are automatically removed by using the CLOSE command."
"What is the importance of being careful when programming RS-232 routines?","SO BE CAREFUL!"
"Is the RS-232 interface software accessible from BASIC?","Yes, the RS-232 interface software can be accessed from BASIC."
"Can the RS-232 interface software be accessed from the KERNAL?","Yes, the RS-232 interface software can be accessed from the KERNAL."
"What is the purpose of the RS-232 interface cartridge?","The RS-232 interface cartridge handles the necessary voltage conversions."
"What is the role of the KERNAL in the RS-232 interface?","The KERNAL byte and bit level handlers run under the control of the 6526 CIA #2 device timers and interrupts."
"What is the purpose of the RS-232 interface software in machine language programming?","The RS-232 interface software can be accessed from the KERNAL for machine language programming."
"What are the commands used for RS-232 communication in machine language programming?","The commands used for RS-232 communication in machine language programming are the same as those used in BASIC."
"What is the purpose of the RS-232 interface in the Commodore 64?","The RS-232 interface allows the Commodore 64 to connect to any RS-232 modem, printer, or other device."
"What is the role of the 6526 CIA #2 device in the RS-232 interface?","The 6526 chip generates NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) requests for RS-232 processing."

"What happens when an RS-232 channel is opened?","The OPENing of an RS-232 channel automatically allocates 512 bytes of memory for the buffers."
"What happens if there is not enough free space beyond the end of your BASIC program?","If there is not enough free space beyond the end of your BASIC program no error message will be printed, and the end of your program will be destroyed."
"What happens when an RS-232 channel is closed?","These buffers are automatically removed by using the CLOSE command."
