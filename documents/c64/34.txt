 SPRITE  MULTI-COLOR MODE

    Multi-color mode allows you to have up to 4 different colors in each
  sprite. However, just like other multi-color modes, horizontal resolution
  is cut in half. In other words, when you're working with sprite multi-
  color mode (like in multi-color character mode), instead of 24 dots
  across the sprite, there are 12 pairs of dots. Each pair of dots is
  called a BIT PAIR. Think of each bit pair (pair of dots) as a single dot
  in your overall sprite when it comes to choosing colors for the dots in
  your sprites. The table below gives you the bit pair values needed to
  turn ON each of the four colors you've chosen for your sprite:

    BIT PAIR                           DESCRIPTION
      00        TRANSPARENT, SCREEN COLOR
      01        SPRITE MULTI-COLOR REGISTER #0 (53285) ($D025)
      10        SPRITE COLOR REGISTER
      11        SPRITE MULTI-COLOR REGISTER #I (53286) ($D026)
 
  NOTE: The sprite foreground color is a 10. The character foreground   
   is a 11.
