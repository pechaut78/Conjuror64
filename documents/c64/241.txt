  NONZERO-PAGE MEMORY LOCATIONS AND USAGE FOR
  RS-232 SYSTEM INTERFACE


    General RS-232 storage:

    $0293-M51CTR-Pseudo 6551 control register (see Figure 6-1).
    $0294-M51COR-Pseudo 6551 command register (see Figure 6-2) .
    $0295-M51AJB-Two bytes following the control and command registers in
          the file name field. These locations contain the baud rate for
          the start of the bit test during the interface activity, which,
          in turn, is used to calculate baud rate.
    $0297-RSSTAT-The RS-232 status register (see Figure 6-3).
    $0298-BITNUM-The number of bits to be sent/received.
    $0299-BAUDOF-Two bytes that are equal to the time of one bit cell.
          (Based on system clock/baud rate.)
    $029B-RIDBE-The byte index to the end of the receiver FIFO buffer.
    $029C-RIDBS-The byte index to the start of the receiver FIFO buffer.
    $029D-RODBS-The byte index to the start of the transmitter FIFO buffer.
    $029E-RODBE-The byte index to the end of the transmitter FIFO buffer.
    $02A1-ENABL-Holds current active interrupts in the CIA #2 ICR.
          When bit 4 is turned on means that the system is waiting for the
          Receiver Edge. When bit 1 is turned on then the system is
          receiving data. When bit 0 is turned on then the system is
          transmitting data.
