  APPLICATIONS NOTES

    Locating the Output Register at the internal I/O Port in Page Zero
  enhances the powerful Zero Page Addressing instructions of the 6510.
    By assigning the I/O Pins as inputs (using the Data Direction Register)
  the user has the ability to change the contents of address 0001 (the
  Output Register) using peripheral devices. The ability to change these
  contents using peripheral inputs, together with Zero Page Indirect
  Addressing instructions, allows novel and versatile programming tech-
  niques not possible earlier.
