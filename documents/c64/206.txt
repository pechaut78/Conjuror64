  B-30. Function Name: SETNAM

    Purpose: Set file name
    Call address: $FFBD (hex) 65469 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines:
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected:

    Description: This routine is used to set up the file name for the OPEN,
  SAVE, or LOAD routines. The accumulator must be loaded with the length of
  the file name. The X and Y registers must be loaded with the address of
  the file name, in standard 6502 low-byte/high-byte format. The address
  can be any valid memory address in the system where a string of
  characters for the file name is stored. If no file name is desired, the
  accumulator must be set to 0, representing a zero file length. The X and
  Y registers can be set to any memory address in that case.

  How to Use:

    1) Load the accumulator with the length of the file name.
    2) Load the X index register with the low order address of the file
       name.
    3) Load the Y index register with the high order address.
    4) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    LDA #NAME2-NAME     ;LOAD LENGTH OF FILE NAME
    LDX #<NAME          ;LOAD ADDRESS OF FILE NAME
    LDY #>NAME
    JSR SETNAM
