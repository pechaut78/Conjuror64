question,answer
"Two types of sprite collision are detected.","What are the two types of sprite collision?"
"Sprite to sprite collision and sprite to display data collision.","What is the purpose of the sprite-sprite COLLISION register?"
"To detect sprite to sprite collisions.","What is the purpose of the sprite-DATA COLLISION register?"
"To detect sprite to display data collisions.","What happens when a collision occurs between two sprites?"
"The sprite bits (MnM) in the sprite-sprite COLLISION register are set to '1' for both colliding sprites.","What happens when a collision occurs between a sprite and foreground display data?"
"The sprite-DATA COLLISION register has a 'bit (MnD) for each sprite which is set to '1' when both the sprite and non-background display data are coincident.","Can transparent data generate a collision?"
"No, coincidence of transparent data will not generate a collision.","Can a sprite-DATA collision occur off-screen?"
"Yes, a sprite-DATA collision can occur off-screen in the horizontal direction if actual display data has been scrolled to an off-screen position.","What happens when the first bit of either register is set to '1'?"
"The collision interrupt latches are set.","Do subsequent collisions set the interrupt latch?"
"No, subsequent collisions will not set the interrupt latch until that collision register has been cleared to all '0s' by a read.","What happens when a collision register is read?"
"The collision bits are automatically cleared.","Can a sprite collision occur off-screen?"
"Yes, sprites collisions are detected even if positioned off-screen.","What is the purpose of the scrolling feature?"
"To allow sprite collisions to be detected even if positioned off-screen.","Can the 0-1 multicolor bit pair be used as background display data?"
"Yes, the 0-1 multicolor bit pair can be used as background display data without interfering with true sprite collisions.","What is the purpose of the scrolling feature in sprite collisions?"
"To allow sprite collisions to be detected even if positioned off-screen.","Can a sprite-DATA collision occur off-screen?"
"Yes, a sprite-DATA collision can occur off-screen in the horizontal direction if actual display data has been scrolled to an off-screen position.","What happens when a collision register is read?"
"The collision bits are automatically cleared.","Can a sprite collision occur off-screen in the vertical direction?"
"No, sprite collisions are detected even if positioned off-screen, but not in the vertical direction.","What is the purpose of the sprite-sprite COLLISION register?"
"To detect sprite to sprite collisions.","What is the purpose of the sprite-DATA COLLISION register?"
"To detect sprite to display data collisions.","Can a sprite collision occur off-screen in the vertical direction?"
"No, sprite collisions are detected even if positioned off-screen, but not in the vertical direction."
