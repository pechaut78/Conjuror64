question,answer
"Is the Commodore 64 a 16-bit computer?","No, it has a 16-bit address bus but can address more than 64K bytes of memory."
"What is the total amount of RAM in the Commodore 64?","64K bytes"
"What is the purpose of the 6510 processor chip?","It controls whether RAM or ROM or I/O will appear in certain portions of the system's memory."
"What is the input/output port used for?","To control whether RAM or ROM or I/O will appear in certain portions of the system's memory."
"What is the data direction register used for?","To control whether a given bit will be an input or an output."
"What is the purpose of the LORAM bit?","To bank the 8K byte BASIC ROM in and out of the microprocessor address space."
"What is the purpose of the HIRAM bit?","To bank the 8K byte KERNAL ROM in and out of the microprocessor address space."
"What is the purpose of the CHAREN bit?","To bank the 4K byte character generator ROM in or out of the microprocessor address space."
"What happens when the LORAM bit is programmed LOW?","The BASIC ROM will disappear from the memory map and be replaced by 8K bytes of RAM."
"What happens when the HIRAM bit is programmed LOW?","The KERNAL ROM will disappear from the memory map and be replaced by 8K bytes of RAM."
"What happens when the CHAREN bit is set to 1?","The I/O devices appear in the microprocessor address space, and the character ROM is not accessible."
"What happens when the CHAREN bit is cleared to 0?","The character ROM appears in the processor address space, and the I/O devices are not accessible."
"What is the purpose of the WRITE operation in ROM?","To store data in the RAM 'under' the ROM."
"What happens when a WRITE operation is performed on a ROM location?","Data is stored in the RAM 'under' the ROM."
"What is the purpose of the READ operation in ROM?","To return the contents of the ROM."
"What happens when a READ operation is performed on a ROM location?","The contents of the ROM are returned, not the 'hidden' RAM."
"What is the total amount of ROM in the Commodore 64?","20K bytes"
"What is the purpose of the 20K bytes of ROM?","To contain BASIC, the operating system, and the standard character set."
"What is the purpose of the 4K chunk of memory?","To access input/output devices"
"What is the secret to addressing more than 64K bytes of memory?","The 6510 processor chip itself"
"What is the purpose of the input/output port?","To control whether RAM or ROM or I/O will appear in certain portions of the system's memory"
