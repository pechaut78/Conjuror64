    The INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER is located at 53274 ($D01A). It has the
  same format as the interrupt status register. Unless the corresponding
  bit in the interrupt enable register is set to a 1, no interrupt from
  that source will take place. The interrupt status register can still be
  polled for information, but no interrupts will be generated.
    To enable an interrupt request the corresponding interrupt enable bit
  (as shown in the chart above) must be set to a 1.
    This powerful interrupt structure lets you use split screen modes. For
  instance you can have half of the screen bit mapped, half text, more than
  8 sprites at a time, etc. The secret is to use interrupts properly. For
  example, if you want the top half of the screen to be bit mapped and the
  bottom to be text, just set the raster compare register (as explained
  previously) for halfway down the screen. When the interrupt occurs, tell
  the VIC-II chip to get characters from ROM, then set the raster compare
  register to interrupt at the top of the screen. When the interrupt occurs
  at the top of the screen, tell the VIC-II chip to get characters from RAM
  (bit map mode).
    You can also display more than 8 sprites in the same way. Unfortunately
  BASIC isn't fast enough to do this very well. So if you want to start
  using display interrupts, you should work in machine language.
