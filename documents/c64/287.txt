  STANDARD BIT MAP MODE (BMM =1, MCM = 0)

    When standard bit map mode is in use, the color information is derived
  only from the data stored in the video matrix (the color nybble is
  disregarded). The 8 bits are divided into two 4-bit nybbles which allow
  two colors to be independently selected in each 8*8 dot block. When a bit
  in the display memory is a "0" the color of the output dot is set by the
  least significant (lower) nybble (LSN). Similarly, a display memory bit
  of "1" selects the output color determined by the MSN (upper nybble).

      BIT    |            DISPLAY COLOR
       0     |   Lower nybble of video matrix pointer
       1     |   Upper nybble of video matrix pointer
