  SENDING DATA TO AN RS-232 CHANNEL

    When sending data, the output buffer can hold 255 characters before a
  full buffer hold-off occurs. The system will wait in the CHROUT routine
  until transmission is allowed or the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys are
  used to recover the system through a WARM START.


  BASIC SYNTAX:

    CMD lfn-acts same as in the BASIC specifications.
    PRINT#lfn,<variable list>


  KERNAL ENTRIES:

    CHKOUT ($FFC9)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.
    CHROUT ($FFD2)-See Memory Map for more information on entry conditions.
 
 
  | IMPORTANT NOTES: There is no carriage-return delay built into the     |
  | output channel. This means that a normal RS-232 printer cannot        |
  | correctly print, unless some form of hold-off (asking the Commodore 64|
  | to wait) or internal buffering is implemented by the printer. The     |
  | hold-off can easily be implemented in your program. If a CTS (x-line) |
  | handshake is implemented, the Commodore 64 buffer will fill, and then |
  | hold-off more output until transmission is allowed by the RS-232      |
  | device. X-line handshaking is a handshake routine that uses multi-    |
  | lines for receiving and transmitting data.                            |
  |   The routine CHKOUT handles the x-line handshake, which follows the  |
  | EIA standard (August 1979) for RS-232-C interfaces. The RTS, CTS, and |
  | DCD lines are implemented with the Commodore 64 defined as the Data   |
  | Terminal Device.                                                      |
