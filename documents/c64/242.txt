  THE USER PORT

    The user port is meant to connect the Commodore 64 to the outside
  world. By using the lines available at this port, you can connect the
  Commodore 64 to a printer, a Votrax Type and Talk, a MODEM, even another
  computer.
    The port on the Commodore 64 is directly connected to one of the 6526
  CIA chips. By programming, the CIA will connect to many other devices.

  |     A     |    GND    |  The Commodore 64 gives you control over      |
  |     B     |   FLAG2   |  PORT B on CIA chip #1. Eight lines for input |
  |     C     |    PB0    |  or output are available, as well as 2 lines  |
  |     D     |    PB1    |  for handshaking with an outside device. The  |
  |     E     |    PB2    |  I/O lines for PORT B are controlled by two   |
  |     F     |    PB3    |  locations. One is the PORT itself, and is    |
  |     H     |    PB4    |  located at 56577 ($DD01 HEX). Naturally you  |
  |     I     |    PB5    |  PEEK it to read an INPUT, or POKE it to set  |
  |     K     |    PB6    |  an OUTPUT. Each of the eight I/O lines can   |
  |     L     |    PB7    |  be set up as either an INPUT or an OUTPUT by |
  |     M     |    PA2    |  by setting the DATA DIRECTION REGISTER       |
  |     N     |    GND    |  properly.                                    |
  +-----------+-----------+-----------------------------------------------+


    The DATA DIRECTION REGISTER has its location at 56579 ($DD03 hex). Each
  of the eight lines in the PORT has a BIT in the eight-bit DATA DIRECTION
  REGISTER (DDR) which controls whether that line will be an input or an
  output. If a bit in the DDR is a ONE, the corresponding line of the PORT
  will be an OUTPUT. If a bit in the DDR is a ZERO, the corresponding line
  of the PORT will be an INPUT. For example, if bit 3 of the DDR is set to
  1, then line 3 of the PORT will be an output. A further example:
    If the DDR is set like this:

                          BIT #: 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
                          VALUE: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0

  You can see that lines 5,4, and 3 will be outputs since those bits are
  ones. The rest of the lines will be inputs, since those lines are zeros.
    To PEEK or POKE the USER port, it is necessary to use both the DDR and
  the PORT itself.
    Remember that the PEEK and POKE statements want a number from 0-255.
  The numbers given in the example must be translated into decimal before
  they can be used. The value would be:

                     2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 = 32 + 16 + 8 = 56

  Notice that the bit # for the DDR is the same number that = 2 raised to
  a power to turn the bit value on.

                      (16 = 2^4=2*2*2*2, 8 = 2^3=2*2*2)

    The two other lines, FLAG1 and PA2 are different from the rest of the
  USER PORT. These two lines are mainly for HANDSHAKING, and are programmed
  differently from port B.
    Handshaking is needed when two devices communicate. Since one device
  may run at a different speed than another device it is necessary to give
  the devices some way of knowing what the other device is doing. Even when
  the devices are operating at the same speed, handshaking is necessary to
  let the other know when data is to be sent, and if it has been received.
  The FLAG1 line has special characteristics which make it well suited for
  handshaking.
    FLAG1 is a negative edge sensitive input which can be used as a general
  purpose interrupt input. Any negative transition on the FLAG line will
  set the FLAG interrupt bit. If the FLAG interrupt is enabled, this will

  cause an INTERRUPT REQUEST. If the FLAG bit is not enabled, it can be
  polled from the interrupt register under program control.
    PA2 is bit 2 of PORT A of the CIA. It is controlled like any other bit
  in the port. The port is located at 56576 ($DD00). The data direction
  register is located at 56578 ($DD02.)
