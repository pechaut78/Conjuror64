  SCROLLING

    The display data may be scrolled up to one entire character space in
  both the horizontal and vertical direction. When used in conjunction with
  the smaller display window (above), scrolling can be used to create a
  smooth panning motion of display data while updating the system memory
  only when a new character row (or column) is required. Scrolling is also
  used to center a fixed display within the display window.
