  TURNING ON SPRITES:

    You can turn on any individual sprite by using POKE V+21 and the number
  from the chart... BUT... turning on just ONE sprite will turn OFF any
  others. To turn on TWO OR MORE sprites, ADD TOGETHER the numbers of the
  sprites you want to turn on (Example: POKE V+21, 6 turns on sprites 1 and
  2). Here is a method you can use to turn one sprite off and on without
  affecting any of the others (useful for animation).

  EXAMPLE:

    To turn off just sprite 0 type: POKE V+21,PEEK V+21AND(255-1). Change
  the number 1 in (255-1) to 1,2,4,8,16,32,64, or 128 (for sprites 0-7). To
  re-enable the sprite and not affect the other sprites currently turned
  on, POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21)OR 1 and change the OR 1 to OR 2 (sprite 2), OR
  4 (sprite 3), etc.
