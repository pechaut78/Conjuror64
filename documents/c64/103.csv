question,answer
"what is the purpose of the stack in the 6510 microprocessor","to temporarily remember things and to remember an order of events"
"what is the GOSUB statement used for","to call a subroutine and remember where it is being called from"
"what happens when a GOSUB statement is encountered","the BASIC interpreter pushes its current position onto the stack"
"what happens when a RETURN statement is executed","the interpreter pulls off the stack the information that tells it where it was before the subroutine call was made"
"what are the instructions used to push and pull values onto the stack","PHA and PLA"
"what is the status register used for","to store and retrieve values"
"what is the stack pointer used for","to point to the next available location in the stack"
"what happens when something is pushed onto the stack","it is placed where the stack pointer points to, and the stack pointer is moved down to the next position"
"what happens when something is pulled off the stack","the stack pointer is incremented, and the byte pointed to by the stack pointer is placed into the specified register"
"what is the implied mode in the 6510 microprocessor","a mode where information is implied by an instruction itself"
"what are some examples of implied mode instructions","PHA, PLA, PHP, and PLP"
"what is the X register used for","to store and retrieve values"
"what is the A register used for","to store and retrieve values"

"what is the P register used for","to store and retrieve values"
"what is the purpose of the stack in the 6510 microprocessor","to temporarily remember things and to remember an order of events"
"what is the size of the stack in the 6510 microprocessor","256 bytes"
"where is the stack located in memory","in page one of memory"
"what is the range of the stack in memory","from $01 00 to $01 FF"
"what is the organization of the stack in memory","organized backwards in memory"
"what is the stack pointer used for","to point to the next available location in the stack"
"what happens when the stack pointer is incremented","the byte pointed to by the stack pointer is placed into the specified register"
"what happens when the stack pointer is decremented","the stack pointer is moved down to the next position"
"what is the purpose of the PHP instruction","to push the status register onto the stack"
"what is the purpose of the PLP instruction","to pull the status register off the stack"
"what is the purpose of the PHA instruction","to push the accumulator onto the stack"
"what is the purpose of the PLA instruction","to pull the accumulator off the stack"
"what is the purpose of the GOSUB statement","to call a subroutine and remember where it is being called from"
"what is the purpose of the RETURN statement","to return from a subroutine and remember where it was before the subroutine call was made"
