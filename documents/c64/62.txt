 DISPLAYING A SPRITE BEYOND THE 255TH X-POSITION

    Displaying a sprite beyond the 255th X position requires a special POKE
  which SETS the most significant bit of the X position and starts over at
  the 256th pixel position across the screen. Here's how it works...
    First, you POKE V+16 with the number for the sprite you're using (check
  the "RIGHT X" row in the X-Y chart... we'll use sprite 0). Now we assign
  an X position, keeping in mind that the X counter starts over from 0 at
  the 256th position on the screen. Change line 50 to read as follows:
    50 POKE V+16,1:POKE V,24:POKE V+1,75

  This line POKEs V+ 16 with the number required to "open up" the right
  side of the screen... the new X position 24 for sprite 0 now begins 24
  pixels to the RIGHT of position 255. To check the right edge of the
  screen, change line 60 to:

    60 POKE V+16,1:POKE V,65:POKE V+1,75

    Some experimentation with the settings in the sprite chart will give
  you the settings you need to position and move sprites on the left and
  right sides of the screen. The section on "moving sprites" will also
  increase your understanding of how sprite positioning works.
