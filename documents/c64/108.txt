  SUBROUTINES

    In machine language (in the same way as using BASIC), you can call
  subroutines. The instruction to call a subroutine is JSR (Jump to Sub-
  Routine), followed by the specified absolute address.
    Incorporated in the operating system, there is a machine language
  subroutine that will PRINT a character to the screen. The CBM ASCII code
  of the character should be in the accumulator before calling the
  subroutine. The address of this subroutine is $FFD2.
    Therefore, to print "Hi" to the screen, the following program should be
  entered:

    .A 1400 LDA #$48     - load the CBM ASCII code of "H"
    .A 1402 JSR $FFD2    -  print it
    .A 1405 LDA #$49     - load the CBM ASCII code of "I"
    .A 1407 JSR $FFD2    -  print that too
    .A 140A LDA #$0D     - print a carriage return as well
    .A 140C JSR $FFD2
    .A 140F BRK          - return to 64MON
    .G 1400              - will print "HI" and return to 64MON
