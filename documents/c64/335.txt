  EXT IN (Pin 26)

    This analog input allows external audio signals to be mixed with the
  audio output of SID or processed through the Filter. Typical sources in-
  clude voice, guitar, and organ. The input impedance of this pin is on the
  order of 100 kohms. Any signal applied directly to the pin should ride at
  a DC level of 6 volts and should not exceed 3 volts p-p. In order to pre-

  vent any interference caused by DC level differences, external signals
  should be AC-coupled to EXT IN by an electrolytic capacitor in the 1-10
  uF range. As the direct audio path (FILTEX=0) has unity gain, EXT IN can
  be used to mix outputs of many SID chips by daisy-chaining. The number of
  chips that can be chained in this manner is determined by the amount of
  noise and distortion allowable at the final output. Note that the output
  Volume control will affect not only the three SID voices, but also any
  external inputs.
