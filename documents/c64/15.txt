  MULTI-COLOR MODE GRAPHICS

    Standard high-resolution graphics give you control of very small dots
  on the screen. Each dot in character memory can have 2 possible values,
  1 for on and 0 for off. When a dot is off, the color of the screen is
  used in the space reserved for that dot. If the dot is on, the dot is
  colored with the character color you have chosen for that screen posi-
  tion. When you're using standard high-resolution graphics, all the dots
  within each 8X8 character can either have background color or foreground
  color. In some ways this limits the color resolution within that space.
  For example, problems may occur when two different colored lines cross.
    Multi-color mode gives you a solution to this problem. Each dot in
  multi-color mode can be one of 4 colors: screen color (background color
  register #0), the color in background register #1, the color in back-
  ground color register #2, or character color. The only sacrifice is in
  the horizontal resolution, because each multi-color mode dot is twice as
  wide as a high-resolution dot. This minimal loss of resolution is more
  than compensated for by the extra abilities of multi-color mode.
