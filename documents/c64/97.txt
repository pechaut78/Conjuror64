  THE INPUT/OUTPUT PORT

    This register appears at memory locations 0 (for the DATA DIRECTION
  REGISTER) and 1 (for the actual PORT). It is an 8-bit input/output port.
  On the Commodore 64 this register is used for memory management, to
  allow the chip to control more than 64K of RAM and ROM memory.
    The details of these registers are not given here. They are explained
  as the principles needed to explain them are explained.
