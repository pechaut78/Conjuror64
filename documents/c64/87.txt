    The C64 OPERATING SYSTEM is in charge of "organizing" all the memory in
  your machine for various tasks. It also looks at what characters you type
  on the keyboard and puts them onto the screen, plus a whole number of
  other functions. The OPERATING SYSTEM can be thought of as the
  "intelligence and personality" of the Commodore 64 (or any computer for
  that matter). So when you turn on your Commodore 64, the OPERATING SYSTEM
  takes control of your machine, and after it has done its housework, it
  then says:

    READY.
