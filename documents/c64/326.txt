  SID PIN DESCRIPTION

  CAP1A,CAP1B, (Pins 1,2)/ CAP2A,CAP2B (Pins 3,4)

    These pins are used to connect the two integrating capacitors required
  by the programmable Filter. C1 connects between pins 1 and 2, C2 between
  pins 3 and 4. Both capacitors should be the some value. Normal operation
  of the Filter over the audio range (approximately 30 Hz-12 kHz) is
  accomplished with a value of 2200 pF for C1 and C2. Polystyrene
  capacitors are preferred and in complex polyphonic systems, where many
  SID chips must track each other, matched capacitors are recommended.
    The frequency range of the Filter can be tailored to specific applica-
  tions by the choice of capacitor values. For example, a low-cost game may
  not require full high-frequency response. In this case, larger values
  for C1 and C2 could be chosen to provide more control over the bass
  frequencies of the Filter. The maximum Cutoff Frequency of the Filter is
  given by:

                             FCmax = 2.6E-5/C

  Where C is the capacitor value. The range of the Filter extends 9 octaves
  below the maximum Cutoff Frequency.
