    The Commodore 64 has two complete character sets that you can use
  either from the keyboard or in your programs.
    In SET 1, the upper case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. If you hold down the <SHIFT> key
  while typing, the graphics characters on the RIGHT side of the front of
  the keys are used. If you hold down the <C=> key while typing, the
  graphics characters on the LEFT side of the front of the key are used.
  Holding down the <SHIFT> key while typing any character that doesn't
  have graphic symbols on the front of the key gives you the symbol on the
  top most part of the key.
    In SET 2, the lower case alphabet and the numbers 0-9 are available
  without pressing the <SHIFT> key. The upper case alphabet is available
  when you hold down the <SHIFT> key while typing. Again, the graphic
  symbols on the LEFT side of the front of the keys are displayed by press-
  ing the <C=> key, while the symbols on the top most part of any key
  without graphics characters are selected when you hold down the <SHIFT>
  key while typing.
    To switch from one character set to the other press the <C=> and
  the <SHIFT> keys together.
