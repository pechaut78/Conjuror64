 MAGNIFICATION

    Each sprite can be selectively expanded (2X) in both the horizontal and
  vertical directions. Two registers contain the control bits (MnXE,MnYE)
  for the magnification control.


    REGISTER  |                        FUNCTION
  ------------+------------------------------------------------------------
     23 ($17) | Horizontal expand MnXE-"1"=expand; "0"=normal
     29 ($1D) | Vertical expand MnYE-"1"=expand; "0"=normal

  When sprites are expanded, no increase in resolution is realized. The same
  24*21 array (12X21 if multi-colored) is displayed, but the overall sprite
  dimension is doubled in the desired direction (the smallest sprite dot may
  be up to 4X standard dot dimension if a sprite is both multi-colored and
  expanded).
