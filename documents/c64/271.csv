question,answer
"what is the purpose of the 02 clock input","The 02 clock is a TTL compatible input used for internal device operation and as a timing reference for communicating with the system data bus."
"what is the function of the /CS-Chip Select Input","The /CS input controls the activity of the 6526. A low level on /CS while 02 is high causes the device to respond to signals on the R/W and address (RS) lines."
"what is the purpose of the R/W-Read/Write Input","The R/W signal is normally supplied by the microprocessor and controls the direction of data transfers of the 6526."
"what are the functions of the RS3-RS0-Address Inputs","The address inputs select the internal registers as described by the Register Map."
"what is the purpose of the DB7-DB0-Data Bus Inputs/Outputs","The eight data bus pins transfer information between the 6526 and the system data bus."
"what is the purpose of the IRQ-Interrupt Request Output","IRQ is an open drain output normally connected to the processor interrupt input."
"what is the purpose of the /RES-Reset Input","A low on the RES pin resets all internal registers."
"what is the purpose of the 6526 interface signals","The 6526 interface signals are used for internal device operation and as a timing reference for communicating with the system data bus."
"what is the function of the /CS-Chip Select Input in the 6526 interface signals","The /CS input controls the activity of the 6526."
"what is the purpose of the R/W-Read/Write Input in the 6526 interface signals","The R/W signal is normally supplied by the microprocessor and controls the direction of data transfers of the 6526."
