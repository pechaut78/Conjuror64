  INTERRUPT STATUS REGISTER

    The interrupt status register shows the current status of any interrupt
  source. The current status of bit 2 of the interrupt register will be a 1
  when two sprites hit each other. The same is true, in a corresponding 1
  to 1 relationship, for bits 0-3 listed in the chart below. Bit 7 is also
  set with a 1, whenever an interrupt occurs.
    The interrupt status register is located at 53273 ($D019) and is as
  follows:

    LATCH  BIT#             DESCRIPTION

    IRST    0   Set when current raster count = stored raster count
    IMDC    1   Set by SPRITE-DATA collision (1st one only, until reset)
    IMMC    2   Set by SPRITE-SPRITE collision (1st one only, until reset)
     ILP    3   Set by negative transition of light pen (1 per frame)
     IRQ    7   Set by latch set and enabled
 
    Once an interrupt bit has been set, it's "latched" in and must be
  cleared by writing a 1 to that bit in the interrupt register when you're
  ready to handle it. This allows selective interrupt handling, without
  having to store the other interrupt bits.
