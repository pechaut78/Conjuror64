  02 (Pin 6)

    This TTL-Level input is the master clock for SID. All oscillator
  frequencies and envelope rates are referenced to this clock. 02 also
  controls data transfers between SID and the microprocessor. Data can only
  be transferred when (02 is high. Essentially, (02 acts as a high-active
  chip select as far as data transfers are concerned. This pin is normally
  connected to the system clock, with a nominal operating frequency of 1.0
  MHz.
