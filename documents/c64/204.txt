  B-28. Function Name: SETLFS

    Purpose: Set up a logical file
    Call address: $FFBA (hex) 65466 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: None


    Description: This routine sets the logical file number, device address,
  and secondary address (command number) for other KERNAL routines.
    The logical file number is used by the system as a key to the file
  table created by the OPEN file routine. Device addresses can range from 0
  to 31. The following codes are used by the Commodore 64 to stand for the
  CBM devices listed below:


                  ADDRESS          DEVICE

                     0            Keyboard
                     1            Datassette(TM)
                     2            RS-232C device
                     3            CRT display
                     4            Serial bus printer
                     8            CBM serial bus disk drive


    Device numbers 4 or greater automatically refer to devices on the
  serial bus.
    A command to the device is sent as a secondary address on the serial
  bus after the device number is sent during the serial attention
  handshaking sequence. If no secondary address is to be sent, the Y index
  register should be set to 255.

  How to Use:

    1) Load the accumulator with the logical file number.
    2) Load the X index register with the device number.
    3) Load the Y index register with the command.


  EXAMPLE:

    FOR LOGICAL FILE 32, DEVICE #4, AND NO COMMAND:
    LDA #32
    LDX #4
    LDY #255
