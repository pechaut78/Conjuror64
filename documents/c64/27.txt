    These special sprite abilities make it simple to program many arcade
  style games. Because the sprites are maintained by hardware, it is even
  possible to write a good quality game in BASIC!
    There are 8 sprites supported directly by the VIC-II chip. They are
  numbered from 0 to 7. Each of the sprites has it own definition location,
  position registers and color register, and has its own bits for enable
  and collision detection.
