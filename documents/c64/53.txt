  RASTER REGISTER

    The raster register is found in the VIC-II chip at location 53266
  ($D012). The raster register is a dual purpose register. When you read
  this register it returns the lower 8 bits of the current raster position.
  The raster position of the most significant bit is in register location
  53265 ($D011). You use the raster register to set up timing changes in
  your display so that you can get rid of screen flicker. The changes on
  your screen should be mode when the raster is not in the visible display
  area, which is when your dot positions fall between 51 and 251.
    When the raster register is written to (including the MSB) the number
  written to is saved for use with the raster compare function. When the
  actual raster value becomes the same as the number written to the raster
  register, a bit in the VIC-II chip interrupt register 53273 ($D019) is
  turned ON by setting it to 1.

   NOTE: If the proper interrupt bit is enabled (turned on), an interrupt
   (IRQ) will occur.
