  sprite MEMORY ACCESS

    The data for each sprite is Stored in 63 consecutive bytes of memory. Each
  block of sprite data is defined by a sprite pointer, located at the end of the
  VIDEO MATRIX. Only 1000 bytes of the video matrix are used in the normal
  display modes, allowing the video matrix locations 1016-1023 (VM base+
  $3F8 to VM base+$3FF) to be used for sprite pointers 0-7, respectively. The
  eight-bit sprite pointer from the video matrix together with the six bits
  from the sprite byte counter (to address 63 bytes) define the entire 14-bit
  address field:


     A13| A12| A11| A10| A09| A08| A07| A06| A05| A04| A03| A02| A01| A00
  ------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+------
     MP7| MP6| MP5| MP4| MP3| MP2| MP1| MP0| MC5| MC4| MC3| MC2| MC1| MC0

  Where MPx are the sprite pointer bits from the video matrix and MCx are the
  internally generated sprite counter bits. The sprite pointers are read from the
  video matrix at the end of every raster line. When the Y position
  register of a sprite matches the current raster line count, the actual
  fetches of sprite data begin. Internal counters automatically step through
  the 63 bytes of sprite data, displaying three bytes on each raster line.
