  COLLISION DETECTS

    One of the more interesting aspects of the VIC-II chip is its collision
  detection abilities. Collisions can be detected between sprites, or be-
  tween sprites and background data. A collision occurs when a non-zero
  part of a sprite overlaps a non-zero portion of another sprite or char-
  acters on the screen.
