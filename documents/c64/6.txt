  VIDEO BANK SELECTION
 OR VBLANK

    The VIC-II chip can access ("see") 16K of memory at a time. Since there
  is 64K of memory in the Commodore 64, you want to be able to have the
  VIC-II chip see all of it. There is a way. There are 4 possible BANKS
  (or sections) of 16K of memory. All that is needed is some means of
  controlling which 16K bank the VIC-II chip looks at. In that way, the
  chip can "see" the entire 64K of memory. The BANK SELECT bits that allow
  you access to all the different sections of memory are located in the
  6526 COMPLEX INTERFACE ADAPTER CHIP #2 (CIA #2). The POKE and PEEK BASIC
  statements (or their machine language versions) are used to select a
  bank, by controlling bits 0 and 1 of PORT A of CIA#2 (location 56576 (or
  $DD00 HEX)). These 2 bits must be set to outputs by setting bits 0 and 1
  of location 56578 ($DD02,HEX) to change banks. The following example
  shows this:

    POKE 56578,PEEK(56578)OR 3: REM MAKE SURE BITS 0 AND 1 ARE OUTPUTS
    POKE 56576,(PEEK(56576)AND 252)OR A: REM CHANGE BANKS



  This 16K bank concept is part of everything that the VIC-II chip does.
  You should always be aware of which bank the VIC-II chip is pointing at,
  since this will affect where character data patterns come from, where the
  screen is, where sprites come from, etc. When you turn on the power of
  your Commodore 64, bits 0 and 1 of location 56576 are automatically set
  to BANK 0 ($0000-$3FFF) for all display information.
