  B-16. Function Name: MEMBOT

    Purpose: Set bottom of memory
    Call address: $FF9C (hex) 65436 (decimal)
    Communication registers: X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: X, Y

    Description: This routine is used to set the bottom of the memory. If
  the accumulator carry bit is set when this routine is called, a pointer
  to the lowest byte of RAM is returned in the X and Y registers. On the
  unexpanded Commodore 64 the initial value of this pointer is $0800
  (2048 in decimal). If the accumulator carry bit is clear (-O) when this
  routine is called, the values of the X and Y registers are transferred to
  the low and high bytes, respectively, of the pointer to the beginning of
  RAM.

  How to Use:
  TO READ THE BOTTOM OF RAM
    1) Set the carry.
    2) Call this routine.

  TO SET THE BOTTOM OF MEMORY
    1) Clear the carry.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;MOVE BOTTOM OF MEMORY UP 1 PAGE
    SEC         ;READ MEMORY BOTTOM
    JSR MEMBOT
    INY
    CLC         ;SET MEMORY BOTTOM TO NEW VALUE
    JSR MEMBOT
