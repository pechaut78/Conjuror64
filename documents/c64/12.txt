  CHARACTER DEFINITIONS

    Each character is formed in an 8 by 8 grid of dots, where each dot may
  be either on or off. The Commodore 64 character images are stored in the
  Character Generator ROM chip. The characters are stored as a set of 8
  bytes for each character, with each byte representing the dot pattern of
  a row in the character, and each bit representing a dot. A zero bit means
  that dot is off, and a one bit means the dot is on.
    The character memory in ROM begins at location 53248 (when the I/O
  is switched off). The first 8 bytes from location 53248 ($D000) to 53255
  ($D007) contain the pattern for the @ sign, which has a character code
  value of zero in the screen memory. The next 8 bytes, from location
  53256 ($D008) to 53263 ($D00F), contain the information for forming the
  letter A.

    Each complete character set takes up 2K (2048 bits) of memory, 8 bytes
  per character and 256 characters. Since there are two character sets, one
  for upper case and graphics and the other with upper and lower case, the
  character generator ROM takes up a total of 4K locations.
