  Interrupt Control (ICR)

    There are five sources of interrupts on the 6526: underflow from TIMER
  A, underflow from TIMER B, TOD ALARM, Serial Port full/empty and /FLAG.
  A single register provides masking and interrupt information. The
  interrupt Control Register consists of a write-only MASK register and a
  read-only DATA register. Any interrupt will set the corresponding bit in
  the DATA register. Any interrupt which is enabled by the MASK register
  will set the IR bit (MSB) of the DATA register and bring the /IRQ pin
  low. In a multi-chip system, the IR bit can be polled to detect which
  chip has generated an interrupt request. The interrupt DATA register is
  cleared and the /IRQ line returns high following a read of the DATA
  register. Since each interrupt sets an interrupt bit regardless of the
  MASK, and each interrupt bit can be selectively masked to prevent the
  generation of a processor interrupt, it is possible to intermix polled
  interrupts with true interrupts. However, polling the IR bit will cause
  the DATA register to clear, therefore, it is up to the user to preserve
  the information contained in the DATA register if any polled interrupts
  were present.
    The MASK register provides convenient control of individual mask bits.
  When writing to the MASK register, if bit 7 (SET/CLEAR) of the data
written is a ZERO, any mask bit written with a one will be cleared, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. If bit 7 of the
  data written is a ONE, any mask bit written with a one will be set, while
  those mask bits written with a zero will be unaffected. In order for an
  interrupt flag to set IR and generate an Interrupt Request, the corre-
  sponding MASK bit must be set.
