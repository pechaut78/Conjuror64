  SPRITE POSITIONING

    Once you've made a sprite you want to be able to move it around the
  screen. To do this, your Commodore 64 uses three positioning registers:

    1) SPRITE X POSITION REGISTER
    2) SPRITE Y POSITION REGISTER
    3) MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT X POSITION REGISTER

    Each sprite has an X position register, a Y position register, and a
  bit in the X most significant bit register. This lets you position your
  sprites very accurately. You can place your sprite in 512 possible X
  positions and 256 possible Y positions.
    The X and Y position registers work together, in pairs, as a team. The
  locations of the X and Y registers appear in the memory map as follows:
  First is the X register for sprite 0, then the Y register for sprite 0.
  Next comes the X register for sprite 1, the Y register for sprite 1, and
  so on. After all 16 X and Y registers comes the most significant bit in
  the X position (X MSB) located in its own register.
