  B-31. Function Name: SETTIM

    Purpose: Set the system clock
    Call address: $FFDB (hex) 65499 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: None

    Description: A system clock is maintained by an interrupt routine that
  updates the clock every 1/60th of a second (one "jiffy"). The clock is
  three bytes long, which gives it the capability to count up to 5,184,000
  jiffies (24 hours). At that point the clock resets to zero. Before
  calling this routine to set the clock, the accumulator must contain the
  most significant byte, the X index register the next most significant
  byte, and the Y index register the least significant byte of the initial
  time setting (in jiffies).

  How to Use:
    1) Load the accumulator with the MSB of the 3-byte number to set the
       clock.
    2) Load the X register with the next byte.
    3) Load the Y register with the LSB.
    4) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:
   ;SET THE CLOCK TO 10 MINUTES = 3600 JIFFIES
   LDA #0               ;MOST SIGNIFICANT
   LDX #>3600
   LDY #<3600           ;LEAST SIGNIFICANT
