  6510 MICROPROCESSOR CHIP
  SPECIFICATIONS

  DESCRIPTION

    The 6510 is a low-cost microcomputer system capable of solving a broad
  range of small-systems and peripheral-control problems at minimum cost to
  the user.
    An 8-bit Bi-Directional I/O Port is located on-chip with the Output
  Register at Address 0000 and the Data-Direction Register at Address 0001.
  The I/O Port is bit-by-bit programmable.
    The Three-State sixteen-bit Address Bus allows Direct Memory Accessing
  (DMA) and multiprocessor systems sharing a common memory.
    The internal processor architecture is identical to the MOS Technology
  6502 to provide software compatibility.
