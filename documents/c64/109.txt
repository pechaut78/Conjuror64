    The "PRINT a character" routine we have just used is part of the KERNAL
  jump table. The instruction similar to GOTO in BASIC is JMP, which means
  JUMP to the specified absolute address. The KERNAL is a long list of
  "standardized" subroutines that control ALL input and output of the
  Commodore 64. Each entry in the KERNAL JMPs to a subroutine in the
  operating system. This "jump table" is found between memory locations
  $FF84 to $FFF5 in the operating system. A full explanation of the KERNAL
  is available in the "KERNAL Reference Section" of this manual. However,
  certain routines are used here to show how easy and effective the KERNAL
  is.
    Let's now use the new principles you've just learned in another pro-
  gram. It will help you to put the instructions into context:
This program. will display the alphabet using a KERNAL routine. The
  only new instruction introduced here is TXA Transfer the contents of the
  X index register, into the Accumulator.

    .A 1400 LDX #$41     - X = CBM ASCII of "A"
    .A 1402 TXA          - A = X
    .A 1403 JSR $FFD2    - print character
    .A 1406 INX          - bump count
    .A 1407 CPX #$5B     - have we gone past "Z"?
    .A 1409 BNE $1402    - no, go back and do more
    .A 140B BRK          - yes, return to 64MON

    To see the Commodore 64 print the alphabet, type the familiar command:

    .G 1400

    The comments that are beside the program, explain the program flow and
  logic. If you are writing a program, write it on paper first, and then
  test it in small parts if possible.
