question,answer
"Is CS a low active chip select?","This TTL-Level input is a low active chip select which controls data transfers between SID and the microprocessor."
"What is the condition for a Read from the selected SID register?","A Read from the selected SID register can only occur if CS is low, 02 is high and R/W is high."
"What is the condition for a Write to the selected SID register?","A Write to the selected SID register can only occur if CS is low, (02 is high and R/W is low."
"What is the purpose of the CS pin?","This pin is normally connected to address decoding circuitry, allowing SID to reside in the memory map of a system."
"Is CS pin connected to address decoding circuitry?","This pin is normally connected to address decoding circuitry, allowing SID to reside in the memory map of a system."
"What is the function of the CS pin in data transfers?","This TTL-Level input is a low active chip select which controls data transfers between SID and the microprocessor."
"What is the condition for a transfer between SID and the microprocessor?","CS must be low for any transfer."
