 By using the <C=> key and the COLOR keys the characters can be changed to any color, including multi-color characters. For example, type this command:

 POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16:PRINT'<CTRL+3>';: rem lt.red/ multi-color red

 The word READY and anything else you type will be displayed in multi-color mode. Another color control can set you back to regular text.
