  SPRITE TO DATA COLLISIONS

    Sprite to data collisions are detected in the sprite to data collision
  register at location 53279 ($D01F in HEX) of the VIC-II chip control
  register.
    Each sprite has a bit in this register. If that bit is a 1 , then that
  sprite is involved in a collision. The bits in this register remain set
  until read (PEEKed). Once read, the register is automatically cleared, so
  it is a good idea to save the value in a variable until you are finished
  with it.

   NOTE: MULTI-COLOR data 01 is considered transparent for collisions,   
   even though it shows up on the screen. When setting up a background   
   screen, it is a good idea to make everything that should not cause a  
   collision 01 in multi-color mode.
