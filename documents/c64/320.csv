question,answer
"FC LO and FC HI registers form an 11-bit number which linearly controls the Cutoff Frequency of the programmable Filter.","The approximate Cutoff Frequency ranges from 30 Hz to 12 KHz."
"Resonance is a peaking effect which emphasizes frequency components at the Cutoff Frequency of the Filter.","causing a sharper sound."
"Bits 4-7 of RES/FILT register control the resonance of the filter.","There are 16 resonance settings ranging linearly from no resonance (0) to maximum resonance (15 or $F)."
"Bits 0-3 of RES/FILT register determine which signals will be routed through the Filter.","FILT 1 (Bit 0), FILT 2 (Bit 1), FILT 3 (Bit 2), and FILTEX (Bit 3) control the routing of signals."
"Voice 1 will be processed through the Filter when FILT 1 is set to a one.","the harmonic content of Voice 1 will be altered according to the selected Filter parameters."
"External audio input (pin 26) will be processed through the Filter when FILTEX is set to a one.","the harmonic content of External audio input will be altered according to the selected Filter parameters."
"FC LO and FC HI registers are used to form an 11-bit number.","which linearly controls the Cutoff Frequency of the programmable Filter."
"Resonance settings range from no resonance to maximum resonance.","There are 16 resonance settings ranging linearly from no resonance (0) to maximum resonance (15 or $F)."
