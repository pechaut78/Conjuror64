  COLOR

    Each sprite has a separate 4-bit register to determine the sprite color. The
  two sprite color modes are:

  STANDARD sprite (MnMC = 0)

    In the standard mode, a "0" bit of sprite data allows any background data
  to show through (transparent) and a "1" bit is displayed as the sprite color
  determined by the corresponding sprite Color register.

  MULTI-COLOR sprite (MnMC = 1)

    Each sprite can be individually selected as a multi-color sprite via MnMC
  bits in the sprite Multi-color register 28 ($1C). When the MnMC bit is "1",
  the corresponding sprite is displayed in the multi-color mode. In the multi-
  color mode, the sprite data is interpreted in pairs (similar to the other
  multi-color modes) as follows:

        BIT PAIR      |                   COLOR DISPLAYED
           00         |  Transparent
           01         |  sprite Multi-color #0 (register 37 ($25))
           10         |  sprite Color (registers 39-46 ($27-$2E))
           11         |  sprite Multi-color #1 (register 38 ($26))


  Since two bits of data are required for each color, the resolution of the
  sprite is reduced to 12X21, with each horizontal dot expanded to twice
  standard size so that the overall sprite size does not change. Note that up
  to 3 colors can be displayed in each sprite (in addition to transparent) but
  that two of the colors are shared among all the sprites in the multi-color
  mode.
