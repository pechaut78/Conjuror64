 KERNAL ERROR CODES

    The following is a list of error messages which can occur when using
  the KERNAL routines. If an error occurs during a KERNAL routine , the
  carry bit of the accumulator is set, and the number of the error message
  is returned in the accumulator.

  | NOTE: Some KERNAL I/O routines do not use these codes for error       |
  | messages. Instead, errors are identified using the KERNAL READST      |
  | routine.                                                              |
