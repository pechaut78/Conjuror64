    Description: This routine commands all devices on the serial bus to
  stop receiving data from the Commodore 64 (i.e., UNLISTEN). Calling this
  routine results in an UNLISTEN command being transmitted on the serial
  bus. Only devices previously commanded to listen are affected. This
  routine is normally used after the Commodore 64 is finished sending data
  to external devices. Sending the UNLISTEN commands the listening devices
  to get off the serial bus so it can be used for other purposes.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine.
