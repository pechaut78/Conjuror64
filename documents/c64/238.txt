  CLOSING AN RS-232 DATA CHANNEL

    Closing an RS-232 file discards all data in the buffers at the time of
  execution (whether or not it had been transmitted or printed out), stops
  all RS-232 transmitting and receiving, sets the RTS and transmitted data
  (Sout) lines high, and removes both RS-232 buffers.


  BASIC SYNTAX:

    CLOSE lfn


  KERNAL ENTRY:

    CLOSE ($FFC3)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.

  | NOTE: Care should be taken to ensure all data is transmitted before   |
  | closing the channel. A way to check this from BASIC is:               |
  |                                                                       |
  | 100 SS=ST: IF(SS=0 OR SS=8) THEN 100                                  |
  | 110 CLOSE lfn                                                         |
