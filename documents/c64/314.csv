question,answer
"What are the three synthesizer voices in the 6581?"
"The 6581 consists of three synthesizer voices which can be used independently or in conjunction with each other"
"What is the purpose of the Tone Oscillator in the 6581?"
"The Tone Oscillator controls the pitch of the voice over a wide range"
"What is the function of the Envelope Generator in the 6581?"
"The Envelope Generator creates an amplitude envelope with programmable rates of increasing and decreasing volume"
"What is the purpose of the Amplitude Modulator in the 6581?"
"The Amplitude Modulator controls the volume dynamics of the oscillator under the direction of the Envelope Generator"
"What is the purpose of the Filter in the 6581?"
"The Filter is provided for generating complex, dynamic tone colors via subtractive synthesis"
"What is the purpose of the third Oscillator in the 6581?"
"The third Oscillator can act as a random number generator for games or as a source of modulation information for creating vibrato, frequency/filter sweeps and similar effects"
"What are the two A/D converters used for in the 6581?"
"The two A/D converters are used for interfacing SID with potentiometers, which can be used for 'paddles' in a game environment or as front panel controls in a music synthesizer"
"What is the purpose of SID's ability to process external audio signals?"
"SID can process external audio signals, allowing multiple SID chips to be daisy-chained or mixed in complex polyphonic systems"
"What is the purpose of the SID chip's ability to read the changing output of the third Oscillator and Envelope Generator?"
"These outputs can be used as a source of modulation information for creating vibrato, frequency/filter sweeps and similar effects"
"What is the purpose of the SID chip's ability to act as a random number generator?"
"The third Oscillator can act as a random number generator for games"
"What is the purpose of the SID chip's ability to interface with potentiometers?"
