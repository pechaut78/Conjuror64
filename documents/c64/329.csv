question,answer
"Does the TTL-level input control the direction of data transfers?","This TTL-level input controls the direction of data transfers between SID and the microprocessor."
"What happens when the chip select conditions have been met and the input is high?","a high on this line allows the microprocessor to Read data from the selected SID register"
"What happens when the chip select conditions have been met and the input is low?","a low allows the microprocessor to Write data into the selected SID register"
"What is the purpose of the Read/Write line?","This pin is normally connected to the system Read/Write line."
"Can the microprocessor read data from the SID register?","a high on this line allows the microprocessor to Read data from the selected SID register"
"Can the microprocessor write data into the SID register?","a low allows the microprocessor to Write data into the selected SID register"
