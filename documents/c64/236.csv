"what is the maximum number of characters that the Commodore 64 receiver buffer can hold?","The Commodore 64 receiver buffer will hold up to 255 characters before the buffer overflows."
"what happens if the buffer overflows?","If an overflow occurs, then all characters received during a full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost."
"what is the recommended way to receive RS-232 data at high speeds?","You will have to use machine language routines to handle this type of data burst."
"what is the difference between GET# and INPUT#?","GET# is recommended, while INPUT# is not recommended because it can cause the system to hang in a waiting condition."
"what happens if a GET# does not find any data in the buffer?","The character "" (a null) is returned."
"what is the purpose of the routine CHKIN?","The routine CHKIN handles the x-line handshake which follows the EIA standard for RS-232-C interfaces."
"what is the standard for RS-232-C interfaces?","The standard is defined as the Data Terminal device."
"what happens if the Clear To Send (CTS) or Data Set Ready (DSR) line(s) disappear during character INPUT#?","The system will hang in a RESTORE-only state."
"what is the recommended way to handle data bursts?","You will have to use machine language routines to handle this type of data burst."
"what is the maximum word length for RS-232-C interfaces?","The maximum word length is 8 bits."
"what happens if the word length is less than 8 bits?","All unused bit(s) will be assigned a value of zero."
"what is the purpose of the routine GETIN?","The routine GETIN is used to receive data from an RS-232 channel."
"what is the purpose of the routine CHRIN?","The routine CHRIN is used to receive data from an RS-232 channel."
"what is the recommended way to receive data from an RS-232 channel?","You should use the GET# routine."
"what happens if the buffer is not kept clear?","The buffer will overflow and all characters received during a full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost."
"what is the purpose of the routine KERNAL ENTRIES?","The routine KERNAL ENTRIES provides information on entry and exit conditions for various routines."
"what is the purpose of the routine MEMORY MAP?","The routine MEMORY MAP provides information on memory locations and their usage."
"what is the purpose of the routine NOTES?","The routine NOTES provides additional information and notes on the usage of various routines."
