question,answer
"What is the purpose of the Pulse Width registers?", "Together these registers form a 12-bit number which linearly controls the Pulse Width (duty cycle) of the Pulse waveform on Oscillator 1."
"What is the range of values for the Pulse Width registers?", "A value of 0 or 4095 ($FF) in the Pulse Width registers will produce a constant DC output, while a value of 2048 ($800) will produce a square wave."
"What is the resolution of the Pulse Width registers?", "The pulse width resolution allows the width to be smoothly swept with no discernable stepping."
"What is the equation for calculating the Pulse Width?", "PWout = (PWn/40.95) %"
"What is the unit of measurement for the Pulse Width?", "%"
"What is the minimum value for the Pulse Width registers?", "0"
"What is the maximum value for the Pulse Width registers?", "4095 ($FF)"
"What is the effect of a value of 0 in the Pulse Width registers?", "produces a constant DC output"
"What is the effect of a value of 4095 in the Pulse Width registers?", "produces a constant DC output"
"What is the effect of a value of 2048 in the Pulse Width registers?", "produces a square wave"
