  OPENING AN RS-232 CHANNEL

    Only one RS-232 channel should be open at any time; a second OPEN
  statement will cause the buffer pointers to be reset. Any characters in
  either the transmit buffer or the receive buffer will be lost.
    Up to 4 characters can be sent in the filename field. The first two are
  the control and command register characters; the other two are reserved
  for future system options. Baud rate, parity, and other options can be
  selected through this feature.
    No error-checking is done on the control word to detect a non-
  implemented baud rate. Any illegal control word will cause the system
  output to operate at a very slow rate (below 50 baud).

  BASIC SYNTAX:

    OPEN lfn,2,0,"<control register><command register><opt baud low><opt
  baud high>"
    lfn-The logical file number (lfn) then can be any number from 1 through
  255. But be aware of the fact that if you choose a logical file number
  that is greater than 127, then a line feed will follow all carriage
  returns.
               
    <control register>- Is a single byte character (see Figure 6-1, Control
  Register Map) required to specify the baud rates. If the lower 4 bits of
  the baud rate is equal to zero (0), the <opt baud low><opt baud high>
  characters give you a rate based on the following:
    <opt baud low>=<system frequency/rate/2-100-<opt baud high>*256
    <opt baud high>=INT((system frequency/rate/2-100)/256

 
                    
  The formulas above are based on the fact that:

    system frequency = 1.02273E6 NTSC (North American TV standard)
                     = 0.98525E6 PAL (U.K. and most European TV standard)

    <command register>- Is a single byte character (see Figure 6-2, Command
  Register Map) that defines other terminal parameters. This character is
  NOT required.

  KERNAL ENTRY:

    OPEN ($FFC0) (See KERNAL specifications for more information on entry
  conditions and instructions.)

  | IMPORTANT NOTE: In a BASIC program, the RS-232 OPEN command should be |
  | performed before creating any variables or arrays because an automatic|
  | CLR is performed when an RS-232 channel is OPENed (This is due to the |
  | allocation of 512 bytes at the top of memory.) Also remember that your|
  | program will be destroyed if 512 bytes of space are not available at  |
  | the time of the OPEN statement.                                       |
