  INTERRUPT REGISTER

    The interrupt register shows the status of the four sources of
  interrupt. An interrupt latch in register 25 ($19) is set to "1" when an
  interrupt source has generated an interrupt request. The four sources of
  interrupt are:

   LATCH |ENABLE|
    BIT  | BIT  |                       WHEN SET
  -------+------+----------------------------------------------------------
    IRST | ERST | Set when (raster count) = (stored raster count)
    IMDC | EMDC | Set by sprite-DATA collision register (first collision only)
    IMMC | EMMC | Set by sprite-sprite collision register (first collision only)
    ILP  | ELP  | Set by negative transition of LP input (once per frame)
    IRQ  |      | Set high by latch set and enabled (invert of /IRQ output)

    To enable an interrupt request to set the /IRQ output to "0", the
  corresponding interrupt enable bit in register 26 ($1A) must be set to
  "1". Once an interrupt latch has been set, the latch may be cleared only
  by writing a "1" to the desired latch in the interrupt register. This
  feature allows selective handling of video interrupts without software
  required to "remember" active interrupts.
