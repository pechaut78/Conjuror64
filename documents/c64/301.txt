  RASTER REGISTER

    The raster register is a dual-function register. A read of the raster
  register 18 ($12) returns the lower 8 bits of the current raster position
  (the MSB-RC8 is located in register 17 ($11)). The raster register can be
  interrogated to implement display changes outside the visible area to
  prevent display flicker. The visible display window is from raster 51
  through raster 251 ($033-$0FB). A write to the raster bits (including
  RC8) is latched for use in an internal raster compare. When the current
  raster matches the written value, the raster interrupt latch is set.
