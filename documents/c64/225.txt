  OUTPUT TO PRINTER

    The printer is an output device similar to the screen. Your main con-
  cern when sending output to the printer is to create a format that is
  easy on the eyes. Your tools here include reversed, double-width, capital
  and lower case letters, as well as dot-programmable graphics.
    The SPC function works for the printer in the same way it works for the
  screen. However, the TAB function does not work correctly on the printer,
  because it calculates the current position on the line based on the
  cursor's position on the screen, not on the paper.
    The OPEN statement for the printer creates the channel for communi-
  cation. It also specifies which character set will be used, either upper
  case with graphics or upper and lower case.

  EXAMPLES of OPEN Statement for Printer:

    OPEN 1,4: REM UPPER CASE/GRAPHICS
    OPEN 1,4,7: REM UPPER AND LOWER CASE

    When working with one character set, individual lines can be PRINTed
  in the opposite character set. When in upper case with graphics, the
  cursor down character (CHR$(17)) switches the characters to the upper
  and lower case set. When in upper and lower case, the cursor up char-
  acter (CHR$(145)) allows upper case and graphics characters to be
  PRINTed.
    Other special functions in the printer are controlled through character
  codes. All these codes are simply PRINTed just like any other character.

  codes.
