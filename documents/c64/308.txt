  READ/WRITE (R/W)

    The read/write input, R/W, is used to determine the direction of data
  transfer on the data bus, in conjunction with /CS. When R/W is high ("1")
  data is transferred from the selected register to the data bus output.
  When R/W is low ("0") data presented on the data bus pins is loaded into
  the selected register.
