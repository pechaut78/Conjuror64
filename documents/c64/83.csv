question,answer
"Can the harmonic content of a waveform be changed?","Yes, it can be changed by using a filter."
"What are the three types of filtering available in the SID chip?","High-pass, low-pass, and bandpass filters."
"What is the purpose of the cutoff frequency in a filter?","It is the reference point for the filter."
"What is the function of register 23 in the SID chip?","To turn ON the filter for voice 1."
"What is the purpose of the low-pass filter?","It passes frequencies below the cutoff and attenuates those above."
"What is the purpose of the bandpass filter?","It passes a narrow band of frequencies around the cutoff and attenuates all others."
"What is the purpose of the notch reject filter?","It passes frequencies away from the cutoff while attenuating at the cutoff frequency."
"How are the high- and low-pass filters combined to form a notch reject filter?","By passing frequencies away from the cutoff while attenuating at the cutoff frequency."
"What determines the type of filter used in the SID chip?","Register 24."
"What are the functions of the bits in register 24?","Bit 6 controls the high-pass filter, bit 5 is the bandpass filter, and bit 4 is the low-pass filter."
"How are the cutoff frequencies determined in the SID chip?","By registers 21 and 22."
"What determines the low 3 bits of the cutoff frequency?","Register 21."
"What determines the 8 bits of the high cutoff frequency?","Register 22."
"What is the range of values for the cutoff frequency?","0 through 255."
"What is the range of values for the low cutoff frequency?","0 through 7."
"What is the purpose of filtering in the SID chip?","To change the harmonic structure of a waveform."
"What effects can be produced by changing the filtering of a sound as it goes through the ADSR phases?","Interesting effects."
"What is the importance of careful use of filtering in the SID chip?","To get just the sound you want."
"What is the purpose of the ADSR phases in the SID chip?","To produce interesting effects."
