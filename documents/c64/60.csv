"Can you POKE an X position?","To place the sprite at one of these positions, just type the X-POSITION POKE for the sprite you're using. For example, to POKE sprite I at the farthest left X position IN THE VIEWING AREA, type: POKE V+2,24."
"What are the possible values of X?","The possible values of X are 0 to 255, counting from left to right. Values 0 to 23 place all or part of the sprite OUT OF THE VIEWING AREA off the left side of the screen... values 24 to 255 place the sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA up to the 255th position."
"How do you access positions beyond the 255th position?","To get beyond the 255th position across the screen, you need to make a SECOND POKE using the numbers in the 'RIGHT X' row of the chart (Figure 3-5)."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+16?","To get beyond X position 255, you must POKE V+16 and a number (depending on the sprite). This gives you 65 additional X positions (renumbered from 0 to 65) in the viewing area on the RIGHT side of the viewing screen."
"What is the range of Y values?","The possible values of Y are 0 to 255, counting from top to bottom. Values 0 to 49 place all or part of the sprite OUT OF THE VIEWING AREA off the TOP of the screen... values 50 to 229 place the sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA."
"How do you reset the X position counter?","To get back to the left side of the screen, you must reset the most significant bit of the X position counter to 0 by typing (for sprite 1): POKE V+16, PEEK(V+16)AND 253."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+2?","To place the sprite at one of these positions, just type the X-POSITION POKE for the sprite you're using. For example, to POKE sprite I at the farthest left X position IN THE VIEWING AREA, type: POKE V+2,24."
"What is the range of X values?","The possible values of X are 0 to 255, counting from left to right. Values 0 to 23 place all or part of the sprite OUT OF THE VIEWING AREA off the left side of the screen... values 24 to 255 place the sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA up to the 255th position."

"What is the purpose of POKE V+2,255?","This moves the sprite to the RIGHT but reaches the RIGHT X LIMIT, which is 255. At this point, the 'most significant bit' in register 16 must be SET."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+16,2?","POKE V+16,2 sets the most significant bit of the X position for sprite 1 and restarts it at the 256th pixel/position on the screen."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 2?","POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 2 sets the most significant bit of the X position for sprite 1 and restarts it at the 256th pixel/position on the screen."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)AND 253?","POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)AND 253 resets the most significant bit of the X position counter to 0."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)AND 254?","POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)AND 254 turns off the control setting."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+2,0?","POKE V+2,0 displays the sprite at the NEW POSITION ZERO, which is now reset to the 256th pixel."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 1?","POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 1 and POKE V,1 must be included to place sprite 0 at the 257th pixel across the screen."
"What is the purpose of POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 2?","POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 2 sets the most significant bit of the X position for sprite 1 and restarts it at the 256th pixel/position on the screen."
