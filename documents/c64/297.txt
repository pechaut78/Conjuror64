  SCREEN BLANKING

    The display screen may be blanked by setting the DEN bit in register
  17 ($11) to a "0". When the screen is blanked, the entire screen will be
  filled with the exterior color as set in register 32 ($20). When blanking
  is active, only transparent (Phase 1) memory accesses are required, per-
  mitting full processor utilization of the system bus. sprite data, however,
  will be accessed if the sprites are not also disabled. The DEN bit must be
  set to "1" for normal video display.
