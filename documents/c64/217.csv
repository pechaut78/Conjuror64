"Can you use machine language on the Commodore 64?","Yes, there are several methods to use machine language on the Commodore 64."
"What is the SYS statement used for?","The SYS statement is used to jump to a machine language subroutine located at a specific address."
"What is the USR function used for?","The USR function is used to transfer control to a machine language subroutine located at the address stored in locations 785 and 786."
"What is the KERNAL VECTOR routine used for?","The KERNAL VECTOR routine is used to change any of the vectors in the vector table located on page 3."
"What is the HARDWARE INTERRUPT (IRQ) VECTOR used for?","The HARDWARE INTERRUPT (IRQ) VECTOR is used to change the routine that is executed every 1/60th of a second."
"Why is it important to disable interrupts before changing the IRQ vector?","It is important to disable interrupts before changing the IRQ vector to prevent unexpected behavior."
"What is the CHRGET routine used for?","The CHRGET routine is used by BASIC to get each character/token."
"How can you add new BASIC commands?","You can add new BASIC commands by specifying a special character that will occur before any of the new commands."
"What is a wedge in the context of the Commodore 64?","A wedge is a technique used to add new BASIC commands by specifying a special character that will occur before any of the new commands."
"Can you use machine language routines from BASIC?","Yes, you can use machine language routines from BASIC using the SYS statement."
"What is the difference between the SYS and USR statements?","The SYS statement jumps to a machine language subroutine located at a specific address, while the USR statement transfers control to a machine language subroutine located at the address stored in locations 785 and 786."
"How do you pass parameters between machine language routines and BASIC programs?","You can pass parameters between machine language routines and BASIC programs using the BASIC PEEK and POKE statements, and their machine language equivalents."
"What is the most useful method of combining BASIC with machine language?","The most useful method of combining BASIC with machine language is the SYS command."
"Can you have multiple SYS statements in a program?","Yes, you can have multiple SYS statements in a program, each to a different or the same machine language routine."
"What is the floating point accumulator used for?","The floating point accumulator is used to pass values between machine language routines and BASIC programs."
"What is the RTS instruction used for?","The RTS instruction is used to return control to BASIC from a machine language routine."
"What is the RTI instruction used for?","The RTI instruction is used to return control to the normal IRQ handling routine from a machine language routine."
"Can you change the KERNAL VECTOR routine?","Yes, you can change the KERNAL VECTOR routine to replace or augment the standard system routine."
"What is the KERNAL VECTOR routine used for?","The KERNAL VECTOR routine is used to change any of the vectors in the vector table located on page 3."
"Can you change the HARDWARE INTERRUPT (IRQ) VECTOR?","Yes, you can change the HARDWARE INTERRUPT (IRQ) VECTOR to replace or augment the standard system routine."
