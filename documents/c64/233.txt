  LIGHT PEN

    The light pen input latches the current screen position into a pair of
  registers (LPX, LPY) on a low-going edge. The X position register 19
  ($13) will contain the 8 MSB of the X position at the time of transition.
  Since the X position is defined by a 512-state counter (9 bits),
  resolution to 2 horizontal dots is provided. Similarly, the Y position is
  latched in its register 20 ($14), but here 8 bits provide single raster
  resolution within the visible display. The light pen latch may be
  triggered only once per frame, and subsequent triggers within the same
  frame will have no effect. Therefore, you must take several samples
  before turning the pen to the screen (3 or more samples average),
  depending upon the characteristics of your light pen.
