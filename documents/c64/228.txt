  DATA STORAGE ON FLOPPY DISKETTES

    Diskettes allow 3 different forms of data storage. Sequential files are
  similar to those on tape, but several can can be used at the same time.
  Relative files let you organize the data into records, and then read and
  replace individual records within the file. Random files let you work
  with data anywhere on the disk. They are organized into 256 byte sections
  called blocks.
    The PRINT# statement's limitations are discussed in the section on
  cassette tape. The same limitations to format apply on the disk. RETURNs
  or commas are needed to separate your data. The CHR$(0) is still read by
  the GET# statement as an empty string.
    Relative and random files both make use of separate data and command
  "channels." Data written to the disk goes through the data channel, where
  it is stored in a temporary buffer in the disk's RAM. When the record or
  block is complete, a command is sent through the command channel that
  tells the drive where to put the data, and the entire buffer is written.
    Applications that require large amounts of data to be processed are
  best stored in relative disk files. These will use the least amount of
  time and provide the best flexibility for the programmer. Your disk drive
  manual gives a complete programming guide to use of disk files.
