  ROW/COLUMN SELECT

    The normal display consists of 25 rows of 40 characters (or character
  regions) per row. For special display purposes, the display window may be
  reduced to 24 rows and 38 characters. There is no change in the format of
  the displayed information, except that characters (bits) adjacent to the
  exterior border area will now be covered by the border. The select bits
  operate as follows:


    RSEL |      NUMBER OF ROWS        |  CSEL |     NUMBER OF COLUMNS
     0   |          24 rows           |   0   |         38 columns
     1   |          25 rows           |   1   |         40 columns

  The RSEL bit is in register 17 ($11) and the CSEL bit is in register 22
  ($16). For standard display the larger display window is normally used,
  while the smaller display window is normally used in conjunction with
  scrolling.
