  RECEIVER/TRANSMITTER BUFFER BASE LOCATION POINTERS


    $00F7-REBUF-A two-byte pointer to the Receiver Buffer base location.
    $00F9-ROBUF-A two-byte pointer to the Transmitter Buffer base location.

    The two locations above are set up by the OPEN KERNAL routine, each
  pointing to a different 256-byte buffer. They are de-allocated by writing
  a zero into the high order bytes ($00F8 and $00FA), which is done by the
  CLOSE KERNAL entry. They may also be allocated/de-allocated by the
  machine language programmer for his/her own purposes, removing/creating
  only the buffer(s) required. When using a machine language program that
  allocates these buffers, care must be taken to make sure that the top of
  memory pointers stay correct, especially if BASIC programs are expected
  to run at the same time.
