CLEARING THE SCREEN - Holding the RUN/STOP key down and
then pressing the RESTORE key will clear the screen. This will not
destroy the program currently in memory, by typing the word LIST
your program will be displayed again. You will find that this technique
is useful when editing your programs. This procedure can be used to
clear the display before using the command NEW.




CURSOR KEYS - The cursor keys are two keys on the lower right hand
side of the keyboard. These keys are marked with the letters CRSR,
and arrows pointing up/down on one and left/right on the other. The
key on the left will move the cursor down when pressed, and up when
used with the SHIFT key. The cursor key on the right will move the
cursor right when pressed, and left when used with the SHIFT key. It is
possible to move the cursor anywhere on the screen using these keys.




RETURN KEY - The RETURN key is used to enter data Into memory.
When you type in a command, such as the NEW command, the
computer cannot respond until the command is entered by pressing the
RETURN key. All data is entered in this manner. After typing in a
program line, pressing the RETURN key will enter it into memory.




LINE NUMBERS - The computer has to read a sequential list of
numbers that precede each program line. Without line numbers it
would be impossible for the computer to follow the program. Line
numbers are not required if you wish to enter commands that are to be
executed immediately. NO line number can be higher than 63999.




FORMAT NEW DISK:
OPEN (file#), (divlce#),. (channel#):PRINT*, "N:NAME, ID"
EXPLANATION - Open channel, file# (can be any number from 1 tp
255, number greater than 127 should be avoided, because they can
generate unwanted linefeeds after the return character), the number 8
is the device number for the disk drive, channel number can be any
number from 2 to 15, channels 0 to 1 are reserved fpr the operating
system (used for loading and saving), 2 through 14 are used for data to
files, the command channel is 15. The prlnt# command directs data to
the disk drive, n is the abbreviation for new (this command is used
when formatting a disk fpr the first time), the name can be up to
sixteen characters, the ID is two characters, In any combination of
numbers, letters or both.
 The format can be abbreviated as follows:
OPEN15,8,15"N:NAME,ID" (press return key)
After disk is formatted the FILE that was open must be closed, using
this statement: CLQSE15 (press return key)..
HINT - If you already have a formatted disk and wish to reformat it.
There is a faster method than the standard format it is as follows:
OPEN15,8,15,"S:NAME" (press return key)




SCRATCH A FILE:
EXPLANATION - When a file is scratched from the disk it is erased.
The procedure is the same as to format, except that an S (scratch) is
used instead of the N (new), and the ID is not used. It Is possible to
scratch more than one file by using pattern matching, for example If
there are two files and their names are test and track. You would type
OPEN 15,8,15,"S:T*", both programs would be erased. Another
example of this technique, used on three files with the names, rats,
bats, and cats would be as follows:
OPEN15,8,15,"S:?ATS", this would erase all three files.
RENAME A FILE:
OPEN15,8,15 'R:NEW NAME = OLD NAME' (press return key)
(the rename command will now work with files that are open)
EXPLANATION - This Is very simple, the R stands for rename. If you
have a file with the name planes and you want to change the name to
airplanes, you would type the following, OPEN15,8,15,"R:
AIRPLANES = PLANES, (press return key).




VALIDATE A DISK:
OPEN15,8,15,"V" (press return key)
EXPLANATION - When a disk has been used over a period of time, the
directory can become disorganized. Usually this is caused by repeated
saving and scratching of files. This usually results in one or more
blocks on the disk that cannot be used because they are too small. The
validate command will reorganize the disk to make the most out of the
space that is available.




INITIALIZE THE DRIVE:
OPENISAIS,"!" (press return key)
EXPLANATION - There will be times when the disk drive will not
respond to your commands. This is caused by an error condition. When
the drive is initialized it will be returned to the same state as when first
turned on.




READING THE ERROR CHANNEL:
10 OPEN15,8,15
10 INPUT"15,A$,B$,C$,D$
30 PRINT A$,B$,C$,D$
EXPLANATION - The basic routine above will read the error channel.
The purpose of reading the error channel, is to find out what type of
error condition exists, if the red light on the drivestarts to blink and the
drive motor stops. Load and run the program above. The following ian explanation of the program above: After opening a channel, 4
variables are read and describes the error condition. The first variable
is the error number, the second is the error description, the third is the
track number on which the error occurred, and the fourth Is the block
number of the track. Lastly the 4 variables are displayed on the screen.
