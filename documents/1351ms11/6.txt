SID Register Cautions

In  the  C64 & C128,  the  SID  POT  lines  are connected to both
joystick  ports.  A 4066 analog switch is used  to switch the POT
lines  between  the  two  ports based on one of the keyboard scan
lines.  This  means that the normal keyscan interrupt temporarily
affects the values returned in the POT registers.  Therefore,  in
order  to  perform  reliable  conversions,  the POT lines must be
connected  to  the mouse for a period >1.6 millisecond before the
value in the POT register is valid.

The best way to insure this is to wedge the mouse driver software
into the IRQ handler prior  to the polled keyscan.  This more-or-
less assures that the keyscan lines have been sufficiently stable
before the POT register is read by the mouse drivers.
