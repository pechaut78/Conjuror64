The  Commodore 1351 mouse  for use with the C64/C128 product line
is a small two-button device  which is connected to either of the
joystick ports on the C64/C128.

The mouse supports two distinct operating modes:
1) Joystick mode.
2) Proportional mode.

Proportional  mode  is  usable  with  the  C64  or the C128,  and
requires  a  special  machine  language  driver  to yield optimum
performance.

Mode selection is determined when the mouse is powered up. If the
user  depresses the right mouse button when the device is powered
up, then the mouse will be in joystick mode.

If  the  user  does  not  depress the right mouse button when the
device is powered up, then the mouse will default to proportional
mode.

Joystick  mode allows you to utilize the mouse as a joystick when
using software which does not support proportional mode.
