question,answer
"How does the mouse operate in proportional mode?","In proportional mode the mouse operates by tracking movement internally and transmitting the position to the SID POTX and POTY registers every 512 microseconds without requiring software intervention."
"What is the function of the POTX register?","The POTX register is used to read the X position of the mouse."
"What is the function of the POTY register?","The POTY register is used to read the Y position of the mouse."
"What is the bit position of the POT register?","The bit position of the POT register is as follows: Bit Position | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |."
"What does the X bit in the POT register represent?","The X bit in the POT register is a don't care bit."
"What do the P5-P0 bits in the POT register represent?","The P5-P0 bits in the POT register represent the mouse position MOD 64."
"What does the N bit in the POT register represent?","The N bit in the POT register is a special (noise) bit."
"How is the left mouse button mapped?","The left mouse button is mapped to what would be the fire button on a joystick."
"How is the right mouse button mapped?","The right mouse button is mapped to what would be the UP direction on a joystick."
"How can the left and right buttons be read from software?","The left and right buttons can be read from software by polling, as they appear as joystick lines."
"Why should software make an effort to distinguish between point shorts in the keyboard matrix and a whole row or column being grounded?","Because the buttons will interfere with the keyboard map, software should make an effort to distinguish between point shorts in the keyboard matrix and a whole row or column being grounded."
"How can the position information be handled?","The position information can be handled by installing it as part of the 60 Hz interrupt routine, preferably at the beginning."
"What is the strategy for handling the position information?","The strategy is to read the mouse position MOD 64, determine if the mouse has moved by comparing the current position with a saved copy of the previous position, and if the mouse has moved, modify the pointer position appropriately."
"Why should the low order bit of the POT register be read?","The low order bit of the POT register should be read to ascertain whether the mouse has moved."
"What can happen even if the mouse is still?","Even if the mouse is still, it is possible for the POT register to oscillate between $80 and $7F, resulting in the mouse position jittering between two points."
"What is the purpose of reading the POT register?","The purpose of reading the POT register is to determine the mouse position."
"What is the frequency at which the mouse position is transmitted to the SID POTX and POTY registers?","The mouse position is transmitted to the SID POTX and POTY registers every 512 microseconds."
"How does the mouse track movement internally?","The mouse tracks movement internally within the mouse."
"What is the advantage of installing the position information as part of the 60 Hz interrupt routine?","Installing the position information as part of the 60 Hz interrupt routine allows for efficient handling of the mouse position."
"Why is it necessary to compare the current position with a saved copy of the previous position?","Comparing the current position with a saved copy of the previous position is necessary to determine if the mouse has moved."
"What happens if the mouse has moved?","If the mouse has moved, the pointer position should be modified appropriately."
"What is the purpose of the SID POTX and POTY registers?","The SID POTX and POTY registers are used to store the mouse position."
"How often is the mouse position transmitted to the SID POTX and POTY registers?","The mouse position is transmitted to the SID POTX and POTY registers every 512 microseconds."
"What is the format of the POT register?","The format of the POT register is as follows: Bit Position | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |."
"What is the significance of the N bit in the POT register?","The N bit in the POT register is a special (noise) bit."
"Why is it necessary to distinguish between point shorts in the keyboard matrix and a whole row or column being grounded?","It is necessary to distinguish between point shorts in the keyboard matrix and a whole row or column being grounded to avoid interference with the keyboard map."
"How does the mouse driver code handle the mouse position?","The mouse driver code handles the mouse position by reading the POT register and modifying the pointer position accordingly."
"What is the purpose of the POT register?","The purpose of the POT register is to store the mouse position MOD 64."
"What is the significance of the P5-P0 bits in the POT register?","The P5-P0 bits in the POT register represent the mouse position MOD 64."
"How is the mouse position handled in proportional mode?","In proportional mode, the mouse position is handled by tracking movement internally and transmitting the position to the SID POTX and POTY registers every 512 microseconds."
"What is the advantage of using proportional mode?","The advantage of using proportional mode is that it allows for efficient and accurate tracking of the mouse movement."
