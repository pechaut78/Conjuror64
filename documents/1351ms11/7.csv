"What is the purpose of the GOSUB 140 and GOSUB 330 statements in the program?","The GOSUB 140 and GOSUB 330 statements are used to initialize the mouse driver and load the mouse data into memory. The GOSUB 140 statement initializes the mouse driver by loading the data from the DATA statements into memory locations 49408 to 49537, while the GOSUB 330 statement loads the mouse data into memory locations 3584 to 3647."
"What is the significance of the POKE statements in lines 110 and 120?","The POKE statements in lines 110 and 120 are used to initialize the mouse driver and set up the interrupt vectors. The POKE statements in line 110 set up the mouse driver's interrupt vector, while the POKE statement in line 120 sets up the interrupt vector for the keyboard."
"What is the purpose of the DATA statements in the program?","The DATA statements in the program contain the machine code for the mouse driver. The DATA statements are used to store the machine code in memory, which is then executed by the C64's processor."
"How does the program load the mouse data into memory?","The program loads the mouse data into memory using the GOSUB 140 and GOSUB 330 statements, which read the data from the DATA statements and store it in memory locations 49408 to 49537 and 3584 to 3647, respectively."
"What is the purpose of the FOR loop in line 140?","The FOR loop in line 140 is used to read the mouse data from the DATA statements and store it in memory. The loop reads the data from the DATA statements and uses the GOSUB 430 subroutine to convert the data into a format that can be stored in memory."
"What is the purpose of the GOSUB 430 subroutine?","The GOSUB 430 subroutine is used to convert the hexadecimal data from the DATA statements into a format that can be stored in memory. The subroutine takes the hexadecimal data as input and returns the corresponding binary data, which is then stored in memory."
"What is the significance of the POKE V+21,1 and POKE V+39,1 statements in line 110?","The POKE V+21,1 and POKE V+39,1 statements in line 110 are used to set up the mouse driver's interrupt vector. The POKE V+21,1 statement sets the interrupt vector for the mouse driver, while the POKE V+39,1 statement sets the interrupt vector for the keyboard."
"How does the program initialize the mouse driver?","The program initializes the mouse driver by loading the mouse data into memory and setting up the interrupt vectors. The program uses the GOSUB 140 and GOSUB 330 statements to load the mouse data into memory, and the POKE statements in lines 110 and 120 to set up the interrupt vectors."
"What is the purpose of the SYS 12*4096+256 statement in line 120?","The SYS 12*4096+256 statement in line 120 is used to jump to the mouse driver's interrupt vector, which is set up by the POKE V+21,1 and POKE V+39,1 statements in line 110. The SYS statement is used to execute the machine code in the mouse driver."
"What is the purpose of the END statement in line 130?","The END statement in line 130 is used to terminate the program. The END statement is used to indicate the end of the program and return control to the operating system."
