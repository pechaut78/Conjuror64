"what is the purpose of the 4066 analog switch in the SID register?","The 4066 analog switch is used to switch the POT lines between the two joystick ports based on one of the keyboard scan lines, allowing the SID register to access the POT lines."
"How do the keyboard scan lines affect the POT registers?","The keyboard scan lines temporarily affect the values returned in the POT registers, making it necessary to connect the POT lines to the mouse for a period >1.6 millisecond before the value in the POT register is valid."
"What is the recommended approach to ensure reliable conversions in the SID register?","The best way to ensure reliable conversions is to wedge the mouse driver software into the IRQ handler prior to the polled keyscan, which assures that the keyscan lines have been sufficiently stable before the POT register is read by the mouse drivers."
"What is the minimum time required to connect the POT lines to the mouse before reading the POT register?","The POT lines must be connected to the mouse for a period >1.6 millisecond before the value in the POT register is valid."
"How does the keyscan interrupt affect the SID register?","The normal keyscan interrupt temporarily affects the values returned in the POT registers, requiring special precautions to ensure reliable conversions."
"What is the purpose of the IRQ handler in the SID register?","The IRQ handler is used to wedge the mouse driver software, ensuring that the keyscan lines have been sufficiently stable before the POT register is read by the mouse drivers."
"What happens if the POT lines are not connected to the mouse for a sufficient period of time?","If the POT lines are not connected to the mouse for a period >1.6 millisecond, the values returned in the POT registers may be unreliable, leading to errors in the SID register."
"How does the analog switch affect the joystick ports?","The 4066 analog switch switches the POT lines between the two joystick ports based on one of the keyboard scan lines, allowing the SID register to access the POT lines."
"What is the relationship between the keyboard scan lines and the POT registers?","The keyboard scan lines temporarily affect the values returned in the POT registers, requiring special precautions to ensure reliable conversions in the SID register."
"Why is it necessary to wedge the mouse driver software into the IRQ handler?","It is necessary to wedge the mouse driver software into the IRQ handler to ensure that the keyscan lines have been sufficiently stable before the POT register is read by the mouse drivers, ensuring reliable conversions in the SID register."
