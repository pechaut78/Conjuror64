"What is the basic routine to read the error channel?","The basic routine to read the error channel is: 10 OPEN15,8,15, "O15 is the error channel, 8 is the logical file number, and 15 is the secondary address. 10 INPUT'15,A$,B$,C$,D$ reads the error information into the variables A$, B$, C$, and D$. 30 PRINT A$,B$,C$,D$ displays the error information on the screen."
"What information is read when the error channel is read?","When the error channel is read, four variables are read and describe the error condition: the first variable is the error number, the second is the error description, the third is the track number on which the error occurred, and the fourth is the block number of the track."
"What is the error number in the context of reading the error channel?","The error number is the first variable read when the error channel is read and it indicates the type of error that occurred."
"What is the error description in the context of reading the error channel?","The error description is the second variable read when the error channel is read and it provides a textual description of the error that occurred."
"What is the track number in the context of reading the error channel?","The track number is the third variable read when the error channel is read and it indicates the track number on which the error occurred."
"What is the block number in the context of reading the error channel?","The block number is the fourth variable read when the error channel is read and it indicates the block number of the track on which the error occurred."
"How are the error information variables displayed on the screen?","The error information variables are displayed on the screen using the PRINT statement: 30 PRINT A$,B$,C$,D$."
"What is the importance of the OPEN statement when reading the error channel?","The OPEN statement is important when reading the error channel because it establishes the error channel as a communication channel for reading error information."
"What is the role of the INPUT statement when reading the error channel?","The INPUT statement is used to read the error information from the error channel into the variables A$, B$, C$, and D$."
