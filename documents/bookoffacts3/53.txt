_What happens in the VIC ?_

VIC (Video Interface Controller) fetches color information from memory on
each bad line. This will steal time from processor, because VIC needs to use
processor's bus cycles. Bad line is a curse in the C64 world. Fortunately
VIC's data bus is 12 bits wide and so the color data fetch for each character
position will take only one bus cycle. Color memory is physically wired to
the VIC databus lines D8-D11.

How does VIC know where to fetch the graphical information ? Some of you know
the mystical formulas needed to mess with the pixels in the hires screen.
How are these functions obtained ? Are they just magic ? No, there are some
internal counters in VIC. They always point to the right place in grafix
memory and the address is determined like this:

A13  A12 A11 A10 A9  A8  A7  A6  A5  A4  A3  A2  A1  A0
CB13 VC9 VC8 VC7 VC6 VC5 VC4 VC3 VC2 VC1 VC0 RC2 RC1 RC0

Address bits A15 and A14 change according to the selected video bank.
Address bit A13 is CB13, which may be found in VIC register $18. It
selects the right side of the video bank to be the bitmap memory. With
these bits you can set the bitmap to eight different places in memory.
However, some of them are useless because of the character ROM images and
zero page/stack. Rest of the bits come from the internal counters.

VC9-VC0 (Video Counter) forms the address bits 12-3. The counter rolls
through all 1000 character positions, 0-39 on the first eight lines, 40-79
on the second eight lines and so on. The lowest three bits come from the row
counter, RC2-RC0. This is another VIC counter and it counts the scan lines
from zero to seven.
