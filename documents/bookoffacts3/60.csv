"What is linecrunch used for in programming the C64?","Linecrunch is a routine used in C64 programming to scroll the screen upwards by convincing the VIC-II that it has already shown more character rows than it has in reality. This is done by fiddling with $D011, and the timing is critical for it to work properly."
"How does linecrunch work?","Linecrunch works by setting $D011 equal to the line before the current line, causing VIC-II to think that it is time to move on to the next character row. This results in adding 40 to the video matrix counter, 320 to the graphics memory counter, and being ready to start a bad line."
"What is the effect of linecrunch on the timing of VIC-II?","The required timing of linecrunch does not cause bad lines, allowing for another line to be skipped immediately on the successive line. Lines can only be skipped after the first character row and half of the second character row have been displayed."
"What is the impact of linecrunch on video matrix and color memory?","Because linecrunch causes VIC-II to skip rows, it will run out of video matrix and color memory before reaching the end of the screen. However, VIC-II does not stop displaying the graphics nor does it reset the internal counters. The counters keep on running and wrap around instead."
"What is the science behind programming VIC-II?","Programming VIC-II is slowly becoming a science, as it requires a deep understanding of its inner workings and the critical timing required for certain operations, such as linecrunch."
"What is the purpose of fiddling with $D011 in linecrunch?","Fiddling with $D011 in linecrunch is done to convince VIC-II that it has already shown more character rows than it has in reality, allowing for the screen to be scrolled upwards."
"What is the effect of linecrunch on the video matrix counter?","Linecrunch adds 40 to the video matrix counter, allowing for the screen to be scrolled upwards."
"What is the effect of linecrunch on the graphics memory counter?","Linecrunch adds 320 to the graphics memory counter, allowing for the screen to be scrolled upwards."
"What is the limitation of linecrunch in terms of skipping lines?","Lines can only be skipped after the first character row and half of the second character row have been displayed, due to the way VIC-II decides when there is a bad line."
"What is the impact of linecrunch on the internal counters of VIC-II?","The internal counters of VIC-II keep on running and wrap around instead of resetting when they run out of video matrix and color memory due to linecrunch."
