SCRATCH A FILE:
EXPLANATION - When a file is scratched from the disk it is erased.
The procedure is the same as to format, except that an S (scratch) is
used instead of the N (new), and the ID is not used. It Is possible to
scratch more than one file by using pattern matching, for example If
there are two files and their names are test and track. You would type
OPEN 15,8,15,"S:T*", both programs would be erased. Another
example of this technique, used on three files with the names, rats,
bats, and cats would be as follows:
OPEN15,8,15,"S:?ATS", this would erase all three files.
RENAME A FILE:
OPEN15,8,15 'R:NEW NAME = OLD NAME' (press return key)
(the rename command will now work with files that are open)
EXPLANATION - This Is very simple, the R stands for rename. If you
have a file with the name planes and you want to change the name to
airplanes, you would type the following, OPEN15,8,15,"R:
AIRPLANES = PLANES, (press return key).
