_Stretching takes time_

Besides showing the stretched sprites we need time to generate the stretching
data, unless of course, the stretch is constant. We have to have 20
one-bits for each sprite in our table. It is not feasible to determine the
state of each byte in the table, instead you clear the table and plot the
needed bits.

The routine is quite straightforward, but many optimizations may be applied
to make it faster. First we load Y with the stretch of the first line (the
y-coordinate of the data). Then we use it as an index to the table and plot
the right bit and increase Y with the expansion value. Then we do it again
until we have all of the 20 bits scattered to the table. The last sprite line
will then stretch until we stop the stretching, because the last line is
not allowed to be drawn.
