_Speed is everything_

The calculation itself is easy, but optimizing the routine is not. If all
of the sprites are stretched equally (by integer amounts) and from the same
position, the routine is the fastest possible.  You can also have variable
and smooth stretch.  Smooth stretch uses other than integer expansion values
and thus also needs more processor time.  If each sprite has to be stretched
individually, you need much more time to do it.

The fastest routine I have ever written uses some serious selfmodification
tricks. There are also some other tricks to speed up the stretch, but they
are all secret ones.. :-)  Well, what the h*ck, I will include it anyway.
By the time you read this I have already made a faster routine..

You can speed up that routine (by 17%) by unrolling the inner loop, but you
have to use a different addressing mode for ORA (zero-page). You also need
to place some restrictions to the tables used.. If you unroll both loops,
you can get ~25% faster routine than the Fore!-version.
