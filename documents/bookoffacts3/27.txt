_What can we do with this feature ?_

How can this be useful? A good use is for synchronization. Normally,
before the CPU starts to execute the raster interrupt code, it's executing
an instruction of undefined cycle-length. This execution time varies from
two to seven cycles.

With a sprite, you can do the synchronization with a minimal effort using
a DEC or INC instruction in the right place. If the processor is early,
it has to wait for the bus, otherwise it will continue to execute cycles
from the instruction.

I have never experimented with any other instruction than DEC/INC, but
some others should work also. You need an instruction which has a cycle that
do not need the bus to be available. e.g. INC $3fff will increase the
value during the fifth cycle and do not need the bus for that.
