"How can you open the side borders on a C64?","To open the side borders on a C64, you can use a trick where you select 38-column mode and then restore 40-column mode before VIC starts displaying the side border. This allows you to repeat the process in the next scan line. However, you need to be precise with the timing, as one clock cycle off can prevent the side border from opening. Additionally, you need to do the opening on every line, unlike with top/bottom borders where once per frame is sufficient."
"What are the drawbacks of opening the side borders on a C64?","There are two main drawbacks to opening the side borders on a C64. Firstly, the timing must be precise, as one clock cycle off can prevent the side border from opening. Secondly, you need to do the opening on each and every line, which can be resource-intensive. Additionally, there may be issues with bad lines, where there is not enough time to open the borders and still have all the sprites enabled. One solution is to open the borders only on seven lines and leave the bad lines unopened, or to use less than eight sprites."
"How can you deal with bad lines when opening the side borders on a C64?","One solution to dealing with bad lines when opening the side borders on a C64 is to open the borders only on seven lines and leave the bad lines unopened. Another solution is to use less than eight sprites, so that you can have six of them on a bad line and still be able to open the side borders. The old and still good solution is to scroll the bad lines, so that VIC will not start to draw the screen at all until it is allowed to do so."
"What happens if the timing is off when opening the side borders on a C64?","If the timing is off when opening the side borders on a C64, the side border will not open.

"What happens if you do not open the vertical borders when opening the side borders on a C64?","If you need to open the side borders in the bottom or top border area on a C64, you have to open the vertical borders also.
