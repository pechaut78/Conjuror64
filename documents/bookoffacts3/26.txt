_Theory and speculation_

Let's suppose that all the sprites are enabled and on the same scan line.
Then, the VIC steals 16 cycles (2 cycles for each sprite) for the memory
fetches and 3 cycles as overhead for the BA signal, for a total of 19 cycles.
However, it will be usually less because the CPU will use some of the cycles
when the bus request is pending.

If we now disable sprite 4, no cycles are released for the CPU's use. This
is because during the previous sprite 4 data fetch, the VIC already signals
that it needs the bus for the sprite 5 data fetch and BA stays low (Refer
to the timing chart). Thus, the CPU never sees BA go high during sprite 4
and 2 cycles are still lost.

Accordingly, if we only turn off sprites 1, 3 and 5 we get no cycles back
from the VIC. So in time-critical raster routines, always use sprites in
order.
