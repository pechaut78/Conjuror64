_Doing it in practice_

In practice there is no time to change color memory, but in multicolor
mode VIC uses video matrix for color information too. We have just enough
time to change the video matrix pointer, $D018. Now VIC will see a
different video matrix on each scan line, different block of memory. With
the four upper bits in the register we select one of the 16 video memories
in the video bank. Just remember that the register also selects the position
of the graphics memory (bitmap) inside the video bank.

Because we have to keep the bitmap in the same video bank, we only have half
of the bank free for video matrices. Fortunately, that's all we need to get
individual multicolor colors for each line and character position.
VIC will fetch the color data from the eight video matrices and then it will
roll on to the next 40 bytes. After eight lines and matrices we will select
the first video matrix again. (See picture 1)

Usually it is not necassary to use the whole screen for a FLI picture,
especially if you want to have a scroller or some other effects. You just
have to make sure that VIC is foolable in the usual way. The timing is also
very important, even one cycle variations in the routine entry are not
allowed. There is many ways to do the synchronization. One way is to use a
sprite, as in the previous article. (See C= Hacking, Vol. 1, Iss. 3, The
Demo Corner: Missing Cycles).
