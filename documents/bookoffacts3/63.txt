_Clipping added_

Now we can scroll the picture to any location we want, but the top
of the picture is not clipped and it is very annoying to watch.  We
need to enable the graphics at the same point regardless of the
y-scroll value.  The answer is in the extended color mode (ECM).

When both ECM and multicolor mode (MCM) are selected, VIC-II will
turn the display to black.  This is because there is a conflicting
situation and it just can't decide which color scheme to use.  The
video accesses will continue to happen just like before, the data is
just not displayed.  When the ECM bit is cleared again, the normal
multicolor graphics is shown.

So, we set the ECM bit and start to display the first eight lines of
the FLI.  Because the FLI routine already writes to $D011, we just
make sure the ECM bit is set in the first R number of writes to
$D011 and zero in all other.

The viewer is now 'complete'.  You can take a look at the code below
or you can get C64Gfx1_4.lha and see it in action yourself and not
just rely on my word.  The package includes converter programs for
BFLI, FLI and Koala (ANSI-C), couple of example pictures and viewers
for PAL and NTSC machines.
