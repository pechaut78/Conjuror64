FLI - more color to the screen by Pasi 'Albert' Ojala (po87553@cs.tut.fi or albert@cc.tut.fi)
                       
(All timings are in PAL, altho the principles will apply to NTSC too)

All of us have heard complaints about the color constraints on C64. One 8x8
pixel character position may only carry four different colors.  FLI picture
can have all of the 16 colors in one char position.  What then is this FLI
and how it is done ?

In the normal multicolor mode can one character position (4x8 pixels) have
only four different colors and one of them is the common background color.
Color codes are stored in half bytes (nybbles) to the video matrix memory
(anywhere video matrix pointer points at, normally $0400) and to the color
memory ($D800-$DBFF). In multicolor mode the color of each pixel is
determined by two bits in the graphics memory. Bit pair 11 will refer to
color memory, background color is the color for bit pair 00, and video
matrix will define the colors for bit pairs 01 and 10.
