"What is the purpose of the DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic?","The DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic is used to create a user-defined function with the parameter E. This function can be used as a substitute for any expression in a C64 Basic program."
"How do you define the maximum range of an array or group of variables in C64 Basic?","The DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement is used to define the maximum range of an array or group of variables in C64 Basic. This statement sets the maximum subscript value for the array or group of variables."
"What is the purpose of the END E(SHIFTED N) statement in C64 Basic?","The END E(SHIFTED N) statement in C64 Basic is used to stop a program from executing. This statement is typically placed at the end of a C64 Basic program to prevent it from continuing to run after it has completed its intended tasks."
"What is the EXP E(SHIFTED X) function in C64 Basic?","The EXP E(SHIFTED X) function in C64 Basic is a mathematical function that calculates the exponential value of a number. This function is used to raise the value of the base (e) to the power of the exponent (x)."
"What is the purpose of the FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic?","The FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is used to set up a variable as a counter in a for next loop. This statement is used to specify the starting value, ending value, and step value for the counter variable."
"How do you find out how much memory is free in C64 Basic?","The FRE F(SHIFTED R) statement is used to find out how much memory is free in C64 Basic. This statement returns the number of bytes that are currently available for use in the program."
"What is a user-defined function in C64 Basic?","A user-defined function in C64 Basic is a function that is created using the DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement. This function can be used as a substitute for any expression in a C64 Basic program."
"What is the purpose of the DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement in C64 Basic?","The DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement in C64 Basic is used to define the maximum range of an array or group of variables. This statement sets the maximum subscript value for the array or group of variables, allowing you to specify the size of the array or group."
"What is the syntax for the FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic?","The syntax for the FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is: FOR variable = start TO end STEP step."
"What is the purpose of the EXP E(SHIFTED X) function in C64 Basic?","The EXP E(SHIFTED X) function in C64 Basic is a mathematical function that calculates the exponential value of a number. This function is used to raise the value of the base (e) to the power of the exponent (x)."
