_More sprites_

You don't necassarily need to plot the characters in sprites to have more
than eight characters. Using a sprite multiplexing techiques you can double
or triple the number of sprites available. You can divide the scroll
vertically into several areas and because the y-coordinate of the scroll
is a sinus, there always is a fixed maximum number of sprites in each area.
This number is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the
whole scroll. I won't go into detail, but didn't want to leave this out
completely. [See picture 3.]
