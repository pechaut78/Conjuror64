"What is sprite multiplexing technique?","Sprite multiplexing technique is a method to increase the number of sprites available for use in a scroll by dividing the scroll vertically into several areas and using the y-coordinate of the scroll, which is a sinus, to determine the maximum number of sprites in each area. This number is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the whole scroll."
"How does the y-coordinate of the scroll relate to the number of sprites?","The y-coordinate of the scroll is a sinus, and this is used to determine the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area of the scroll. This number is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the whole scroll."
"What is the advantage of using sprite multiplexing technique?","The advantage of using sprite multiplexing technique is that it allows for more sprites to be displayed in a scroll than the standard 8 sprites limit. This is achieved by dividing the scroll vertically into several areas and using the y-coordinate of the scroll to determine the maximum number of sprites in each area."
"Can the number of sprites be tripled by using sprite multiplexing technique?","Yes, the number of sprites can be doubled or even tripled by using sprite multiplexing technique. This is done by dividing the scroll vertically into several areas and using the y-coordinate of the scroll to determine the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area."
"What is the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area of the scroll using sprite multiplexing technique?","The maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area of the scroll using sprite multiplexing technique is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the whole scroll. This number is determined by the y-coordinate of the scroll which is a sinus."
"What is the purpose of sprite multiplexing technique in the context of the C64?","The purpose of sprite multiplexing technique in the context of the C64 is to increase the number of sprites available for use in a scroll beyond the standard 8 sprites limit. This is achieved by dividing the scroll vertically into several areas and using the y-coordinate of the scroll to determine the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area."
"What is the relationship between the y-coordinate of the scroll and the number of sprites in each area of the scroll?","The y-coordinate of the scroll is a sinus, and this is used to determine the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area of the scroll. This number is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the whole scroll."
"What is the main idea behind sprite multiplexing technique?","The main idea behind sprite multiplexing technique is to increase the number of sprites available for use in a scroll by dividing the scroll vertically into several areas and using the y-coordinate of the scroll to determine the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area. This number is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the whole scroll."
"What is the role of the y-coordinate of the scroll in sprite multiplexing technique?","The y-coordinate of the scroll is a sinus, and this is used to determine the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area of the scroll. This number is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the whole scroll."
"What is the limitation of sprite multiplexing technique?","The limitation of sprite multiplexing technique is that the maximum number of sprites that can be displayed in each area of the scroll is always smaller than the total number of sprites in the whole scroll. This number is determined by the y-coordinate of the scroll which is a sinus."
