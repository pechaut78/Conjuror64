there are 63 cycles available to the C64 processor on each scan line, except for one which only provides 23 cycles (later referred
to as a "bad" scan line). But what happens when we add sprites and why ?

In the C64, the VIC (video interface controller) has much more to do than
just showing graphics on the screen. It also handles the memory refresh.
On each scanline, it has to refresh five rows in the memory matrix and
fetch fourty bytes of graphics data.

The VIC does all of this during the cycles (phase 1) that the processor is
not using the memory.  These cycles, however, are not sufficient when the
VIC also needs to access the character and color codes for the next row.
The memory bus can't be used by the CPU and the VIC at the same time, so CPU
access to the bus must be denied to allow the VIC to fetch its data.
Fortunately, the VIC bus (12-bit wide) allows the character (8 bits) and
color (4 bits) codes to be fetched at the same time.
