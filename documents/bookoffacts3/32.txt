_Garbage appearing_

When we open the top and bottom borders, some graphics may appear. Even
though VIC has already completed the graphics data fetches for the screen
area, it will still fetch data for every character position in top and bottom
borders. This will not do any harm though, because it does not generate any
bad lines and happens during video fetch cycles [see Missing Cycles article].
VIC reads the data from the last address in the current video bank, which is
normally $3fff and displays this over and over again.

If we change the data in this address in the border area, the change will be
visible right away. And if you synchronize the routine to the beam position,
you can have a different value on each line. If there is nothing else to do
in the border, you can get seven different values on each scan line.

The bad thing about this graphics is that it is impossible to change its
color - it is always black. It is of course possible to use inverted graphics
and change the background color. And if you have different data on each line,
you can as easily have different color(s) on each line too.

If you don't use $3fff for any effects, it is a good idea to set it to zero,
but remember to check that you do not store anything important in that
address. In one demo I just cleared $3fff and it was right in the middle of
another packed demopart. It took some time to find out what was wrong with
the other part.
