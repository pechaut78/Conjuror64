"What is the main limitation when trying to move sprites to the border on a C64?","The main limitation is that it takes so much time to change sprite x-coordinates that you can only change some of them, and there is time for five sprite moves if you don't need to change the most significant (9th) bit of the x-coordinate."
"What is an alternative way to move sprites to the border on a C64?","An alternative way is to change the data itself on each scan line and modify the sprite image pointers. This allows for variable movements and color bars, even though you don't change the x-coordinates."
"How does changing the sprite image pointers work on a C64?","You change the sprite image pointers by placing multiple sprite pictures side by side, where the graphics is shifted horizontally. By changing the image pointers, you can get the graphics to move horizontally on each line as you wish."
"What is the advantage of changing sprite image pointers over changing x-coordinates on a C64?","The advantage of changing sprite image pointers is that it takes only eight cycles, while changing x-coordinates takes more time. This allows for more time for other effects on each scan line."
"What is the maximum number of different places you can get the sprite picture on a C64 if you use only one video bank?","If you use only one video bank, you can get the sprite picture to 16 different places."
"What is the limitation of using multicolor sprites when changing sprite image pointers on a C64?","When using multicolor sprites, you have to remember that one pixel corresponds to two bits, which means the movement is not so smooth."
"What is the role of the video matrix pointer ($D018) in changing sprite image pointers on a C64?","The video matrix pointer ($D018) is used to change all of the image pointers. This takes only eight cycles and there is plenty of time left for other effects on each scan line."
"What is the importance of not changing the x-coordinates when changing sprite image pointers on a C64?","Not changing the x-coordinates when changing sprite image pointers allows for variable movements and color bars, even though you don't change the x-coordinates."
"What is the advantage of using sprite image pointers over x-coordinates in terms of time taken on a C64?","Using sprite image pointers takes only eight cycles, while changing x-coordinates takes more time. This allows for more time for other effects on each scan line."
"What is the impact of using one pixel corresponding to two bits in multicolor sprites when changing sprite image pointers on a C64?","The impact of using one pixel corresponding to two bits in multicolor sprites when changing sprite image pointers is that the movement is not so smooth."
