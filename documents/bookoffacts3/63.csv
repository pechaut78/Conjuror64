"What is the issue with scrolling the picture to any location on a C64?","The issue is that the top of the picture is not clipped, which can be annoying. To solve this, the graphics need to be enabled at the same point regardless of the y-scroll value. This can be achieved through the use of extended color mode (ECM)."
"What happens when both ECM and multicolor mode (MCM) are selected on a C64?","When both ECM and MCM are selected, the display turns to black because there is a conflicting situation and the video chip cannot decide which color scheme to use. However, the video accesses continue to happen, the data is just not displayed."
"How can the first eight lines of an FLI be displayed on a C64?","The first eight lines of an FLI can be displayed by setting the ECM bit and ensuring it is set in the first R number of writes to $D011, and zero in all other writes. The FLI routine already writes to $D011, so this ensures the first eight lines are displayed correctly."
"What is the purpose of the ECM bit in the C64's VIC-II chip?","The ECM bit in the C64's VIC-II chip is used to enable extended color mode. When set, it allows for the display of the first eight lines of an FLI. When cleared, normal multicolor graphics are shown."
"What is included in the C64Gfx1_4.lha package?","The C64Gfx1_4.lha package includes converter programs for BFLI, FLI, and Koala (ANSI-C), example pictures, and viewers for PAL and NTSC machines."
