LINE NUMBERS - The computer has to read a sequential list of
numbers that precede each program line. Without line numbers it
would be impossible for the computer to follow the program. Line
numbers are not required if you wish to enter commands that are to be
executed immediately. NO line number can be higher than 63999.
