Even odder ?_

Something very weird happens when we clear the expansion bit right when VIC
is adding three to the sprite image counters. The values in the counters will
be increased only by two, and the data is then read from the wrong place.

Normally the display of a sprite ends when VIC has shown all of the 21
lines of the sprite (the counter will end up to $3f). If there has been a
counter mixup, $3f is not reached after 21 lines and VIC will go on counting
and will display the sprite again, now normally. If we fool the counter only
once, the counter value $3f is reached when the sprite is displayed twice.
