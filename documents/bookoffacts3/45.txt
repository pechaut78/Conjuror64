_Character hack_

The whole DYCP started using character graphics. You plot six character
rows where the character (screen) codes increase to the right and down.
This area is then used like a small bitmap screen. Each of the text chars
are displayed one byte at a time on each six rows high character columns.
This 240 character positions big piece of screen can be moved horizontally
using the x-scroll register (three lowest bits in $D016) and after eight
pixels you move the text itself, like in any scroll. The screen is of course
reduced to 38 columns wide to hide the jittering on the sides.

A good coder may also change the character sets during the display and
even double the size of the scroll, but because the raster time happens
to go to waste using this technique anyway, that is not very feasible. There
are also other difficulties in this approach, the biggest is the time needed
to clear the display.
