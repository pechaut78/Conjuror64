"What is the fastest possible routine for stretching sprites equally on a C64?","The fastest possible routine for stretching sprites equally on a C64 is achieved when all sprites are stretched equally (by integer amounts) and from the same position. This results in the fastest calculation due to the simplicity of the operation."
"How does smooth stretch affect the speed of the routine?","Smooth stretch uses other than integer expansion values and thus requires more processor time, making it slower than stretching sprites equally."
"What is the impact of stretching sprites individually on the speed of the routine?","Stretching sprites individually requires much more time to do it, resulting in a slower routine compared to stretching sprites equally."
"What tricks can be used to speed up the stretch routine?","Some tricks to speed up the stretch routine include self-modification tricks, unrolling the inner loop, and using a different addressing mode for ORA (zero-page). However, these tricks may require placing restrictions on the tables used."
"What is the percentage increase in speed achieved by unrolling the inner loop?","Unrolling the inner loop can result in a 17% increase in speed, but it requires using a different addressing mode for ORA (zero-page) and placing restrictions on the tables used."
"What is the percentage increase in speed achieved by unrolling both loops?","Unrolling both loops can result in a ~25% increase in speed compared to the Fore!-version."
"What is the impact of using self-modification tricks on the speed of the routine?","Self-modification tricks can significantly speed up the routine, but they can make the code more complex and difficult to maintain."
"What is the impact of using different addressing modes for ORA on the speed of the routine?","Using a different addressing mode for ORA can result in a faster routine, but it may require placing restrictions on the tables used and can make the code more complex."
"What is the significance of the statement 'By the time you read this I have already made a faster routine' in the text?","This statement suggests that the author is constantly improving the routine and finding new ways to optimize it, indicating that there may be even faster routines possible in the future."
"What is the impact of placing restrictions on the tables used on the speed of the routine?","Placing restrictions on the tables used can result in a faster routine, but it may limit the flexibility and generality of the code."
