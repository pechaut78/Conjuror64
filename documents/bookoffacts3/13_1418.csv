question,answer
"What is the purpose of the DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic?","The DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic is used to create a user-defined substitute. This statement allows you to define a function with a specified name (in this case, D) and a single parameter (E), which can be shifted to modify its behavior."
"What does the DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement do in C64 Basic?","The DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement in C64 Basic is used to define the maximum range of an array or group of variables. In this case, it is defining the array D with a maximum range of I (where I can be shifted to modify the range)."
"What is the purpose of the END E(SHIFTED N) statement in C64 Basic?","The END E(SHIFTED N) statement in C64 Basic is used to stop a program from executing. This statement is typically used to indicate the end of a program and will cause the program to terminate when it is reached."
"What does the EXP E(SHIFTED X) mathematical function do in C64 Basic?","The EXP E(SHIFTED X) mathematical function in C64 Basic calculates the base of the natural logarithm (e) raised to the power of the input value (X). This function is used to calculate the exponential value of a number."
"What is the purpose of the FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic?","The FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is used to set up a variable as a counter that is used in a for next loop. This statement allows you to specify the starting value of the counter, the ending value, and the increment (if any) for the loop."
"What does the FRE F(SHIFTED R) statement do in C64 Basic?","The FRE F(SHIFTED R) statement in C64 Basic gives the amount of memory that is free. This statement calculates the amount of available memory in the system and returns it as a value that can be used in your program."
"What is a user-defined substitute in C64 Basic?","A user-defined substitute in C64 Basic is a function that is created using the DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement. This function allows you to define a custom name and parameter for a function, which can be used in place of a built-in function or statement in your code."
"What is an array in C64 Basic?","An array in C64 Basic is a group of variables that are accessed using a single name and an index value. Arrays allow you to store and manipulate large amounts of data using a single variable name, making it easier to work with and organize your data."
"What is a for next loop in C64 Basic?","A for next loop in C64 Basic is a type of loop that is controlled using the FOR F(SHIFTED O) and NEXT statements. This loop allows you to specify a counter variable, a starting value, an ending value, and an increment (if any), and will execute the code between the FOR and NEXT statements for each value of the counter variable within the specified range."
"What is the base of the natural logarithm in C64 Basic?","The base of the natural logarithm in C64 Basic is e, which is approximately equal to 2.71828. This value is used as the base for the EXP E(SHIFTED X) mathematical function, which calculates the exponential value of a number."
