"What is the mechanism that handles the vertical enlargement of sprites in the C64?","The vertical enlargement of sprites in the C64 is handled using five simple logical ports and a Set-Reset flip-flop for each sprite. The flip-flop determines whether to jump to the next sprite line or not based on the state of the flip-flop and the Y-enlargement bit."
"What is the function of a Set-Reset flip-flop in the context of C64's sprite handling?","A Set-Reset flip-flop in the C64 determines whether to jump to the next sprite line or not based on the inputs R (reset) and S (set). If R is one, Q goes to zero, and if S is one, Q goes to one. Otherwise, the state of the flip-flop does not change."
"What determines whether the flip-flop is set or reset in the C64's sprite handling?","The flip-flop is set if either the Y-enlargement bit is zero or the state of the flip-flop is zero at the end of a scan line. The flip-flop is reset if both the state and the Y-enlargement are ones at the end of the line."
"What is the effect of clearing the bit in the vertical expansion register in the C64?","Clearing the bit in the vertical expansion register sets the flip-flop regardless of the electron beam position on the scan line. This results in the addition of three bytes to the data counter."
"What is the effect of setting the bit again before the end of the line in the C64?","If the bit is set again before the end of the line, the flip-flop is cleared and VIC will be displaying the same sprite line again. This way, any of the lines in any of the sprites may be stretched as wanted."
"What is the condition for the add enable to be set in the C64?","At any time, if vertical expand is zero, the add enable is set to one."
"What is the condition for the state to be cleared in the C64?","At the end of the line - before adding - the state is cleared if vertical expand is one."
"What is the role of the five simple logical ports in the C64's sprite handling?","The five simple logical ports in the C64's sprite handling determine the state of the Set-Reset flip-flop, which in turn determines whether to jump to the next sprite line or not."
"What is the purpose of the Y-enlargement bit in the C64's sprite handling?","The Y-enlargement bit in the C64's sprite handling determines whether the flip-flop is set or reset at the end of a scan line."
"What is the effect of setting the flip-flop in the C64's sprite handling?","Setting the flip-flop results in the addition of three bytes to the data counter and the display of the same sprite line again, allowing for any of the lines in any of the sprites to be stretched as wanted."
