"What is the restriction on the vertical position difference between three consecutive text characters in relation to sprites on a C64?","The restriction is that the vertical position difference between three consecutive text characters must be less than 14 pixel lines. Each sprite's Y-coordinate will be the minimum of the three characters residing in that sprite. Line offsets inside the sprites are then obtained by subtracting the sprite y-coordinate from the character y-coordinate."
"How can horizontal scrolling be achieved on a C64?","Horizontal scrolling can be achieved by moving sprites like you would use the character horizontal scroll register and after eight pixels, reset the sprite positions and scroll the text one position in memory. A new character for the scroll should be fetched as well."
"What happens when there are different and changing sprite y-coordinates while opening the side borders on a C64?","When there are different and changing sprite y-coordinates while opening the side borders on a C64, it becomes more difficult. However, there are at least two different ways to do it."
"What is the role of the sprite's Y-coordinate in relation to the character's y-coordinate on a C64?","The sprite's Y-coordinate is the minimum of the three characters residing in that sprite. Line offsets inside the sprites are then obtained by subtracting the sprite y-coordinate from the character y-coordinate."
"What is the maximum vertical position difference allowed between three consecutive text characters on a C64?","The maximum vertical position difference allowed between three consecutive text characters on a C64 is less than 14 pixel lines."
"How does the sprite's Y-coordinate affect the character's y-coordinate in a sprite on a C64?","The sprite's Y-coordinate affects the character's y-coordinate in a sprite on a C64 by obtaining line offsets inside the sprites by subtracting the sprite y-coordinate from the character y-coordinate."
"What is the impact of sprite y-coordinates on side border opening on a C64?","When there are different and changing sprite y-coordinates, opening the side borders become a great deal more difficult on a C64."
"What is the role of the character horizontal scroll register in horizontal scrolling on a C64?","The character horizontal scroll register is used to move sprites horizontally while achieving horizontal scrolling on a C64."
"What happens every eight pixels during horizontal scrolling on a C64?","During horizontal scrolling on a C64, the sprite positions are reset and the text is scrolled one position in memory every eight pixels."
"What is the restriction on vertical movement with sprites on a C64?","The restriction on vertical movement with sprites on a C64 is that the vertical position difference between three consecutive text characters must be less than 14 pixel lines."
