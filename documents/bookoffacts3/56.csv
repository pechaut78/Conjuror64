"What is the impact of a bad line on the available cycles for each scan line on the C64?","A bad line steals 40 cycles, leaving only 23 cycles for each scan line on the C64. This is enough for changing the video matrix and background color, but not enough for other tasks such as changing the vertical scroll register, video matrix pointer, and background color simultaneously."
"What is the reason for not being able to have sprites in front of a FLI picture on the C64?","The reason for not being able to have sprites in front of a FLI picture on the C64 is that there is not enough time to change the vertical scroll register, video matrix pointer, and background color simultaneously."
"What are the benefits of using FLI on the C64?","FLI on the C64 provides two selectable colors for each character position and line, each scan line can have its own background color, and each character position still has its own character color from color memory. This allows for a potential of 25 different colors, although VIC only has 16."
"How many cycles are available for each scan line on the C64 after accounting for a bad line?","After accounting for a bad line, there are 23 cycles available for each scan line on the C64."
"What is the purpose of the vertical scroll register, video matrix pointer, and background color on the C64?","The purpose of the vertical scroll register, video matrix pointer, and background color on the C64 is to change the video matrix, background color, and other visual elements. However, there is not enough time to change these elements simultaneously when using FLI."
"What is the maximum number of different colors that can be displayed using FLI on the C64?","In theory, each character position on the C64 could have 25 different colors when using FLI. However, VIC only has 16 colors."
"What is the role of the video matrix on the C64?","The video matrix on the C64 is responsible for displaying visual elements on the screen. The video matrix can be changed using the video matrix pointer."
"What is the impact of the limited number of cycles available on each scan line on the C64?","The limited number of cycles available on each scan line on the C64 impacts the ability to change visual elements such as the vertical scroll register, video matrix pointer, and background color simultaneously."
"What is the role of the background color on the C64?","The background color on the C64 is responsible for setting the color of the background of the screen. The background color can be changed using FLI."
"What is the purpose of FLI on the C64?","FLI on the C64 is a technique used to display two selectable colors for each character position and line, each scan line can have its own background color, and each character position still has its own character color from color memory. This allows for a potential of 25 different colors, although VIC only has 16."
