"What is a raster routine and why is it necessary for C64 programming?","A raster routine is a crucial part of C64 programming because it allows you to access the VIC registers on each line during the stretch. This is necessary for tasks such as opening the side borders, changing the background color, shifting the screen downwards, and handling stretching using stretch data."
"What happens at the beginning of a raster routine in the demo program?","At the beginning of the raster routine in the demo program, there is some timing, followed by a loop that lasts exactly 46 clock cycles and takes one scan line to execute. Inside the loop, the necessary modifications are made to the vertical scroll register, the background color is changed, and the side borders are opened."
"What is the purpose of the loop in the raster routine of the demo program?","The purpose of the loop in the raster routine of the demo program is to execute a specific set of instructions, including modifying the vertical scroll register, changing the background color, and opening the side borders. The loop lasts for 46 clock cycles and takes one scan line to execute."
"What modifications are made to the vertical scroll register in the raster routine of the demo program?","In the raster routine of the demo program, modifications are made to the vertical scroll register to handle the stretching of sprites. A zero-bit in the stretch data means that the corresponding sprite will be stretched, while a one-bit means that VIC is allowed to go to the next line of the sprite data."
"What is the role of the stretch data in the raster routine of the demo program?","The stretch data in the raster routine of the demo program is used to handle the stretching of sprites. A zero-bit in the stretch data means that the corresponding sprite will be stretched, while a one-bit means that VIC is allowed to go to the next line of the sprite data."
"What is the significance of the clock cycles in the raster routine of the demo program?","The clock cycles in the raster routine of the demo program are important because they determine the length of the loop and the time it takes to execute. The loop in the raster routine lasts for 46 clock cycles and takes one scan line to execute."
"What is the role of the scan line in the raster routine of the demo program?","The scan line in the raster routine of the demo program is the time it takes for the loop to execute. The loop in the raster routine lasts for 46 clock cycles and takes one scan line to execute."
"What modifications are made to the background color in the raster routine of the demo program?","In the raster routine of the demo program, the background color is changed after the necessary modifications are made to the vertical scroll register. This allows for different background colors to be displayed during the execution of the raster routine."
"What is the purpose of opening the side borders in the raster routine of the demo program?","The purpose of opening the side borders in the raster routine of the demo program is to allow for the display of graphics or other information in the border areas of the screen. This can be useful for tasks such as displaying status information or creating unique visual effects."
"What is the role of the vertical scroll register in the raster routine of the demo program?","The vertical scroll register in the raster routine of the demo program is used to handle the stretching of sprites. Modifications are made to the vertical scroll register to stretch or not stretch the sprites based on the stretch data."
