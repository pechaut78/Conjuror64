"What is FLI and how is it used to overcome color constraints on C64?","FLI (Flexible Line Interpretation) is a technique used to display 16 colors in a single character position on a C64. It works by modifying the raster beam's vertical position, allowing for different color codes to be used for each scanline. This results in a more flexible color palette compared to the normal multicolor mode, where only four different colors can be displayed in a character position."
"What is the normal multicolor mode in C64?","In the normal multicolor mode of C64, each character position (4x8 pixels) can have four different colors, one of which is the common background color. The color codes for these four colors are stored in half bytes (nybbles) in the video matrix memory and color memory ($D800-$DBFF). The color of each pixel is determined by two bits in the graphics memory. Bit pair 11 refers to the color memory, background color is used for bit pair 00, and the video matrix defines the colors for bit pairs 01 and 10."

"What is the role of the video matrix in the normal multicolor mode?","In the normal multicolor mode, the video matrix defines the colors for bit pairs 01 and 10. It is used in conjunction with the graphics memory to determine the color of each pixel in a character position."

"What is the difference between FLI and the normal multicolor mode?","FLI allows for all 16 colors to be displayed in a single character position, while the normal multicolor mode only allows for four different colors. FLI achieves this by modifying the raster beam's vertical position, allowing for different color codes to be used for each scanline."
"How does FLI modify the raster beam's vertical position?","FLI modifies the raster beam's vertical position by using a technique called raster interrupts. This allows for different color codes to be used for each scanline, resulting in a more flexible color palette."
"What are raster interrupts in the context of FLI?","Raster interrupts in the context of FLI are used to modify the raster beam's vertical position. This allows for different color codes to be used for each scanline, resulting in a more flexible color palette."
"What is the advantage of using FLI over the normal multicolor mode?","The advantage of using FLI over the normal multicolor mode is that it allows for all 16 colors to be displayed in a single character position. This results in a more flexible color palette compared to the normal multicolor mode, where only four different colors can be displayed in a character position."
