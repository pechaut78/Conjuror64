_How to disable the vertical borders_

When VIC (Video Interface Controller) has displayed all character rows,
it will start displaying the vertical border area. It will start displaying
the characters again in top of the screen. The row select register sets the
number of character lines on the screen. If we select the 24-row display
when VIC is drawing the last (25th) row, it does not start to draw the
border at all !  VIC will think that it already started to draw the border.

The 25-row display must be selected again in the top of the screen, so that
the border may be opened in the next frame too. The number of displayed rows
can be selected with the bit 3 in $d011. If the bit is set, VIC will display
25 rows and 24 rows otherwise. We have to clear the bit somewhere during the
last row (raster lines $f2-$fa) and set it again in top of the screen or at
least somewhere before the last row (line $f2). This has to be done in every
frame (50 times per second in PAL).
