"What is the purpose of changing the video matrix pointer, $D018, in multicolor mode on a C64?", "The purpose of changing the video matrix pointer, $D018, in multicolor mode on a C64 is to allow VIC to see a different video matrix on each scan line, which allows for individual multicolor colors for each line and character position. This is possible because VIC fetches the color data from the eight video matrices and then rolls on to the next 40 bytes, and after eight lines and matrices, it will select the first video matrix again."
"How does the video memory bank work in relation to the video matrix and bitmap in multicolor mode on a C64?", "The video memory bank in multicolor mode on a C64 is divided into two parts: one for the bitmap (graphics memory) and the other for the video matrices. The register that selects the position of the graphics memory inside the video bank also selects one of the 16 video memories in the video bank. Since the bitmap needs to be kept in the same video bank, only half of the bank is free for video matrices. However, this is enough to get individual multicolor colors for each line and character position."
"Why is it not necessary to use the whole screen for a FLI picture on a C64?", "It is not necessary to use the whole screen for a FLI picture on a C64, especially if you want to have a scroller or other effects. This is because VIC can be fooled in the usual way by making sure that the timing is correct and that there are no more than one cycle variations in the routine entry."
"What is one way to synchronize the timing of a FLI picture on a C64?", "One way to synchronize the timing of a FLI picture on a C64 is to use a sprite, as described in C= Hacking, Vol. 1, Iss. 3, The Demo Corner: Missing Cycles."
"What is the role of the video matrix in multicolor mode on a C64?", "The video matrix in multicolor mode on a C64 is used to determine the color information for each scan line. The video matrix pointer, $D018, is changed to allow VIC to see a different video matrix on each scan line, which allows for individual multicolor colors for each line and character position."
"How does VIC select the position of the graphics memory (bitmap) inside the video bank in multicolor mode on a C64?", "VIC selects the position of the graphics memory (bitmap) inside the video bank in multicolor mode on a C64 using the same register that selects one of the 16 video memories in the video bank. This means that the bitmap needs to be kept in the same video bank, leaving only half of the bank free for video matrices. However, this is enough to get individual multicolor colors for each line and character position."
"What is the maximum number of video memories available in the video bank in multicolor mode on a C64?", "There are 16 video memories available in the video bank in multicolor mode on a C64. These video memories are selected using the same register that selects the position of the graphics memory (bitmap) inside the video bank."
"What is the size of the video matrices in the video bank in multicolor mode on a C64?", "The video matrices in the video bank in multicolor mode on a C64 are 40 bytes in size. VIC fetches the color data from the eight video matrices and then rolls on to the next 40 bytes. After eight lines and matrices, it will select the first video matrix again."
"What is the role of the four upper bits in the video matrix pointer, $D018, in multicolor mode on a C64?", "The four upper bits in the video matrix pointer, $D018, in multicolor mode on a C64 are used to select one of the 16 video memories in the video bank. These bits also determine the position of the graphics memory (bitmap) inside the video bank."
"What is the maximum number of lines that can be used for a FLI picture on a C64?", "The maximum number of lines that can be used for a FLI picture on a C64 is eight. After eight lines and matrices, VIC will select the first video matrix again."
