_A little feature_

VIC does not like it when we change the vertical scroll register ($D011),
and is a bit annoyed. It 'sees' code 255 (light gray) in video matrix
and 9 (brown) in the color memory instead of the correct values stored there.
Actually the color value seems to be the lower nybble of the data byte
currently on the data bus (accessed by the processor (LDA#=$A9)).
Unfortunately there is no chance to do the register change in the border
and thus the three leftmost character columns are a bit useless, because
the colors are fixed.

However, this doesn't mean that you can't use those three columns. FLI
editors may not support the fixed colors though, so it may be hard to use
them.
