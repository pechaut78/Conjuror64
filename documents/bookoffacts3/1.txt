CURSOR KEYS - The cursor keys are two keys on the lower right hand
side of the keyboard. These keys are marked with the letters CRSR,
and arrows pointing up/down on one and left/right on the other. The
key on the left will move the cursor down when pressed, and up when
used with the SHIFT key. The cursor key on the right will move the
cursor right when pressed, and left when used with the SHIFT key. It is
possible to move the cursor anywhere on the screen using these keys.
