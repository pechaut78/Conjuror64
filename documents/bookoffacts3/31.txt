_Scrolling the screen_

VIC begins to draw the screen from the first bad line. VIC will know what
line is a bad line by comparing its scan line counter to the vertical
scroll register : when they match, the next line is a bad line. If we change
the vertical scroll register ($d011), the first bad line will move also.
If we do this on every line, the line counter in VIC will never match with
it and the drawing never starts (until it is allowed to do so).

When we don't have to worry about bad lines, we have enough time to open the
borders and do some other effects too. It is not necassary to change the
vertical scroll on every line to get rid of the bad lines, just make sure
that it never matches the line counter (or actually the least significant
8 bits).

You can even scroll the bad lines independently and you have FLD - Flexible
Line Distance. You just allow a bad line when it is time to display the next
character row. With this you can bounce the lines or scroll a hires picture
very fast down the screen. But this has not so much to do with borders, so
I will leave it to another article. (Just send requests and I might start
writing about FLD ..)
