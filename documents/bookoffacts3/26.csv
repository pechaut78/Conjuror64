"What happens to the CPU cycles when all sprites are enabled and on the same scan line?","When all sprites are enabled and on the same scan line, the VIC steals 19 cycles (16 cycles for memory fetches and 3 cycles for overhead) for each sprite. However, the CPU will use some of the cycles when the bus request is pending, making it usually less than 19 cycles."
"What happens if sprite 4 is disabled when all sprites are on the same scan line?","Disabling sprite 4 does not release any cycles for the CPU's use. This is because during the previous sprite 4 data fetch, the VIC already signals that it needs the bus for the sprite 5 data fetch, and BA stays low. The CPU never sees BA go high during sprite 4 and 2 cycles are still lost."
"What is the effect of turning off sprites 1, 3 and 5 on the CPU cycles?","Turning off sprites 1, 3 and 5 does not release any cycles for the CPU. This is because the VIC signals that it needs the bus for the next sprite data fetch before the current sprite data fetch is complete."
"What is the recommended order for using sprites in time-critical raster routines?","In time-critical raster routines, it is recommended to use sprites in order to avoid losing CPU cycles."
"What is the overhead cost of each sprite on the same scan line?","The overhead cost of each sprite on the same scan line is 3 cycles for the BA signal."
"What is the total cost of memory fetches for each sprite on the same scan line?","The total cost of memory fetches for each sprite on the same scan line is 16 cycles."
"What happens to the BA signal when the VIC signals that it needs the bus for the next sprite data fetch?","The BA signal stays low, and the CPU never sees it go high during the current sprite data fetch."

"What is the effect of disabling a sprite before the VIC signals that it needs the bus for the next sprite data fetch?","Disabling a sprite before the VIC signals that it needs the bus for the next sprite data fetch may release cycles for the CPU's use."
"What is the recommended practice for using sprites in time-critical raster routines to avoid losing CPU cycles?","The recommended practice for using sprites in time-critical raster routines is to use sprites in order to avoid losing CPU cycles."
