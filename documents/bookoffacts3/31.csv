"What is the role of the vertical scroll register ($d011) in the process of scrolling the screen on a C64?","The vertical scroll register ($d011) is used by VIC to determine the first bad line from which to start drawing the screen. When the scan line counter of VIC matches the value in the vertical scroll register, the next line is considered a bad line. Changing the value of the vertical scroll register causes the first bad line to move accordingly."
"What is a bad line in the context of scrolling the screen on a C64?","A bad line is a line that VIC starts to draw the screen from. VIC determines a line as a bad line by comparing its scan line counter to the vertical scroll register. When they match, the next line is considered a bad line."
"How can changing the vertical scroll register affect the screen drawing process on a C64?","Changing the vertical scroll register on every line can prevent the line counter in VIC from matching with it, causing the drawing process to never start until it is allowed to do so."
"What is not necessary to get rid of bad lines when scrolling the screen on a C64?","It is not necessary to change the vertical scroll on every line to get rid of bad lines. It is sufficient to ensure that the vertical scroll never matches the line counter (or the least significant 8 bits)."
"What is FLD (Flexible Line Distance) in the context of scrolling the screen on a C64?","FLD is a technique that allows scrolling the bad lines independently. This can be used to bounce the lines or scroll a hires picture very fast down the screen. However, it has not much to do with borders."
"How can FLD be used to scroll a hires picture very fast down the screen on a C64?","By allowing a bad line when it is time to display the next character row, the lines can be scrolled very fast down the screen. This technique is called FLD (Flexible Line Distance)."
"What is not necessary to worry about when opening the borders and doing other effects while scrolling the screen on a C64?","When there are no bad lines to worry about, there is enough time to open the borders and do other effects. It is not necessary to change the vertical scroll on every line to achieve this."
"What is the role of the line counter in VIC when scrolling the screen on a C64?","The line counter in VIC is used to determine the first bad line from which to start drawing the screen.

"What is the impact of changing the vertical scroll register on every line when scrolling the screen on a C64?","Changing the vertical scroll register on every line can prevent the line counter in VIC from matching with the vertical scroll register, causing the drawing process to never start until it is allowed to do so."
"What is the significance of the least significant 8 bits in the context of scrolling the screen on a C64?","The least significant 8 bits are significant in determining whether the vertical scroll matches the line counter. It is sufficient to ensure that the vertical scroll never matches the least significant 8 bits to get rid of bad lines."
