_Want to go to the border ?_

Some coders are always trying to get all effects ever done using the C64 go
to the border, and even successfully. The easiest way is to use only a region
of 21 pixels high - sprites - and move the text exactly like in characters.
In fact only the different addressing causes the differences in the code.

Eight horizontally expanded sprites will be just enough to fill the side
borders. You can also mix these techiques, but then you have the usual
"chars-in-the-screen-while-border-opened"-problems (however, they are
solvable). Unfortunately sprite-dycp is even more slower than char-dycp.
