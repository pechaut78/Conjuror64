"How does the number of character lines on the screen affect the display of the vertical border area in VIC?","When VIC has displayed all character rows, it will start displaying the vertical border area. If 24-row display is selected when VIC is drawing the last (25th) row, it does not start to draw the border at all. This is because VIC will think that it already started to draw the border. The 25-row display must be selected again in the top of the screen, so that the border may be opened in the next frame too."
