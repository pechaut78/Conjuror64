"How can you position the sprites to stretch them horizontally on a C64?","To stretch the sprites horizontally on a C64, you can position all of the sprites where the scroll will be when it is in its highest position. Then, stretch the first and last line of each sprite so that the 19 sprite lines in the middle will be on the desired place. This can be done because all of the sprites are present on all of the scan lines and they steal a constant amount of time. However, it's important to note that this approach will result in losing two sprite lines, which may not be desirable if they are needed for graphics."
"What is the advantage of stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64?","Stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64 allows you to open the borders more easily, as all of the sprites are present on all of the scan lines and they steal a constant amount of time. This means that you can open the borders without worrying about the sprites stealing additional time on certain scan lines."
"What is the disadvantage of stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64?","The disadvantage of stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64 is that you will lose two sprite lines, which may not be desirable if they are needed for graphics. Additionally, the first and last line of each sprite will be stretched, so you may not want to use them for graphics."
"What is an alternative approach to stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64?","An alternative approach to stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64 is to unroll the routine and let another routine count the sprites present in each line. The time the routine uses can then be changed accordingly to save time during the display for other effects, like color bars. This approach can be more difficult to implement, but it allows you to save time during the display for other effects."

"What is the minimum number of cycles that stretching will take on each raster line on a C64?","Stretching will take at least 12 cycles on each raster line on a C64. This is because the sprites must be stretched horizontally, which requires a certain number of cycles to complete. If the sinus is constant (user is not allowed to change it), it is usually possible to embedd the count routine directly to the border opening part of the routine."
"What is the advantage of embedding the count routine directly to the border opening part of the routine when stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64?","The advantage of embedding the count routine directly to the border opening part of the routine when stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64 is that it can be done if the sinus is constant (user is not allowed to change it). This can save time during the display for other effects, as the count routine is integrated directly into the border opening part of the routine."
"What is the disadvantage of embedding the count routine directly to the border opening part of the routine when stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64?","The disadvantage of embedding the count routine directly to the border opening part of the routine when stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64 is that it can only be done if the sinus is constant (user is not allowed to change it). This means that the user does not have the ability to change the sinus, which may be a limitation in certain situations."
"What is the impact of the sinus being constant on the ability to embed the count routine directly to the border opening part of the routine when stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64?", "If the sinus is constant (user is not allowed to change it), it is usually possible to embedd the count routine directly to the border opening part of the routine when stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64.

This is because the sinus is not constant, which means that the user has the ability to change it. In this case, it may be necessary to use a different approach to stretching the sprites horizontally on a C64."
