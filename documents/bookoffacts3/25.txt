he BA signal_

When the VIC wants to use the bus, the BA (Bus Available) signal goes
inactive. This will happen three cycles before the bus must be released !
During these three cycles, the CPU must complete all memory accesses or
delay them until it has the bus again.

The CPU either completes the current instruction in the remaining cycles
or sits and waits for the bus to become available again. It can't execute
a new instruction as long as it doesn't have the bus. This is why cycles
seem to be lost (besides those stolen directly for the sprites). Usually,
all 8 sprites take 17 cycles while one sprite takes three cycles. However,
the CPU may continue to execute an instruction if it does not use the bus.
