_Horizontal scrolling_

This new graphics data also obeys the horizontal scroll register ($D016), so
you can do limited tech-tech effects in the border too. You can also use
sprites and open the sideborders. You can see an example of the tech-tech
effect in the first example program. Multicolor mode select has no effect
on this data. You can read more about tech-tech effects in a future article.
