_Smoother and smoother_

Why be satisfied with a scroll with only 40 different slices horizontally ?
It should be possible to count own coordinates for each pixel column on
the scroll. In fact the program won't be much different, but the routine
must also mask the unwanted bits and write the byte to memory with ORA+STA.
When you think about it more, it is obvious that this takes a generous amount
of time, handling every bit seperately will take much more than eight times
the time a simple LDA+STA takes. Some coders have avoided this by plotting
the same character to different character sets simultaneously and then
changing the charsets appropriately, but the resulting scroll won't be much
larger than 96x32 pixels.
