_A software graphics mode - FLI_

VIC will systematically go through every byte in the bitmap memory, but how
does it know where and when to get the color information ? This is where
the main principle of FLI (Flexible Line Interpretation) lies. Color data
is fetched (and this means it is a bad line), when the line counter matches
with the vertical scroll register. VC9-VC0 defines where the color data is
inside the video matrix and color memory.

If we change the vertical scroll register, we can fool VIC to think that
every line is a bad line, so it will fetch the color information on every
line too. Because VIC will fetch the colors continuosly, we can get
independent colors on each scan line. We just have to change colors and VIC
will handle the rest. Unfortunately the result is the loss of 40 processor
cycles per line (see the Missing Cycles article for more information about
VIC stealing cycles).
