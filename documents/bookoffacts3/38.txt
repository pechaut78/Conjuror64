_Fiddling_

I don't think the distorted counter effect can be used for anything, but
there is many things where the variable stretching could be used. When you
open the borders, you can be sure that there is a constant amount of time,
if you stretch the sprites to the whole lenght of the area. You may stretch
only the first and last lines, stretch the other lines by a constant or
using a table, or using a variable table or any of the combinations possible.
