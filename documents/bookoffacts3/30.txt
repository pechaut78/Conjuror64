_How to open the sideborders_

The same trick can be applied to sideborders. When VIC is about to start
displaying the sideborder, just select 38-column mode and restore 40-column
mode so that you can do the trick again in the next scan line. If you need to
open the sideborders in the bottom or top border area, you have to open the
vertical borders also, but there shouldn't be any difficulty in doing that.

There is two drawbacks in this. The timing must be precise, one clock cycle
off and the sideborder will not open (the sprites will generally take care of
the timing) and you have to do the opening on each and every line. With
top/bottom borders once in a frame was enough.

Another problem is bad-lines. There is not enough time to open the borders
during a bad line and still have all of the sprites enabled. One solution
is to open the borders only on seven lines and leave the bad lines unopened.
Another way is to use less than eight sprites. You can have six of them
on a bad line and still be able to open the sideborders (PAL). The old and
still good solution is to scroll the bad lines, so that VIC will not start
to draw the screen at all until it is allowed to do so.
