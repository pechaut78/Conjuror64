"What is FLI and how does it affect processor time?","FLI (Flexible Line Interpretation) is a feature on the Commodore 64 that allows for hardware scrolling and raster effects. However, it consumes all available processor time, making it unsuitable for action games. This is because it requires a significant amount of processing power to handle the hardware scrolling and raster effects."
"How much memory does each FLI picture take?","Each FLI picture takes about 17 kB of memory. This means that not many pictures can fit on a single floppy disk, limiting the amount of FLI content that can be stored and used."
"What types of software are suitable for FLI?","FLI is best suited for demos, intros, board-type games, and possibly GIF viewers. These types of software typically do not require real-time interaction or quick response times, making them a good fit for FLI's limitations."
"What is the alternative to FLI for action games?","The alternative to FLI for action games is Copper. Copper is a part of the Commodore 64's video chip that can be used to create hardware scrolling and raster effects, but it does not consume as much processor time as FLI."
"Why is FLI not suitable for action games?","FLI is not suitable for action games because it consumes all available processor time, leaving no processing power for other game functions. This results in slow response times and poor gameplay experience."
"How does FLI affect memory usage?","FLI uses a significant amount of memory, with each picture taking up about 17 kB. This limits the amount of FLI content that can be stored and used."
"What are the advantages of using FLI in demos and intros?","FLI's hardware scrolling and raster effects make it a good fit for demos and intros. These types of software typically focus on visual effects and do not require real-time interaction or quick response times, making FLI a good fit."
"What is the impact of FLI on board-type games?","FLI can be used in board-type games, but the limited amount of memory available for FLI content means that there may be limitations on the number and complexity of the visual effects used in the game."
"What is the role of FLI in a GIF viewer?","FLI can be used in a GIF viewer to display the individual frames of the GIF. However, the limited amount of memory available for FLI content may result in limitations on the size and complexity of the GIFs that can be viewed."
"What are the trade-offs of using FLI in software development?","The trade-offs of using FLI in software development include the limited amount of memory available for FLI content, the impact on processor time, and the limitations on the types of software that are suitable for FLI. These trade-offs must be considered when deciding whether to use FLI in software development."
