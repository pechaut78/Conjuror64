_Save characters - and time_

But why should we move an eight-byte-high character image in a 48-line-high
area, when 16 is really enough ?  We can use two characters for the graphics
bitmap and then move this in eight pixel steps up and down. The lowest
three bits of the y-position then gives us the offset where the data must
be plotted inside this graphical region. The two character codes are usually
selected to be consecutive ones so that the image data has also 16
consecutive bytes. [See picture 1.]
