DYCP - Different Y Character Position - is a name for a horizontal scroller,
where characters go smoothly up and down during their voyage from right to
left. One possibility is a scroll with 8 characters - one character in each
sprite, but a real demo coder won't be satisfied with that.

Demo coders thought that it looks good to make the scrolling text change its
vertical position in the same time it proceeded from the right side of the
screen to the left. The only problem is that there is only eight sprites
and that is not even nearly enough to satisfy the requirements needed for
great look. So the only way is to use screen and somehow plot the text in
graphics, because character columns can not be scrolled individually.
Plotting the characters take absolutely too much time, because you have to
handle each byte seperately and the graphics bitmap must be cleared too.
