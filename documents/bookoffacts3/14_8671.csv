"What is the purpose of the GET Q(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic?","The GET Q(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic is used to scan the keyboard for a key to be typed. It waits for the user to press a key and then returns the ASCII code of the key that was pressed."
"What does the GET# NONE statement do in C64 Basic?","The GET# NONE statement in C64 Basic is an input/output statement that reads a character from a device or file. It can be used to read data from a variety of sources, such as a keyboard, a serial port, or a disk drive."
"What is the function of the GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement in C64 Basic?","The GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement in C64 Basic is used to jump to a routine within a program. It is typically used in conjunction with the RETURN statement, which is used to return control to the point immediately following the GOSUB statement."
"What is the purpose of the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic?","The GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is used to jump to a line within a program. It can be used to create loops or to jump to a specific point in a program."
"What is the syntax for the IF THEN NONE statement in C64 Basic?","The syntax for the IF THEN NONE statement in C64 Basic is as follows: IF <condition> THEN <statement(s)>. The condition is a logical expression that is evaluated to either true or false. If the condition is true, then the statement(s) following the THEN keyword are executed."
"What is an example of how the IF THEN NONE statement can be used in C64 Basic?","An example of how the IF THEN NONE statement can be used in C64 Basic is as follows: IF A$ = T THEN SYS64738. This example checks if the value of the string variable A$ is equal to the string "T". If it is, then the program jumps to the address 64738, which is typically the address of the warm start routine."
"What is the difference between the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) and GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statements in C64 Basic?","The GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is used to jump to a line within a program, while the GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement is used to jump to a routine within a program. The GOSUB statement is typically used in conjunction with the RETURN statement, which is used to return control to the point immediately following the GOSUB statement. The GOTO statement, on the other hand, simply jumps to a line within a program and does not return control to the point following the GOTO statement."
"Can the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement be used to jump to a label in a different program in C64 Basic?","No, the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic can only be used to jump to a line within the current program. It cannot be used to jump to a label in a different program."
"What is the purpose of the ASCII code returned by the GET Q(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic?","The ASCII code returned by the GET Q(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic is the numerical representation of the key that was pressed. It can be used to determine which key was pressed and to take appropriate action based on that information."
"What is the purpose of the NONE parameter in the GET# and IF THEN statements in C64 Basic?","The NONE parameter in the GET# and IF THEN statements in C64 Basic is a placeholder that indicates that no parameter is required for these statements. It is used to distinguish these statements from other statements that have a similar syntax but require a parameter."
