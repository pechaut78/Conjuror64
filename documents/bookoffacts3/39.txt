_A raster routine is a must_

Because you have to access the VIC registers on each line during the stretch,
you need some kind of routine which can do other kinds of tricks besides the
stretch. You can open the side borders and change the background color and
maybe you have to shift the screen (and the bad lines with it) downwards.
[See previous C=Hacking Issues for talk about raster interrupts.]

Look at the demo program. In the beginning of the raster routine there is
first some timing, then a loop that lasts exactly 46 clock cycles. It takes
exactly one scan line to execute. Inside the loop we first do the necassary
modifications to the vertical scroll register, then we change the background
color and then we open the side borders. And finally we handle the stretching
using the stretch data, where a zero-bit means that the corresponding sprite
will be stretched. A one-bit means that VIC is allowed to go to the next line
of the sprite data.
