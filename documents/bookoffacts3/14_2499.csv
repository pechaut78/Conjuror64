"What is the purpose of the GET Q(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic?","The GET Q(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic is used to scan the keyboard for a key to be typed. It waits for the user to press a key before continuing."
"What is the function of the GET# NONE statement in C64 Basic?","The GET# NONE statement in C64 Basic is an input/output statement that is used to input a character from a device or file. It reads a single character from a specified input channel."
"What is the use of the GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement in C64 Basic?","The GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement in C64 Basic is used to jump to a routine within a program. It is used in conjunction with the RETURN statement to create subroutines within a program."
"What is the function of the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic?","The GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is used to jump to a line within a program. It causes the program to immediately continue execution at the specified line number."
"Can you provide an example of how the IF THEN NONE statement is used in C64 Basic?","An example of how the IF THEN NONE statement is used in C64 Basic is: IF A$ = T THEN SYS64738. This statement checks if the value of the string variable A$ is equal to the string T. If it is, then the program jumps to the address stored in the SYS variable, which is typically the start of the program."
"What is the purpose of the input/output statement GET# NONE in C64 Basic?","The input/output statement GET# NONE in C64 Basic is used to input a character from a device or file. It reads a single character from a specified input channel and stores it in the accumulator."
"What is the use of the GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement in C64 Basic and how is it related to the RETURN statement?","The GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement in C64 Basic is used to jump to a routine within a program. It is used in conjunction with the RETURN statement to create subroutines within a program. When the RETURN statement is encountered, the program jumps back to the statement immediately following the GOSUB statement."
"What is the function of the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic and how is it different from the GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement?","The GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is used to jump to a line within a program, while the GOSUB GO(SHIFT S) statement is used to jump to a routine within a program. The GOTO statement causes the program to immediately continue execution at the specified line number, while the GOSUB statement jumps to a routine and waits for the RETURN statement to return control to the next statement in the program."
"Can you provide an example of how the GET# NONE statement is used in C64 Basic to input a character from a file?","An example of how the GET# NONE statement is used in C64 Basic to input a character from a file is: GET#1, A$. This statement reads a single character from the file associated with input channel 1 and stores it in the string variable A$."
"What is the purpose of the IF THEN NONE statement in C64 Basic and how does it differ from the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement?","The IF THEN NONE statement in C64 Basic is used to set up a conditional branch, while the GOTO G(SHIFTED O) statement is used to jump to a line within a program. The IF THEN NONE statement checks a condition and only executes the following statement if the condition is true, while the GOTO statement always jumps to the specified line number regardless of the current state of the program."
