_Stretch the sprites_

The easiest way is to position all of the sprites where the scroll will
be when it is in its highest position. Then stretch the first and last line
of each sprite so that the 19 sprite lines in the middle will be on the
desired place. Opening the borders now is trivial, because all of the sprites
are present on all of the scan lines and they steal a constant amount of
time. However, we lose two sprite lines. We might not want to use the first
and the last line for graphics, because they are stretched.
[See previous C=Hacking Issues for more information about stretching and
 stolen cycles.]

A more difficult approach is to unroll the routine and let another routine
count the sprites present in each line and then change the time the routine
uses accordingly. In this way you save time during the display for other
effects, like color bars, because stretching will take at least 12 cycles
on each raster line. On the other hand, if the sinus is constant (user is
not allowed to change it), it is usually possible to embedd the count
routine directly to the border opening part of the routine.
