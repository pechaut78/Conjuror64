_Not much time_

Because a bad line will steal 40 cycles, there is only 23 cycles left on
each scan line. It is enough for changing the video matrix and backgroud
color. There is not a moment to lose, because you must change the vertical
scroll register, video matrix pointer and the background color. This is why
you can't have sprites in front of a FLI picture.

With FLI we get two selectable colors for each character position and line,
each scan line can have it's own background color and each character position
still has its own character color from color memory. In theory each character
position could have 25 different colors, unfortunately VIC only has 16.
