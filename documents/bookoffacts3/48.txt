_More movement vertically_

You might think that using the sprites will restrict the sinus to only
14 pixels. Not really, the only restriction is that the vertical position
difference between three consequent text character must be less than 14
pixel lines. Each sprites' Y-coordinate will be the minimum of the three
characters residing in that sprite. Line offsets inside the sprites
are then obtained by subtracting the sprite y-coordinate from the character
y-coordinate. Maybe a little hard to follow, but maybe a picture will
clear the situation. [See picture 2.]

Scrolling horizontally is easy. You just have to move sprites like you would
use the character horizontal scroll register and after eight pixels you
reset the sprite positions and scroll the text one position in memory.
And of course, you fetch a new character for the scroll. When we have
different and changing sprite y-coordinates, opening the side borders become
a great deal more difficult. However, in this case there is at least two
different ways to do it.
