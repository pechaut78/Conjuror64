  You might have heard that it is possible to expand sprites to more than
twice their original size. Imagine a sprite scroller with 6-times expanded
sprites. However, there is no need to expand all of them equally. Using
this technique, it is possible to make easy sinus effects and constantly
expanding and shrinking letters.

The VIC (video interface controller) may be fooled in many things. One of
them is the vertical expansion of sprites. If you clear the expand flag and
then set it back straight away, VIC will think it has only displayed the
first one of the expanded lines. If we do the trick again, VIC will continue
to display the same data again and again. But why does VIC behave like this ?
