"What register does VIC use to determine bad lines when drawing the screen?","VIC determines bad lines by comparing its scan line counter to the vertical scroll register ($d011). When the scan line counter matches the value in the vertical scroll register, the next line is considered a bad line."
"What happens if the vertical scroll register is changed on every line?","If the vertical scroll register is changed on every line, the line counter in VIC will never match with it, and the drawing of the screen will not start until it is allowed to do so."
"What is not necessary to get rid of bad lines?","It is not necessary to change the vertical scroll on every line to get rid of bad lines. It is sufficient to ensure that the vertical scroll never matches the least significant 3 bits of the line counter."
"What can be done with FLD (Flexible Line Distance)?","With FLD, bad lines can be allowed when it is time to display the next character row. This allows for effects such as bouncing the lines or scrolling a hires picture quickly down the screen."
"How does VIC determine the first bad line?","VIC begins to draw the screen from the first bad line. VIC determines what line is a bad line by comparing its scan line counter to the vertical scroll register. When they match, the next line is considered a bad line."
"What happens when the vertical scroll register is changed while scrolling the screen?","Changing the vertical scroll register while scrolling the screen causes the first bad line to move. This can be used to create various scrolling effects."
"What is the purpose of the vertical scroll register in VIC?","The vertical scroll register in VIC is used to determine bad lines when drawing the screen. By changing this register, the position of the first bad line can be controlled, allowing for various scrolling effects."
"What are bad lines in the context of VIC and screen drawing?","Bad lines are lines that VIC considers when drawing the screen. These lines are determined by comparing the scan line counter to the vertical scroll register. When they match, the next line is considered a bad line."
"What is required to open the borders and do other effects while scrolling the screen?","When there are no bad lines to worry about, there is enough time to open the borders and do other effects. This can be achieved by ensuring that the vertical scroll never matches the least significant 3 bits of the line counter."
"What is FLD (Flexible Line Distance) in the context of VIC and screen drawing?","FLD (Flexible Line Distance) is a technique that allows bad lines to be scrolled independently. This can be used to create effects such as bouncing the lines or scrolling a hires picture quickly down the screen."
