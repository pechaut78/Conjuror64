It can be used in a PRINT statement to display the current time. For example, the following code will display the time after a loop has executed 10000 times: FOR T = 1 TO 10000: NEXT T:PRINT TI$. The TIME$ command will return a string in the format "000010" after the loop has executed 10000 times."
"What is the purpose of the USR command in C64 Basic and how is it used to access a user callable machine language routine?","The USR command in C64 Basic is used to access a user callable machine language routine. To use the USR command, you need to set the memory locations 785 and 786 to contain the pointers for the start of the machine language routine. The USR command then takes a single argument, which is the address of the machine language routine. For example, USR U(SHIFTED S) will call the machine language routine starting at the address stored in memory locations 785 and 786."
