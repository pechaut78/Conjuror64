VALIDATE A DISK:
OPEN15,8,15,"V" (press return key)
EXPLANATION - When a disk has been used over a period of time, the
directory can become disorganized. Usually this is caused by repeated
saving and scratching of files. This usually results in one or more
blocks on the disk that cannot be used because they are too small. The
validate command will reorganize the disk to make the most out of the
space that is available.
