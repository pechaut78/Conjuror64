"What is the purpose of the DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic?","The DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement in C64 Basic is used to create a user-defined function with a single parameter E, which can be shifted. This function can be used as a substitute for any expression in the program."
"How do you define the maximum range of an array or group of variables in C64 Basic?","The DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement is used to define the maximum range of an array or group of variables in C64 Basic. The statement defines the number of elements in the array or group, which can be up to 10 dimensions and each dimension can have up to 65536 elements."
"What does the END E(SHIFTED N) statement do in C64 Basic?","The END E(SHIFTED N) statement in C64 Basic is used to stop a program from executing. It is typically placed at the end of the program to indicate that the program has finished running."
"What is the EXP E(SHIFTED X) mathematical function in C64 Basic used for?","The EXP E(SHIFTED X) mathematical function in C64 Basic is used to calculate the exponential value of a number. It returns the value e (the base of natural logarithms) raised to the power of the value of the expression X."
"What is the purpose of the FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic?","The FOR F(SHIFTED O) statement in C64 Basic is used to set up a variable as a counter in a for next loop. It is used to repeat a block of code a specific number of times."
"How do you find out the amount of free memory in C64 Basic?","The FRE F(SHIFTED R) statement is used to find out the amount of free memory in C64 Basic. It returns the number of bytes available for use in the program."
"What is a user-defined function in C64 Basic?","A user-defined function in C64 Basic is a function that is created by the user using the DEF FN D(SHIFTED E) statement. It can be used as a substitute for any expression in the program and can have a single parameter that can be shifted."
"What is the purpose of the DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement in C64 Basic?","The DIM D(SHIFTED I) statement in C64 Basic is used to define the maximum range of an array or group of variables. It defines the number of elements in the array or group, which can be up to 10 dimensions and each dimension can have up to 65536 elements."
"What is the syntax for a for next loop in C64 Basic?","The syntax for a for next loop in C64 Basic is: FOR F(SHIFTED O) variable = start TO end STEP increment : block of code : NEXT variable. The variable is set as a counter and the block of code is repeated a specific number of times."
"What does the FRE F(SHIFTED R) statement return in C64 Basic?","The FRE F(SHIFTED R) statement in C64 Basic returns the number of bytes available for use in the program. It is used to find out the amount of free memory in the program."
