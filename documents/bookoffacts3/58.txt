_What to do with FLI ?_

Because FLI will eat up all the available processor time (no Copper :-),
it is not suitable for any action-games. Each FLI picture takes about 17 kB
of memory: not so many pictures fit on one floppy. So, the only place for FLI
is demos, intros, board-type games and maybe a GIF viewer..
