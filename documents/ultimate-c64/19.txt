Character Mode
The C64 has two built-in character sets that the VIC
can access. They can be shown on the screen by writing the numbers 0 to 255 into screen RAM (at $0400
by default). The default font has uppercase characters
and lots of line-drawing symbols in the lower 128
characters, and the second half consists of the same
characters, but inverse. The alternative font has upper- and lowercase characters and omits some of the
symbols.
The foreground color of the characters can be
changed by writing the color numbers into the Color
RAM, which is located at $D800-$DBFF. There is
one byte per character, but only the lower 4 bits are
actually preserved by Color RAM.
Each character is 8x8 pixels, and stored as eight bytes
in the character ROM, one line being one byte. A 1-bit
will take the color from the Color RAM ($D800-
$DBFF), and a 0 bit will take it from the global background color register ($D021). The pixel matrix is
determined by looking up the character index in the
screen RAM (at $0400-$07FF by default) and consequently looking up the pattern the current character
set (the VIC sees the default font at $1000, although
for the 6502 it is invisible there).
In Extended Color Mode (ECM), it is possible to
chose between one of four background colors (registers $D021 to $D024) with the upper two bits of the
character index, but then only 6 bits will be used to
look up the character pattern, decreasing the number
of possible characters to 64. The built-in (uppercase)
character set is well-suited for this: While it is similar
to the ASCII encoding, it has the uppercase characters
mapped to codes $01 to $1A, so the most important
characters are within the first $40.
Multi-Color Character Mode allows up to four colors
per character and is intended for tile-based games,
like platformers. If bit 3 of the value in Color RAM is
0, then the character gets displayed just like in nonmulticolor mode, but colors are restricted to the first
eight. If bit 3 is 1, then pairs of horizontally adjacent
bits are combined in their meaning: 00 represents the
screen background ($D021), 01 is the second background register ($D022), 10 is the third background
register ($D023), and 11 is the color specified in bits
0-2 of the Color RAM. Pixels in these characters are
twice as wide, so the resolution of a character is 4x8.
