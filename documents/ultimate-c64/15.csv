question,answer
"Where is the I/O library located in the C64?","The I/O library is located at $E000-$FFFF in the C64."
"What is the purpose of the jump tables in Commodore 8-bit systems?","The jump tables are used to call into machine-specific functions for I/O."
"What is the function of KERNAL when it is started from the RESET vector?","KERNAL initializes the machine, sets up an interrupt service routine that handles the keyboard, animates the cursor, and does the real time clock."
"What is the abstract interface provided by KERNAL to devices?","KERNAL provides an abstract character I/O interface to devices."
"What are the four operations supported by all devices in KERNAL?","All devices support open, read, write, and close operations."
"What is the maximum number of channels supported by KERNAL?","The maximum number of channels supported by KERNAL is 16."
"What is the purpose of the secondary address in KERNAL?","The secondary address can signal something to the device, like speed or an operation mode."
"What is device 0 in KERNAL?","Device 0 is the keyboard."
"How can the keyboard be accessed in KERNAL?","The keyboard can be accessed through raw key presses or through character I/O, which goes through the screen editor."
"What is device 1 in KERNAL?","Device 1 is the tape drive."
"How does KERNAL read and write data to the tape drive?","KERNAL reads and writes blocks of data at a time and buffers them for character I/O."
"What is device 2 in KERNAL?","Device 2 is RS-232."
"What is the maximum baud rate supported by KERNAL's software RS-232 implementation?","The maximum baud rate supported is 2400 baud."
"What is device 3 in KERNAL?","Device 3 is the screen."
"What does KERNAL do to the screen?","KERNAL interprets special codes, manages the cursor position, and handles scrolling."
"What devices are directed to the IEC bus in KERNAL?","Devices 4 to 15 are directed to the IEC bus."
"What are devices 4 to 7 typically used for in KERNAL?","Devices 4 to 7 are typically used for printers and plotters."
"What are devices 8 to 15 typically used for in KERNAL?","Devices 8 to 15 are typically used for floppy or hard disks."
"How can the IEC bus be interacted with manually in KERNAL?","The IEC bus can be interacted with manually by sending TALK and LISTEN requests to the bus."
"What is the purpose of the CIA chips in the C64?","The CIA chips have a hardware clock, but KERNAL has not been updated to use this feature since the VIC-20."
"What is the function of the interrupt service routine set up by KERNAL?","The interrupt service routine handles the keyboard, animates the cursor, and does the real time clock."
"What is the significance of the top of memory in Commodore 8-bit systems?","The top of memory contains jump tables that call into machine-specific functions for I/O."
