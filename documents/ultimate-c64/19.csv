"what is the default font of the C64 character set","The default font has uppercase characters and lots of line-drawing symbols in the lower 128 characters, and the second half consists of the same characters, but inverse."
"what is the location of the screen RAM","The screen RAM is located at $0400 by default."
"what is the size of each character in pixels","Each character is 8x8 pixels."
"how are characters stored in the character ROM","Characters are stored as eight bytes in the character ROM, one line being one byte."
"what determines the pixel matrix of a character","The pixel matrix is determined by looking up the character index in the screen RAM and consequently looking up the pattern the current character set."
"what is the function of the Color RAM","The Color RAM determines the foreground color of the characters."
"what is the location of the Color RAM","The Color RAM is located at $D800-$DBFF."
"how many bits of the Color RAM are preserved","Only the lower 4 bits of the Color RAM are actually preserved."
"in Extended Color Mode, how many background colors can be chosen","In Extended Color Mode, one of four background colors can be chosen with the upper two bits of the character index."
"what is the limitation of Extended Color Mode","In Extended Color Mode, only 6 bits will be used to look up the character pattern, decreasing the number of possible characters to 64."
"what is the purpose of Multi-Color Character Mode","Multi-Color Character Mode is intended for tile-based games, like platformers."
"how many colors per character are allowed in Multi-Color Character Mode","Up to four colors per character are allowed in Multi-Color Character Mode."
"what happens when bit 3 of the value in Color RAM is 0","If bit 3 of the value in Color RAM is 0, then the character gets displayed just like in non-multicolor mode, but colors are restricted to the first eight."
"what happens when bit 3 of the value in Color RAM is 1","If bit 3 of the value in Color RAM is 1, then pairs of horizontally adjacent bits are combined in their meaning."
"what is the resolution of a character in Multi-Color Character Mode","The resolution of a character in Multi-Color Character Mode is 4x8."
"what is the location of the alternative font","The alternative font has upper- and lowercase characters and omits some of the symbols."
"what is the location of the VIC character set","The VIC sees the default font at $1000, although for the 6502 it is invisible there."

"what is the location of the global background color register","The global background color register is located at $D021."
"what is the function of the character index","The character index is used to look up the pattern of the current character set."
"what is the size of the character ROM","The character ROM stores each character as eight bytes, one line being one byte."
"what is the purpose of the screen RAM","The screen RAM stores the character index and determines the pixel matrix of a character."
"what is the location of the second background register","The second background register is located at $D022."
"what is the location of the third background register","The third background register is located at $D023."
"what is the purpose of the Color RAM in Multi-Color Character Mode","In Multi-Color Character Mode, the Color RAM specifies the color of each pixel in a character."
"what is the limitation of the built-in character set in Extended Color Mode","The built-in character set is well-suited for Extended Color Mode, but it has the uppercase characters mapped to codes $01 to $1A, so the most important characters are within the first $40."
