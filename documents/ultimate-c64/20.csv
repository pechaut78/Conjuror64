question,answer
"What is the resolution of hi-res graphics mode in the VIC?","The resolution of hi-res graphics mode in the VIC is 320x200, which uses the same pixel frequency as 40x25 character mode."
"What is the location of the bitmap in hi-res mode?","The bitmap can reside at $0000 or $2000, and the VIC reads one byte for 8 pixels."
"How are the foreground and background colors of each 8x8 tile determined in hi-res mode?","The foreground and background colors of each 8x8 tile are taken from the high and low nibble of screen RAM, which would otherwise be unused."
"What is the encoding of the bitmap in hi-res mode?","The encoding of the bitmap is identical to the encoding of a character set, making it a non-linear framebuffer."
"How does the bitmap layout affect pixel addressing in software?","The layout makes pixel addressing in software slower."
"What is the horizontal resolution in Multi-Color Bitmap Mode?","The horizontal resolution is halved to 160x200, and pixels are twice the width."
"How are colors encoded in Multi-Color Bitmap Mode?","Every set of two bits in the encodes one of four colors per tile: 00 takes it from the global background register ($D021), 01 and 10 take it from the upper and lower nibble of screen RAM, respectively, and 11 takes it from Color RAM."
"What is the purpose of the high and low nibble of screen RAM in hi-res mode?","The high and low nibble of screen RAM are used to determine the foreground and background colors of each 8x8 tile."
"Is Color RAM used in hi-res mode?","No, Color RAM is not used in hi-res mode."
"What is the size of each pixel in Multi-Color Bitmap Mode?","Pixels are twice the width in Multi-Color Bitmap Mode."
