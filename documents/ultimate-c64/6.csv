"what is the purpose of the immediate addressing mode?","The immediate addressing mode is indicated with a # sign and loads the immediate value into the accumulator, for example LDA #$17 loads the value $17 into the accumulator."
"what is the difference between absolute and zero page addressing?","Absolute addressing specifies a 16 bit address as an operand, whereas zero page addressing is an optimized version of absolute addressing, where the instruction can be encoded more tightly and execution is faster, and it reads from a specific address in the zero page."
"how does absolute-x-indexed addressing work?","Absolute-X-indexed addressing reads from a specified address, to which the contents of the X register is added, for example LDA $0200,X reads from the address $020A, if X is $0A."
"what is the purpose of zero-page-x-indexed addressing?","Zero-Page-X-indexed addressing is an optimized version of Absolute-X-indexed addressing, it reads from the Xth location in a table stored in the zero page, for example LDA $F0,X reads from the Xth location in a table stored starting at $00F0 in memory."
"how does zero-page-x-indexed-indirect addressing work?","Zero-Page-X-indexed-indirect adds X to a specified zero page address, reads a 16 bit pointer from the resulting address and finally accesses memory at that address, for example LDA ($80,X) will read from an address specified by the array of pointers at $0080 and the index X into the array."
"what is the purpose of absolute-y-indexed addressing?","Absolute-Y-indexed addressing is the same as Absolute-X-indexed addressing, but with the Y register, it reads from a specified address, to which the contents of the Y register is added."
"how does zero-page-y-indexed addressing work?","Zero-Page-Y-indexed addressing is the same as Zero-Page-X-indexed addressing, but with the Y register, it reads from the Yth location in a table stored in the zero page."
"what is the purpose of zero-page-indirect-y-indexed addressing?","Zero-Page-indirect-Y-indexed addressing treats two consecutive bytes in zero page as an address and adds Y to the address, it is the most convenient way to work with pointers, as no register can hold 16 bits."
"what is the difference between absolute and zero page addressing modes?","Absolute addressing specifies a 16 bit address as an operand, whereas zero page addressing is an optimized version of absolute addressing, where the instruction can be encoded more tightly and execution is faster, and it reads from a specific address in the zero page."
"how does immediate addressing mode differ from other addressing modes?","Immediate addressing mode is indicated with a # sign and loads the immediate value into the accumulator, whereas other addressing modes specify a memory address to read from."
