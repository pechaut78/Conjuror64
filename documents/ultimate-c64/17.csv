"What is connected to CIA 1?","CIA 1 is hooked up to the keyboard and the joystick ports."
"What is connected to CIA 2?","CIA 2 is hooked up to the IEC bus, and I/O lines control the VIC bank."
"How does KERNAL use CIA 1?","KERNAL uses CIA 1 for the 50 Hz system timer, but, apart from the ports, doesn't use any of the extra features of either CIA."
"What is exposed on the user port?","The rest is exposed on the user port, and can be used for RS-232."
