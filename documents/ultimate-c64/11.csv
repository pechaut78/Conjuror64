"What is the purpose of the BIT instruction in 6502 assembly language?","The BIT instruction exists in a two-byte and three-byte variant, and since it only changes the flags, it effectively skips one or two bytes in the instruction stream, which can be used to replace a two-byte branch or a three-byte JMP with a one-byte BIT if only one or two bytes have to be skipped."
"How can self-modifying code be optimized in 6502 assembly language?","The architecture allows safe self-modifying code, so a common optimization for copy loops is to use LDA $nn00,X and STA $mm00,X, looping X from $00 to $FF and then incrementing the bytes that encode nn and mm for the next page."
"What is the advantage of using LDA $nn00,X and STA $mm00,X in copy loops?","Compared to a LDA (zp1),Y: STA (zp2),Y sequence, this gets the inner loop down from 16 cycles to 14 cycles."
"Why should PHA/PLA combinations be avoided in 6502 assembly language?","A PHA/PLA combination is 7 cycles, while an STA/LDA combination in the zero page is 6 cycles, so unless there is no free zero page space, PHA/PLA should be avoided to quickly store a value."
"How can a flag be elegantly stored in 6502 assembly language?","An elegant way to store a flag is to have it in bit #7 of a zero page address, while a load/store combination has to be used to set the flag, it can be cleared with a simple LSR and tested with BIT, without affecting register contents."
"What is a limitation of the 6502 processor?","The 6502 is so register starved, only 3 bytes can be passed to a subroutine in registers."
"Why are stack frames uncommon in 6502 assembly language?","The stack is small, and accessing it is slow, so stack frames as seen on modern architectures are very uncommon."
"How do some applications and libraries handle the limitation of registers in 6502 assembly language?","Many applications and libraries use a dedicated area in the zero page as virtual registers."
"What mathematical operations are not supported by the 6502 processor?","The 6502 has no instructions for multiplication, division or floating point arithmetic."
"How do 6502-based computers typically provide mathematical operations?","Most 6502-based computers have a BASIC interpreter in ROM though, and they typically include a math and floating point library."
