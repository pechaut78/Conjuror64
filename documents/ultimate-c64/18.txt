6567/6569 VIC
The video chip inside the C64 is called the MOS
6567/6569 VIC-II (Video Interface Controller) - the
video chip in the VIC-20 had been the original VIC,
and was the reason for the marketing name of the
VIC-20.
The VIC supports a 40x25 text mode, a 320x200 bitmap mode, 16 colors and 8 sprites - all of these features have lots of sub-modes and options. The
amount of memory the VIC can address is 16 KB, and
while by default, it accesses the first 16 KB of the C64
RAM, it can be configured to use any of the four
banks.
The 16 colors of the VIC are divided into two sets of
eight. The first eight are the more important colors,
as some modes only support the first eight. The colors
are, in the original order: black, white, red, cyan, purple, green, blue, yellow, orange, brown, pink, dark
gray, gray, light green, light blue and light gray.
