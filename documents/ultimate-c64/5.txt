Instruction Set
The instruction set is very streamlined, and avoid
redundancies. There are load instructions (LDA/
LDX/LDY to load A, X and Y respecively), store instructions (STA/STX/STY), read-modify-write instructions (logic: ASL/LSR/ROL/ROR, count: INC/
DEC), arithmetic (ADC/SBC; note that these always
include the carry: CLC/ADC is a regular addition, and
SEC/SBC is a regular subtraction, because of the
one's complement logic), compare (CMP/CPX/CPY;
these are subtractions without storing the result),
logic (AND/ORA/EOR, and BIT, which is AND without storing the result), as well as branch instructions,
flag manipulation, register transfer and stack manipulation.
