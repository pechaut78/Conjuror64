question,answer
"What is the clock speed of the MOS 6510 CPU in a Commodore 64?","0.985 MHz"
"What company formed in 1975 introduced the 6502 CPU?","MOS Technology"
"What is the philosophy behind the design of the 6502 CPU?","To have a reduced instruction set and a small register file, making it simpler and faster than CPUs like the Z80 at the same clock speed, as well as cheaper to manufacture."
"What type of registers does the 6502 CPU have instead of general purpose registers?","A single accumulator A, two index registers X and Y, and a stack pointer."
"What is the width of the program counter (PC) in the 6502 CPU?","16 bits"
"What is the range of the stack in the 6502 CPU's address space?","Between $0100 and $01FF"
"What is the special area in the address space referred to as?","The zero page (ZP)"
"What is the advantage of using zero page addresses in the 6502 CPU?","It saves one byte in the instruction encoding as well as at least one cycle of execution time."
"How many bytes are the opcodes in the 6502 CPU?","One byte"
"What is the characteristic of the opcode table in the 6502 CPU?","A minimal encoding for optimal decoding in the 6502's internal PLA ROM."
