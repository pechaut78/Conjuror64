Memory Configuration
In a running system with BASIC and KERNAL, the
BASIC and KERNAL ROMs are turned on and visible
at $A000-$BFFF and $E000-$FFFF respectively,
and at $D000-$DFFF, the I/O area is visible. Using
the 3 lowest bits in the processor port at address 1,
this configuration can be altered. The ROMs can be
turned off, revealing RAM instead, and the I/O area
can be configured to show either RAM or the character set ROM. Note that writing to ROM will always
direct the data to the underlying RAM.
In practice, many programs run in the default configuration and use both KERNAL library routines, as
well as functions in BASIC, to keep their own code as
small as possible. More recent programs and almost
all games turn off all of ROM, to get direct control of
the interrupt vector without having to go though the
KERNAL handler first. The I/O area is typically configured to show the I/O registers and Color RAM, and
only rarely switched to a different configuration to
temporarily access the RAM underneath. A few applications read the character ROM at program start and
modify the copy.
The C64 supports another ROM bank at $8000-
$9FFF, which can only be serviced by an external cartridge connected to the expansion port. If KERNAL
detects the magic string ”CBM80” at $8004 on
startup, it will jump to the code of the cartridge right
away.
