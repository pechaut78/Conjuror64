"what is the purpose of the JSR instruction?","JSR (jump to subroutine) only has an absolute version, and stores the address of the next instruction minus one on the stack."
"what happens when a hardware interrupt occurs?","A hardware interrupt, unless disabled by a set interrupt (I) flag, pushes the address of the next instruction minus one, pushes the processor status afterwards, disables interrupts, and jumps over the vector at $FFFE/$FFFF."
"what is the difference between a hardware interrupt and a software interrupt?","BRK causes a software interrupt and behaves the same as a hardware interrupt, except that it sets the B flag on the stack to 1 (a hardware interrupt sets it to 0)"
"what is the purpose of the RTS instruction?","RTS (return from subroutine) takes the address from the stack, adds one, and moves it into the program counter."
"what is the purpose of the RTI instruction?","RTI return from interrupt) is the same as the combination of PLP and RTS."
"what is the purpose of the JMP instruction?","Next to the absolute JMP instruction, there is an indirect version that jumps over a vector (e.g. JMP ($FFFC))."
"what is the purpose of the BRK instruction?","BRK causes a software interrupt and behaves the same as a hardware interrupt, except that it sets the B flag on the stack to 1 (a hardware interrupt sets it to 0)"
"what is the purpose of the NMI interrupt?","NMIs behave the same as IRQs, but they cannot be masked, and they use the $FFFA/$FFFB vector."
"what is the purpose of the reset vector?","The reset vector is at $FFFC/$FFFD."
"what is the reason for the 'minus one' logic in JSR?","The ”minus one” logic was chosen because it could save one cycle in the implementation of JSR."
