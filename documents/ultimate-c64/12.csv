"what is the bug in the indirect version of JMP in the original 6502 implementation","The indirect version of JMP loads the program counter from the wrong address, if the vector's address lies on a page boundary: JMP ($23FF) will read the address from $23FF and $2300 instead of $23FF and $2400."
"in decimal mode, what does the negative flag reflect","The negative flag reflects the original binary result, not the effective decimal result."
"what happens when a software interrupt and a hardware interrupt occur at the same time","The BRK is dropped."
"what happens when using read instructions with absolute-indexed addressing mode","The instructions first read from the absolute address without the index register added, and then read again from the correct address."
"what is the effect of read-modify-write instructions with absolute addresses","The instructions first read the value, but one cycle before they store the result, they store the original value again."
"what is the effect of incrementing the screen border color on a C64","Every write to the register will cause a tiny gray dot on the screen."
"how is instruction decoding done in the 6502","Instruction decoding in the 6502 is done by a PLA that compares the current cycle number within the instruction and the current opcode against a ROM of 130 mask lines, of which any number can fire independently."
"how many defined opcodes are there in the 6502 instruction set","The instruction set only consists of 151 defined opcodes."
"what happens to the remaining 105 opcodes","They will match against some lines that were meant for instructions with similar opcodes."
"what are some of the effects of using illegal opcodes","Some of these ”illegal opcodes” lead to useful results and are used in some software, but most of the instructions make little sense, and some even lock up the CPU, disabling IRQs and NMIs."
"what is the effect of using the SAX opcode","The SAX opcode stores A & X."
"what is the effect of using the SHX opcode","The SHX opcode stores X & the upper 8 bits of the program counter."
"what is the effect of using the CRA/KIL opcode","The CRA/KIL opcode locks up the CPU, disabling IRQs and NMIs."
"what is the purpose of the 65CE02 chip","The 65CE02 chip was only used in Amiga peripherals."
"what is the difference between the 65CE02 and other MOS chips","The 65CE02 chip has fixed some bugs and quirks that are present in other MOS chips."
"what is the effect of using the BRK instruction","The BRK instruction can be dropped if a hardware interrupt occurs at the same time."
"what is the purpose of the PLA in the 6502","The PLA compares the current cycle number within the instruction and the current opcode against a ROM of 130 mask lines."
"what is the effect of using the LDX instruction with absolute-indexed addressing mode","The LDX instruction first reads from the absolute address without the index register added, and then reads again from the correct address."
"what is the effect of using the LDA instruction with absolute-indexed addressing mode","The LDA instruction first reads from the absolute address without the index register added, and then reads from the correct address."
"what is the effect of using the LDA instruction on a C64","The LDA instruction can ACK all pending VIC interrupts on a C64."
"what is the effect of using the LDA instruction on a C64 with absolute-indexed addressing mode","The LDA instruction can ACK all pending VIC interrupts and then read from the correct address on a C64."
"what is the purpose of the ALU in the 6502","The ALU is one of the components that the outputs of the PLA lines are fed into."
"what is the purpose of the bus control in the 6502","The bus control is one of the components that the outputs of the PLA lines are fed into."
"what is the purpose of the register control in the 6502","The register control is one of the components that the outputs of the PLA lines are fed into."
"what is the purpose of the program counter logic in the 6502","The program counter logic is one of the components that the outputs of the PLA lines are fed into."
"what is the effect of using read-modify-write instructions with absolute addresses on a C64","Every write to the register will cause a tiny gray dot on the screen on a C64."
"what is the effect of using read-modify-write instructions with absolute addresses on certain I/O ports","This can have other side effects on certain I/O ports."
"what is the purpose of the PLA in the 6502 instruction decoding","The PLA compares the current cycle number within the instruction and the current opcode against a ROM of 130 mask lines."
