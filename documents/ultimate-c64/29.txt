The 1541 is the necessary companion to a C64. It can
be replaced by a 1570 (1541 with fast bus routines for
the C128) or a 1571 (double-sided 1570), since they
include a 1541 compatibility mode. The 3.5" Commodore 1581, which supports 880 KB per disk, can
hardly be a replacement for a 1541, because most applications contain their own floppy speeders that
make lots of assumptions on the exact on-disk format. For GEOS, it can be very useful though.
Creative Micro Devices sold and continues to sell a
line of hard drives that have an IEC connection but
contain a 3.5" SCSI drive inside. Although they have a
6502 CPU built in and allow code execution on their
CPU, they are not compatible enough to replace a
1541 either.
Several memory extension cartridges exist for the
expansion port of the C64: The Commodore REU
(contains a DMA chip that transfers data between
itself and main RAM), as well as the third party
GeoRAM (maps a block to the $DE00-$DFFF area)
and RAMLink (battery backed, designed as RAM
disk).
Freezer cartridges like the Action Replay and the Final Cartridge were not only popular because they
could dump all of memory to disk and thus copy certain copy-protected games, but also because they featured floppy speeders that disabled the original routines directly at startup time, without any effort from
the user.
In the mid 90s, CPU speeders for the expansion port
became popular. The 8 MHz Flash 8 is rare today, but
many enthusiasts have a SuperCPU, which replaces
the onboard CPU with a 20 MHz 65C816, which has a
native 16 bit mode that can address up to 16 MB or
RAM. There are a few applications and games that
require a SuperCPU. The speedup of GEOS with a
SuperCPU is significant.
In the 2000s, the enthusiast scene created all kinds of
peripherals, like ethernet interfaces, IDE interfaces
and SD card readers.
And there are not only peripherals: In 2004, the
Commodore 64 DTV, a reimplemented C64 appeared
in the form of a Joystick. The device is fairly compatible and can be extended to connect to a keyboard and
a 1541.
