Register Transfer and Stack
There are several 1 byte instructions without operands that move data between registers. TAX, TXA,
TAY and TYA move between A, X and Y. TSX and
TXS copies between X and the stack pointer.
The stack pointer always points to the next address
that is written to. This means that an empty stack has
a stack pointer of $FF, and pushing a value first
writes the value and then decrements the stack
pointer. The 6502 can move the accumulator from
and to the stack (PHA/PLA), as well as the processor
status P (PHP/PLP).
