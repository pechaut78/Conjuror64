Tape Interface
The tape interface consists of a single line each for
data input and output, motor control and key sense.
The raw data is read from and written to the data
lines, and all encoding and decoding of the data
stream is done in software. 3 of the required lines are
connected to the processor port at zero page location
1, and one (data input) is connected to CIA 2.
