1541 Disk Drive
The Commodore 1541 Disk Drive is the most common
disk drive used with the C64. It uses 5.25'' SS/DD
(single side, double density) disks, but disks can be
flipped, and the other side can be used as well, if the
disks are double sided. The 1541 does not use the index hole, and uses software markers (SYNC) instead
to be able to tell the start of a sector. Due to reliability
problems of early drives, the 1541 only uses 35 out of
the 40 possible tracks on a 5.25" disk. The tracks have
a variable number of 256 byte sectors, ranging from
21 on the outside to 17 on the inside. The data is written in 4 different speeds. This makes an overall 683
sectors, or 174,848 bytes.
The file system is stored on track 18. Track 18, sector
0 contains the disk name and the BAM (block availability map), which stores one bit per sector (1 = free).
Track 18, sector 1 is the first sector containing directory entries: There are eight 32 byte entries per sector, with a maximum filename length of 16 characters. The first two bytes of a directory sector point to
the next directory entry sector.
The files on disk are also stored as a linked list. The
first two bytes of every sector are either the track and
sector number of the next block, or the first byte is 0
and the second byte is the number of valid bytes in
this sector.
The 1541 is a stripped down version of the PET drive
series, which had a parallel connection, and contained two 6502 CPUs: One for doing the filesystem
and communicating with the computer, and one for
reading data from disk and writing data to it, as well
as encoding and decoding the data. The 1541 only has
a single 6502 CPU running at 1 MHz, which (using
timer IRQs) regularly switches itself between the two
modes. The two virtual CPUs still communicate with
each other using a messaging interface in the zero
page. The 1541 has 2 KB of RAM at $0000-$07FF.
The 1541 has two VIA I/O controllers at $1800 (for
the IEC bus) and at $1C00 (for the drive). The firmware is located at $C000-$FFFF.
Since loading an application or a game takes minutes
on an unmodified C64, several ”floppy speeders” appeared (either as software on disk or built into applications, as ROM extension cartridges, or as internal
replacement ROMs), that consisted of implementations of more optimized protocols for the IEC bus for
both the C64 and the 1541. The 1541 code was uploaded using the old bus protocol. Such a new protocol would for example not do a handshake on every
bit using the clock line, but shift a complete byte
through in 4 steps, two bits at a time, using the clock
and data line at the same time. This would of course
only work if both CPUs were not interrupted. VIC
timing on the C64 side could already affect this, so
many floppy speeders turned off the screen while
loading.
