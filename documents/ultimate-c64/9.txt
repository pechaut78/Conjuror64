Flags and Branches
All load and logic instructions set N and Z accordingly, shift instructions also modify C, and arithmetic
instructions touch N V, Z and C. The D (decimal), I
(interrupt disable) and C flags can be set and cleared
programmatically (CLD/SED, CLI/SEI, CLC/SEC),
while the V flag can only be cleared (CLV). Conditional branches are possible based on the value of the
negative (BPL/BMI), overflow (BVC/BVS), zero
(BNE/BEQ) and carry (BCC/BCS) flags. Branches
encode an 8 bit relative offset and can therefore reach
code in the area of +127 and -128. Since a compare is
the same as a subtraction, BCC is a branch on (unsigned) below, and BCS is a branch on above-orequal.
NOP
NOP (no operation) does nothing. Its encoding is
$EA.
Decimal Mode
If the D flag is set, all ADC and SBC operations will be
BCD-adjusted afterwards, i.e. $09+$02 won't be $0B,
but $11, since 9+2=11. The BCD correction circuit has
been patented in US patent 3,991,307.
