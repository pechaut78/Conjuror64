question,answer
"What is the most common disk drive used with the C64?","The Commodore 1541 Disk Drive"
"What type of disks does the 1541 use?","5.25'' SS/DD (single side, double density) disks"
"What is the purpose of the SYNC marker in the 1541?","to be able to tell the start of a sector"
"Why does the 1541 only use 35 out of the 40 possible tracks on a 5.25\" disk?","due to reliability problems of early drives"
"How many sectors are on a 5.25\" disk in the 1541?","683 sectors"
"What is the total storage capacity of a 5.25\" disk in the 1541?","174,848 bytes"
"Where is the file system stored on a 1541 disk?","track 18"
"What is stored in track 18, sector 0 of a 1541 disk?","the disk name and the BAM (block availability map)"
"What is the purpose of the BAM in a 1541 disk?","to store one bit per sector (1 = free)"
"How many directory entries are stored in each sector of a 1541 disk?","eight 32 byte entries"
"What is the maximum filename length in a 1541 directory entry?","16 characters"
"How are files stored on a 1541 disk?","as a linked list"
"What is the purpose of the first two bytes of every sector in a 1541 disk?","to point to the next block, or to indicate the number of valid bytes in this sector"
"What is the 1541 a stripped down version of?","the PET drive series"
"How many CPUs does the 1541 have?","one 6502 CPU"
"What is the clock speed of the 6502 CPU in the 1541?","1 MHz"
"How does the 1541 CPU switch between modes?","using timer IRQs"
"How much RAM does the 1541 have?","2 KB of RAM at $0000-$07FF"
"What is the purpose of the VIA I/O controllers in the 1541?","to control the IEC bus and the drive"
"Where is the firmware located in the 1541?","at $C000-$FFFF"
"Why did floppy speeders appear for the 1541?","because loading an application or a game takes minutes on an unmodified C64"
"What is the purpose of floppy speeders for the 1541?","to implement more optimized protocols for the IEC bus"
"How do floppy speeders optimize the IEC bus protocol?","by shifting a complete byte through in 4 steps, two bits at a time, using the clock and data line at the same time"
