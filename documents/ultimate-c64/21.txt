Scrolling
The VIC supports hardware X and Y scrolling by 0 to
7 pixels. Since the 40th column is half visible and another column left of the first column is half-visible
when the horizontal shift register is set to e.g. 4, a
41th column would be needed. Instead, it is possible
to switch the screen to 38 column mode, i.e. the
whole screen is a little narrower, and more border is
shown on the left and on the right. The screen can
also be switched from 25 to 24 lines the same way.
