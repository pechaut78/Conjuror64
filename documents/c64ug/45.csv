"what is the purpose of the GET command in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The GET command allows you to input one character at a time from the keyboard without hitting <RETURN>, which can speed up data entry in many applications. Whatever key is hit is assigned to the variable specified with GET."
"how does the GET command work in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The GET command works by allowing the user to input a single character from the keyboard, which is then assigned to a variable. In the example routine, the GET command is used to input a character, which is then printed to the screen and the process repeats."
"what is the purpose of the line '10 GET A$: IF A$ = "" THEN 10' in the example routine?","The purpose of this line is to use the GET command to input a character from the keyboard and store it in the variable A$. The IF statement checks if the input character is empty, and if so, it loops back to line 10 to prompt the user to enter a character again."
"why is it important to use the PRINT command with GET in Commodore 64 BASIC?","It is important to use the PRINT command with GET because the character entered will not be displayed on the screen unless it is specifically printed using the PRINT command. This is demonstrated in the example routine where the input character is printed to the screen using the command 'PRINT A$;'."
"what is the purpose of the line 'PRINT "{CLR/HOME}"' in the example routine?","The purpose of this line is to clear the screen and move the cursor to the home position before starting the GET loop. This is done using the command 'PRINT "{CLR/HOME}"', which is a Commodore 64 BASIC command to clear the screen and home the cursor."
"how does the example routine use the GET command to input characters from the keyboard?","The example routine uses the GET command to input characters from the keyboard by using the command 'GET A$' to input a character and store it in the variable A$. The routine then prints the input character to the screen using the command 'PRINT A$;' and loops back to prompt the user to enter another character."
"what happens when the user hits a key while running the example routine?","When the user hits a key while running the example routine, the character is input using the GET command and stored in the variable A$. The routine then prints the input character to the screen using the command 'PRINT A$;' and loops back to prompt the user to enter another character."
"why is the GOTO 10 command used in the example routine?","The GOTO 10 command is used in the example routine to loop back to line 10, which contains the GET command, to prompt the user to enter another character. This creates an infinite loop that continues to input and print characters until the program is stopped."
"what is the purpose of the NEW command in the example routine?","The NEW command is used to clear the program memory and start a new program. In the example routine, the NEW command is used to start a new program that uses the GET command to input characters from the keyboard."
"how does the example routine demonstrate the use of the GET command?","The example routine demonstrates the use of the GET command by using it to input characters from the keyboard, storing them in a variable, and printing them to the screen. The routine shows how the GET command can be used to create a loop that continues to input and print characters until the program is stopped."
