"what is the purpose of the CMD command in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The CMD command is used to redirect the output of PRINT statements, LIST commands, and other output that would normally go to the screen to another device, such as a printer or a file on tape or disk, instead of the screen. This allows the user to send output to a device other than the screen, and is commonly used for printing program listings or output to a file."
"what is the syntax for using the CMD command?","The CMD command must be followed by a number or numeric variable that refers to the file or device that the output should be sent to, which must be OPENed first."
"how do you redirect output to the printer using the CMD command?","You can redirect output to the printer by first OPENing the printer device, which is device #4, and then using the CMD command followed by the number 1, which refers to the printer device. For example, 'OPEN 1,4' followed by 'CMD 1' would redirect all normal output to the printer."
"what happens to the program listing when you use the CMD command?","When you use the CMD command, the program listing will be sent to the device or file specified, instead of the screen. This means that the LIST command will output the program listing to the device or file, rather than displaying it on the screen."
"how do you send output back to the screen after using the CMD command?","To send output back to the screen after using the CMD command, you need to CLOSE the file with the CLOSE command, followed by the number of the file. For example, 'CLOSE 1' would close the file and send output back to the screen."
"what is the difference between the CMD command and the PRINT command?","The CMD command is used to redirect output to a device or file, whereas the PRINT command is used to output text or values to the screen or a file. The PRINT command is used to specify the output, whereas the CMD command is used to specify where the output should go."
"can you use the CMD command with POKE statements?","No, the CMD command does not affect POKE statements, which always output to the screen. The CMD command only affects output that would normally go to the screen, such as PRINT statements and LIST commands."
"what is the purpose of the OPEN command when using the CMD command?","The OPEN command is used to open a file or device before using the CMD command to redirect output to it. The file or device must be OPENed before the CMD command can be used."
"can you use the CMD command with a variable?","Yes, the CMD command can be used with a numeric variable that refers to the file or device. For example, 'CMD X' would redirect output to the file or device referred to by the variable X."
"what happens if you try to use the CMD command without opening a file or device first?","If you try to use the CMD command without opening a file or device first, an error will occur, because the CMD command requires a file or device to be OPENed before it can be used."
