C64 Color Adjustment

  There  is  a simple way to get a pattern of colors on the TV so you can
easily  adjust  the  set.  Even  though  you may not be familiar with the
operation  of the computer right now,  just follow along,  and you'll see
how easy it is to use the Commodore 64.
  First,  look on the left side of the keyboard and locate the key marked
<CTRL>.  This  stands for ConTRoL and is used,  in conjunction with other
keys, to instruct the computer to do a specific task.

  To  use  a  control  function,  you  hold  down  the  <CTRL>  key while
depressing a second key.
  Try this:  hold the <CTRL> key  while also depressing the <9> key. Then
release both keys. Nothing obvious should have happened, but if you touch
any  key  now,  the  screen  will show the character displayed in reverse
type, rather than normal type -- like the opening message or anything you
typed earlier.
  Hold down the <SPACE BAR>. What happens? If you did the above procedure
correctly,  you  should  see  a light blue bar move across the screen and
then move down to the next line as long as the <SPACE BAR> is depressed.

  Now,  hold <CTRL>  while depressing any of the other number keys.  Each
of  them  has a color  marked on the front.  Anything displayed from this
point will be in that color. For example, hold <CTRL> and the <8> key and
release both. Now hold the <SPACE BAR>.
  Watch the display.  The bar is now in yellow!  In a like manner you can
change  the  bar  to  any  of  the colors indicated on the number keys by
holding <CTRL> and the appropriate key.
  Change the bar to a few more different colors and then adjust the color
and  tint  controls  on  your  TV  so  the display matches the colors you
selected.
  The display should appear something like this:

     **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****

  READY.
  _________________________     <------ <3> Red bar
  _______ ____________ ____     <------ <3>,<6>,<7> Red, Green, Blue bars
  __________ ______________     <------ <7>,<8> Blue, Yellow bars
  ____________                  <------ <8> Yellow bar

  At  this  point  everything is properly adjusted and working correctly.
The following chapters will introduce you to the BASIC language. However,
you can  immediately start using some of the many prewritten applications
and  games available for the Commodore 64  without knowing anything about
computer programming.
  Each  of  these packages contains detailed information about how to use
the  program.  It is suggested,  though,  that you read through the first
few  chapters  of  this  manual  to  become  more familiar with the basic
operation of your new system.
