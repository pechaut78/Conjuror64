basic: LOAD

  This  command  is  used  to  transfer  a program from tape or disk into
memory  so  the  program  can  be  used.  If  you  just type LOAD and hit
RETURN,  the  first  program found on the cassette unit will be placed in
memory.  The  command  may  be followed by a program name enclosed within
quotes.  The  name  may  then  be  followed  by  a  comma and a number or
numeric  variable,  which  acts  as a device number to indicate where the
program is coming from.

  If  no  device  number  is  given,  the Commodore 64 assumes device #1,
which  is  the  cassette  unit.  The  other device commonly used with the
LOAD command is the disk device, which is device #8.

  LOAD              Reads in the next program on tape
  LOAD "HELLO"      Searches tape for program called HELLO,
                    and loads program, if found
  LOAD A$           Looks for program whose name is in the variable A$
  LOAD "HELLO",8    Looks for program called HELLO on the disk drive
  LOAD "*",8        Looks for first program on disk
