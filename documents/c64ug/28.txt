DISK:  Using your disk drive,  carefully insert the preprogrammed disk
so  that  the label on the disk is facing up and is closest to you.  Look
for  a  little notch on the disk (it might be covered with a little piece
of tape). If  you're inserting the disk properly the notch will be on the
left side.  Once the disk is inside  close the protective gate by pushing
down on the lever.  Now type  LOAD "PROGRAM NAME",8  and hit the <RETURN>
key. The disk will make noise and your screen will say:

  SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME
  LOADING
  READY.
  _

  When  the  READY  comes  on  and  the  _ is on, just type RUN, and your
prepackaged software is ready to use.
