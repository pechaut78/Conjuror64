<CRSR> key

  There are two keys marked <CRSR> (CuRSoR), one with up and down arrows,
the other with left and right arrows.  You can use these keys to move the
cursor up and down or left and right.  In the unshifted mode,  the <CRSR>
keys  will  let  you  move  the  cursor down and to the right.  Using the
<SHIFT> key and <CRSR> keys allows the cursor to be moved either up or to
the  left.  The  cursor keys have a special repeat feature that keeps the
cursor moving until you release the key.
