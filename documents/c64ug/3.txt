CONNECTIONS TO YOUR TV
Connect the computer to your TV as shown below.
1. Attach one end of the TV cable to the phono type TV signal jack at the
   rear of the Commodore 64. Just push it in. Either end of the cable can
   be used.
2. Connect the other end of the cable to the antenna switchbox. Just push
   it in.
3. If you have a VHF antenna, disconnect it from your TV set.
4. Connect your VHF antenna cable to the screw terminals labeled "antenna
   input"  on  the  switchbox.  If your antenna cable is the round 75-ohm
   coax  type,  use  a 75-ohm to 300-ohm adapter (not supplied) to attach
   your antenna cable to the switchbox.
5. Connect the twin lead output cable of the antenna switchbox to the VHF
   antenna  terminals  of  your  TV set.  If your set is one of the newer
   types  with  a round 75-ohm VHF connector,  you will need a 300-ohm to
   75-ohm converter (not supplied) to connect the switchbox to the 75-ohm
   VHF antenna input on the set.
6. Set  the  TV's  VHF  tuner  to  the  channel  number  indicated on the
   computer's  channel selector switch (channel 3  move the switch to the
   left,  channel 4  move the switch to the right).  If a strong local TV
   signal  is present on one of these channels,  select the other channel
   to avoid possible interference.
7. Plug  the  power supply cable into the power socket on the side of the
   Commodore 64.  Just  push  it in.  It is "keyed" to allow insertion in
   only one direction, so you can't connect the power cord the wrong way.
   The power supply converts household current into the form the computer
   uses.
