"what is the purpose of the NEXT statement in a FOR loop?","The NEXT statement is used in conjunction with the FOR statement to check if the loop has reached its limit, and if not, it increments the loop variable by the specified STEP value, and if the loop is finished, execution proceeds with the statement following NEXT."
"What happens when the NEXT statement is reached in a FOR loop?","When the NEXT statement is reached, the program checks the FOR statement to see if the limit of the loop has been reached, and if the loop is not finished, the loop variable is increased by the specified STEP value, and if the loop is finished, execution proceeds with the statement following NEXT."
"What is the effect of using NEXT with a variable name or list of variable names?","When NEXT is followed by a variable name or list of variable names, separated by commas, the variables are completed in order from left to right, and the loop is completed for each variable listed."
"What happens if no variable names are listed with the NEXT statement?","If no variable names are listed with the NEXT statement, the last loop started is the one being completed."
"What is the purpose of the STEP value in a FOR loop with NEXT?","The STEP value is used to increment the loop variable when the NEXT statement is reached, and determines the increment value for each iteration of the loop."
"Can multiple variables be listed with the NEXT statement?","Yes, multiple variables can be listed with the NEXT statement, separated by commas, and they will be completed in order from left to right."
"What determines when the loop is finished in a FOR loop with NEXT?","The loop is finished when the limit of the loop has been reached, as specified in the FOR statement, and the NEXT statement checks for this condition and proceeds with the statement following NEXT if the loop is finished."
"How does the NEXT statement interact with the FOR statement?","The NEXT statement is used in conjunction with the FOR statement, and checks the FOR statement to see if the limit of the loop has been reached, and if not, increments the loop variable by the specified STEP value."
"What is the syntax for using NEXT with multiple variables?","The syntax for using NEXT with multiple variables is to list the variables, separated by commas, after the NEXT statement, such as NEXT X, Y, Z."
"What happens when the loop is finished in a FOR loop with NEXT?","When the loop is finished, execution proceeds with the statement following NEXT, and the program continues with the next statement after the loop."
