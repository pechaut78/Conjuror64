basic: DEF FN

  This  command  allows you to define a complex calculation as a function
with a short name.  In the case of a long formula that is used many times
within the program, this can save time and space.
  This  function  name  will  be  FN and any legal variable name  (1 or 2
characters long).  First you must define the function using the statement
DEF  followed  by  the  function  name.  Following  the  name is a set of
parentheses enclosing a numeric variable. Then follows the actual formula
that  you want to define,  with the variable in the proper spot.  You can
then "call" the formula, substituting any number for the variable.

  10 DEF FN A(X) = 12 * ( 34.75 - X / .3 )
  20 PRINT FN A(7)
