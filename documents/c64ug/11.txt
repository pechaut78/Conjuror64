moments  to  familiarize  yourself  with  the keyboard which is your most
important means of communication with the Commodore 64.
  You  will  find  the keyboard similar to a standard typewriter keyboard
found  in  most  areas.  There  are,  however, a number of new keys which
control specialized functions. What follows is a brief description of the
various  keys  and how they function.  The detailed operation of each key
will be covered in later sections.
