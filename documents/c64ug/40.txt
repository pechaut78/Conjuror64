basic: how to start ?

Clear the screen by holding down the <SHIFT> key, and then depressing the
<CLR/HOME> key.
Type NEW and press <RETURN>. (This just clears out any numbers that might
have been left in the computer from your experimenting.)
Now type the following exactly as shown  (remember to hit <RETURN>  after
each line)

  10 ? "COMMODORE 64"
  20 GOTO 10

  Now, type RUN and hit <RETURN> -- watch what happens.  Your screen will
come alive with COMMODORE 64. After you've finished watching the display,
hit <RUN/STOP> to stop the program.
