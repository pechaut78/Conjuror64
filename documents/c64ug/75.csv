"what is the main difference between GOSUB and GOTO statements in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The main difference between GOSUB and GOTO statements is that GOSUB remembers the line number it jumped from, allowing the program to return to that line after executing the subroutine, whereas GOTO simply jumps to a specified line number without remembering where it came from."
"What is the purpose of the RETURN statement in a GOSUB routine?","The purpose of the RETURN statement is to indicate the end of a subroutine and return the program flow to the statement immediately following the GOSUB statement that called the subroutine."
"How can you reuse a routine in multiple parts of a program using GOSUB?","You can reuse a routine in multiple parts of a program by executing a GOSUB statement each time the routine is needed, instead of typing the routine over and over, making your code more efficient and easier to maintain."
"What happens when a program encounters a GOTO statement?","When a program encounters a GOTO statement, the next line to be executed will be the one with the line number following the word GOTO, allowing the program to jump to a specific line number."
"What is the syntax for calling a subroutine using GOSUB?","The syntax for calling a subroutine using GOSUB is `GOSUB <line number>`, where `<line number>` is the line number of the first line of the subroutine, for example `20 GOSUB 800` calls the subroutine starting at line 800."
"In what way does GOSUB improve code organization and reusability?","GOSUB improves code organization and reusability by allowing you to write a routine once and reuse it multiple times in your program, making your code more modular and easier to maintain."
"How does the computer remember the line number to return to after a GOSUB?","The computer remembers the line number to return to after a GOSUB by storing the line number of the GOSUB statement in a stack, so that when a RETURN statement is encountered, it can jump back to the correct line number."
"What is the advantage of using GOSUB over typing a routine multiple times?","The advantage of using GOSUB over typing a routine multiple times is that it saves memory and reduces the chance of errors, as you only need to write and debug the routine once, and can then reuse it throughout your program."
"Can you use GOSUB to call a subroutine located at the end of a program?","Yes, you can use GOSUB to call a subroutine located at the end of a program, as long as you specify the correct line number of the subroutine, the program will jump to that line and execute the subroutine."
"What happens when a RETURN statement is encountered in a subroutine?","When a RETURN statement is encountered in a subroutine, the program jumps back to the statement immediately following the GOSUB statement that called the subroutine, allowing the program to continue executing from where it left off."
