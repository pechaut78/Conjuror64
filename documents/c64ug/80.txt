basic: ON

  This command turns the GOTO and GOSUB commands into special versions of
the IF statement. ON is followed by a formula, which is evaluated. If the
result of the calculation is one, the first line on the list is executed;
if the result is 2, the second line is executed, and so on. If the result
is 0,  negative,  or  larger  than  the  list  of numbers,  the next line
executed will be the statement following the ON statement.
