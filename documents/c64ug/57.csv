"what is the order of operations when multiple operators are used on the same line?","The order of operations when multiple operators are used on the same line is as follows: First, exponentiation, then multiplication and division, and last, addition and subtraction. This order can be changed by enclosing calculations within parentheses, which will be performed first."
"what is the purpose of parentheses in arithmetic operations?","The purpose of parentheses in arithmetic operations is to change the order of operations by enclosing the calculation to be performed first. This allows the programmer to specify the order in which operations should be performed, overriding the default order of operations."
"what is the difference between the AND and OR logical operators?","The AND logical operator requires both parts of a condition to be true, whereas the OR logical operator allows either part of a condition to be true. For example, IF A=B AND C=D THEN 100 requires both A=B and C=D to be true, whereas IF A=B OR C=D THEN 100 allows either A=B or C=D to be true."
"how do you raise a number to a power in C64 BASIC?","You can raise a number to a power in C64 BASIC using the caret symbol (^). For example, 2^3 would raise 2 to the power of 3, resulting in 8."
"what is the purpose of the NOT logical operator?","The NOT logical operator is used to negate a condition, making it false if it was true, and true if it was false. It is often used in IF...THEN statements to test for the opposite of a condition."
"what is the difference between the = and <> operators?","The = operator is used to test for equality, whereas the <> operator is used to test for inequality. For example, IF A=B THEN 100 would execute if A is equal to B, whereas IF A<>B THEN 100 would execute if A is not equal to B."
"how do you perform multiplication in C64 BASIC?","You can perform multiplication in C64 BASIC using the asterisk symbol (*). For example, 2*3 would multiply 2 by 3, resulting in 6."
"what is the purpose of the <= and >= operators?","The <= operator is used to test if a value is less than or equal to another value, whereas the >= operator is used to test if a value is greater than or equal to another value. For example, IF A<=B THEN 100 would execute if A is less than or equal to B, whereas IF A>=B THEN 100 would execute if A is greater than or equal to B."
"what is the order of precedence when using multiple operators on the same line?","The order of precedence when using multiple operators on the same line is as follows: First, exponentiation, then multiplication and division, and last, addition and subtraction. This order can be changed by enclosing calculations within parentheses, which will be performed first."
"how do you perform division in C64 BASIC?","You can perform division in C64 BASIC using the forward slash symbol (/). For example, 6/2 would divide 6 by 2, resulting in 3."
