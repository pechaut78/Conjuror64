basic: VERIFY

  This  command  causes  the  computer  to  check  the program on disk or
tape  against  the  one  in  memory.  This  is  proof that the program is
actually SAVEd,  in case the tape or disk is bad, or something went wrong
during  the  SAVE.  VERIFY  without anything after the command causes the
Commodore  64  to  check  the  next  program on tape, regardless of name,
against the program in memory.
  VERIFY  followed by a program name,  or a string variable,  will search
for that program and then check. Device numbers can also be included with
the verify command.
