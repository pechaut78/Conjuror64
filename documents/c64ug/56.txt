basic: Arrays are lists of variables with the same name,  using extra  numbers
to specify the element of the array.  Arrays are defined  using  the  DIM
statement, and may contain floating point, integer,  or string variables.
The array variable name is followed by a set of parentheses ( ) enclosing
the number of variables in the list.

  A(7), BZ%(11), A$(50), PT(20,20)

  NOTE:  There are three variable names which are reserved for use by the
Commodore 64, and may not be defined by you.  These variables are: ST, TI
and  TI$.   ST  is  a  status  variable  which  relates  to  input/output
operations.  The value of ST will change  if there is a problem loading a
program from disk or tape.
  TI and TI$ are variables which relate to the real-time clock built into
the Commodore 64. The variable TI is updated every 1/60th of a second. It
starts at 0 when the computer is turned on, and is reset only by changing
the value of TI$.
  TI$  is a string which is constantly updated by the system.  The  first
two characters contain the number of hours , the  3rd and 4th  characters
the number of minutes,  and  the 5th and 6th characters are the number of
seconds.  This  variable  can  be  given  any numeric value,  and will be
updated from that point.

  TI$ = "101530" sets the clock to 10:15 and 30 seconds AM.

  This clock is erased when the computer is turned  off,  and  starts  at
zero when the system is turned back on.
