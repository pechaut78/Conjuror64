basic: CMD

  CMD sends the output which normally would go to the screen (i.e., PRINT
statements,  LISTs,  but  not  POKEs  onto the screen)  to another device
instead.  This could be a printer,  or a data file on tape or disk.  This
device or file must be OPENed first.  The CMD command must be followed by
a number or numeric variable referring to the file.

  OPEN 1,4          OPENs device #4, which is the printer
  CMD 1             All normal output now goes to printer
  LIST              The program listing now goes to
                    the printer, not the screen

  To send output back to the screen, CLOSE the file with CLOSE 1.
