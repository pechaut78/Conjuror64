basic: SAVE

  This  command  will  store  the program currently in memory on cassette
or  disk.  If  you  just  type SAVE and RETURN, the program will be SAVEd
on  cassette.  The  computer  has no way of knowing if there is a program
already  on  that  tape, so be careful with your tapes or you may erase a
valuable program.
  If you type SAVE followed by a name in quotes or a string variable, the
computer  will  give  the  program  that  name,  so it can be more easily
located  and retrieved in the future.  The name may also be followed by a
device number.
  After  the  device  number,  there  can be a comma and a second number,
either  0  or  1. If the second number is 1, the Commodore 64 will put an
END-OF-TAPE  marker  after  your  program.  This signals the computer not
to  look  any  further on the tape if you were to give an additional LOAD
command.  If  you  try  to  LOAD  a program and the computer finds one of
these markers, you will get a FILE NOT FOUND ERROR.
