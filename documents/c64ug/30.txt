LOADING PROGRAMS FROM DISK

  Loading a program from disk follows the same format. Type:

  LOAD "PROGRAM NAME",8

  The  8  is  the  code for the disk, so you're just letting the computer
know that you want the program loaded from the disk.
  After  you  hit  <RETURN>  the disk will start whirring and the display
shows:

  SEARCHING FOR PROGRAM NAME
  LOADING
  READY.
  _

NOTE:
  When   you   load  a  new  program  into  the  computer's  memory,  any
instructions  that  were  in the computer previously will be erased. Make
sure  you  save  a  program  you're  working on before loading a new one.
Once a program has been loaded, you can RUN it, LIST, or make changes and
re-save the new version.
