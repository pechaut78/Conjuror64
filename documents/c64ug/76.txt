basic: IF ... THEN

  IF ... THEN lets the computer analyze a situation and take two possible
courses of action,  depending on the outcome.  If the expression is true,
the  statement  following  THEN  is  executed.  This  may  be  any  BASIC
statement.
  If the expression is false, the program goes directly to the next line.
  The expression being evaluated may be a variable or formula,  in  which
case it is considered true if nonzero,  and false if zero.  In most cases,
there  is an expression involving relational operators  (=, <, >, <=, >=,
<>, AND, OR, NOT).
