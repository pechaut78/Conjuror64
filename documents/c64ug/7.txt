USING THE COMMODORE 64

1. Turn  on  the computer using the rocker switch on the right-side panel
   when you're looking at the computer from the front.
2. After a few moments the following will be displayed on the TV screen:

      **** COMMODORE 64 BASIC V2 ****
   64K RAM SYSTEM  38911 BASIC BYTES FREE

   READY.
   _  

Cursor signals Commodore 64 is waiting for your input

3. If your TV has a manual fine tuning knob,  adjust the TV until you get
   a clear picture.
4. You  may also want to adjust the color and tint controls on the TV for
   the best display. You can use the color adjustment procedure described
   later to get everything setup properly.  When you first get a picture,
   the  screen  should appear mostly dark blue,  with a light blue border
   and letters.
