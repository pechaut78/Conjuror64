basic: DIM

  When you use more than 11 elements of an array,  you must execute a DIM
statement for the array.  Keep in mind that the whole array takes up room
in  memory,  so  don't  create  an  array  much  larger than you'll need.
To  figure  the number of variables created with DIM,  multiply the total
number of elements in each dimension of the array.

  10 DIM A$(40), B7(15), CC%(4,4,4)
             ^       ^         ^
             |       |         |
   41 elements  16 elements  125 elements

  You  can  dimension more than one array in a DIM statement. However, be
careful not to dimension an array more than once.
