basic: POKE

  POKE is always followed by two numbers, or formulas. The first location
is a memory location; the second number is a decimal value from 0 to 255,
which  will  be  placed in the memory location,  replacing any previously
stored value.

  10 POKE 53281,0
  20 S = 4096 * 13
  30 POKE S + 29, 8

PRINT

  The  PRINT  statement  is  the  first one most people learn to use, but
there  are  a  number of variations to be aware of. PRINT can be followed
by:

  Text String with quotes
  Variable names
  Functions
  Punctuation marks

  Punctuation  marks  are used to help format the data on the screen. The
comma   divides  the  screen  into  four  columns,  while  the  semicolon
suppresses  all  spacing.  Either mark can be last symbol on a line. This
results  in the next thing PRINTed acting as if it were a continuation of
the same PRINT statement.

  10 PRINT "HELLO"
  20 PRINT "HELLO", A$
  30 PRINT A + B
  40 PRINT J;
  50 PRINT A, B, C, D
