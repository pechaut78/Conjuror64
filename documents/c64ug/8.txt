TIP:  The  COMMODORE 64  was designed  to be used by everyone.  But we at
Commodore  recognize  that  computer  users may,  occasionally,  run into
difficulties.  To  help  answer  your  questions  and  give  you some fun
programming  ideas,  Commodore  has  created several publications to help
you.  You might also find that it's a good idea to join a Commodore Users
Club  to  help  you  meet some other COMMODORE 64 owners who can help you
gain knowledge and experience.
