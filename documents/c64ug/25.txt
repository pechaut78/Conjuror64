Loading and Saving Programs

  One  of  the most important features of the Commodore 64 is the ability
to save and load programs to and from cassette tape or disk.
  This  capability allows you to save the programs you write for use at a
later time, or purchase prewritten programs to use with the Commodore 64.
  Make  sure  that  either  the  disk  drive or cassette unit is attached
properly.
