"How does the TI variable work in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The TI variable is updated every 1/60th of a second and starts at 0 when the computer is turned on. It can be reset by changing the value of TI$."
"What is the purpose of the TI$ variable in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The TI$ variable is a string that is constantly updated by the system, containing the current time in the format HHMMSS. It can be set to a specific time using a numeric value, and will be updated from that point."
"How do you set the clock in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The clock can be set using the TI$ variable, for example, TI$ = \"101530\" sets the clock to 10:15 and 30 seconds AM."
"What happens to the clock when the computer is turned off?","The clock is erased when the computer is turned off, and starts at zero when the system is turned back on."
