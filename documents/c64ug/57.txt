basic: OPERATORS

  The arithmetic operators include the following signs:

  +  Addition
  -  Subtraction
  *  Multiplication
  /  Division
  ^  Raising to a power (exponentiation)

  On a line  containing  more than one operator,  there is a set order in
which operations always occur. If several operations are used together on
the  same  line,  the  computer  assigns  priorities  as follows:  First,
exponentiation. Next, multiplication and division, and last, addition and
subtraction.
  You can change the order of operations  by enclosing within parentheses
the calculation to be performed first. Operations enclosed in parentheses
will take place before other operations.
  There are also operations for equalities and inequalities:

  =  Equal To
  <  Less Than
  >  Greater Than
  <= Less Than or Equal To
  >= Greater Than or Equal To
  <> Not Equal To

  Finally, there are three logical operators:

  AND
  OR
  NOT

  These are used most  often  to  join  multiple  formulas  in  IF...THEN
statements. For example:

  IF A=B AND C=D THEN 100  (Requires both parts to be true)
  IF A=B OR  C=D THEN 100  (Allows either part to be true)
