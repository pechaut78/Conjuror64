basic: DATA

  This  statement  is  followed  by  a  list  of items to be used by READ
statements.  Items  may  be numeric values or text strings, and items are
separated  by commas.  String items need not be inside quote marks unless
they contain space,  colon, or comma.  If two commas have nothing between
them, the value will be READ as a zero for a number, or an empty string.
