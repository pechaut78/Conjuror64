basic: INPUT


To get an idea of how INPUT works,  type  NEW  <RETURN>  and enter this
short program:

  10 INPUT A$
  20 PRINT "YOU TYPED: ";A$
  30 PRINT
  40 GOTO 10
  RUN
  ? COMMODORE 64 
  YOU TYPED: COMMODORE 64 

  What  happens  when  you  run this simple program. A question mark will
appear,  indicating  that  the  computer  is  waiting  for  you  to  type
something. Enter any character, or group of characters, from the keyboard
and  hit  <RETURN>.  The  computer  will  then  respond with "YOU TYPED:"
followed by the information you entered.
You  can  INPUT  either numeric or string variables,  and even have the
INPUT statement prompt the user with a message. The format of INPUT is:

  INPUT "PROMPT MESSAGE";VARIABLE


Or, just:

  INPUT VARIABLE

NOTE:  To  get out of this program hold down the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE>
keys.
