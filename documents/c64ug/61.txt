basic: NEW

  This  command  erases  the  entire  program in memory,  and also clears
out  any  variables  that  may  have  been  used.  Unless the program was
SAVEd, it is lost. BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU USE THIS COMMAND.
  The NEW command can also be used as a BASIC program statement. When the
program reaches this line,  the program is erased.  This is useful if you
want to leave everything neat when the program is done.
