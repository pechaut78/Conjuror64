"what is the purpose of the DEF FN command in Commodore 64 BASIC","The DEF FN command allows you to define a complex calculation as a function with a short name, which can save time and space in your program, especially when a long formula is used many times within the program."
"What is the format of the DEF FN statement","The format of the DEF FN statement is DEF followed by the function name, which can be any legal variable name (1 or 2 characters long), then a set of parentheses enclosing a numeric variable, and finally the actual formula that you want to define, with the variable in the proper spot."
"How do you call a function defined with DEF FN","You can call a function defined with DEF FN by using the function name followed by the value you want to substitute for the variable, for example, if you defined a function FN A(X) = 12 * ( 34.75 - X / .3 ), you can call it with PRINT FN A(7) to get the result of the formula with X = 7."
"What is the advantage of using DEF FN in your program","The advantage of using DEF FN is that it saves time and space in your program, especially when a long formula is used many times within the program, by defining the formula once and then calling it whenever you need it."
"Can you give an example of a DEF FN statement","Here is an example of a DEF FN statement: 10 DEF FN A(X) = 12 * ( 34.75 - X / .3 ), which defines a function A that takes one argument X and returns the result of the formula 12 * ( 34.75 - X / .3 )."
"What is the role of the parentheses in a DEF FN statement","The parentheses in a DEF FN statement enclose the numeric variable that is used in the formula, for example, in DEF FN A(X) = 12 * ( 34.75 - X / .3 ), the parentheses enclose the variable X."
"How do you define a function with DEF FN","To define a function with DEF FN, you use the format DEF followed by the function name, then a set of parentheses enclosing a numeric variable, and finally the actual formula that you want to define, with the variable in the proper spot."
"What is the benefit of using a short function name with DEF FN","The benefit of using a short function name with DEF FN is that it saves space in your program and makes your code more readable and easier to maintain."
"Can you use a DEF FN function in a mathematical expression","Yes, you can use a DEF FN function in a mathematical expression, for example, you can use the result of the function as part of a larger formula, or use the function as an argument to another function."
"What happens when you call a DEF FN function with a value","When you call a DEF FN function with a value, the function substitutes the value for the variable in the formula and returns the result of the formula with that value."
