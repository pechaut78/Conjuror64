CASSETTES:  Use  your  DATASSETTE  recorder  and  the  ordinary  audio
cassettes  that  came as part of your prepackaged program.  Make sure the
tape is completely rewound to the beginning of the first side.  Then just
type  LOAD.  The  computer  will  answer with PRESS PLAY ON TAPE,  so you
respond  by  pressing play on your datassette machine.  At this point the
computer  screen  will go blank until the program is found.  The computer
will say  FOUND (PROGRAM NAME)  on the screen.  Now you press down on the
<C=> key.  This will actually load the program into the computer.  If you
want to stop the loading simply press <RUN/STOP> key.
