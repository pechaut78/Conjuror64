"what is the purpose of the CONT command in a C64 program?","The CONT command is used to restart the execution of a program that has been stopped by either using the <STOP> key, a STOP statement, or an END statement within the program. It allows the program to restart at the exact place from where it left off, without any changes or additions to the program."
"what happens if you try to use CONT after changing or adding lines to a program?","If you try to use CONT after changing or adding lines to a program, or even just moving the cursor, you will get a CAN'T CONTINUE ERROR.

"what is the difference between STOP and END statements in a C64 program?","The STOP statement and END statement both stop the execution of a program, but they can be restarted with the CONT command.
