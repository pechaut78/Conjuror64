basic:  Variables

  Variables  are  some  of  the  most  used  features  of any programming
language,  because  variables  can represent much more information in the
computer.  Understanding how variables operate will make computing easier
and allow us to accomplish feats that would not be possible otherwise.
  Imagine a number of boxes within the computer that can hold a number or
a string of text characters.  Each of these boxes is to be labeled with a
name  that  we choose.  That name is called a variable and represents the
information in the respective box.
  For example, if we say:

  10 X% = 15
  20 X = 23.5
  30 X$ = "THE SUM OF X% + X ="

  The computer might represent the variables like this:

  X%  15

  X   23.5

  X$  THE SUM OF X% + X =

  A  variable  name  represents  the  box,  or memory location, where the
current  value  of  the variable is stored. As you can see, we can assign
either  an  integer  number, floating point number, or a text string to a
variable.
  The '%' symbol  following  a  variable name indicates the variable will
represent  an  integer  number.  The following are valid integer variable
names:

  A%
  X%
  A1%
  NM%

  The  '$'  following  the  variable  name  indicates  the  variable will
represent a text string. The following are examples of string variables:

  A$
  X$
  MI$

  Floating  point  variables  follow  the  same  format,  with  the  type
indicator:

  A1
  X
  Y
  MI
