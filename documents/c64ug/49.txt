basic:  PEEKs and POKEs

  Just  as  variables  could be thought of as a representation of "boxes"
within the machine where you placed your information,  you can also think
of  some  specially  defined  "boxes"  within the computer that represent
specific memory locations.

  The  Commodore 64  looks  at  these  memory  locations  to see what the
screen's background and border color should be, what characters are to be
displayed on the screen -- and where -- and a host of other tasks.
  By  placing,  "POKEing",  a  different  value  into  the  proper memory
location,  we can change colors, define and move objects, and even create
music.

  Above  we  showed just four locations,  two of which control the screen
and background colors. Try typing this:

  POKE 53281,7 <RETURN>

  The  background  color  of  the screen will change to yellow because we
placed the value '7' --  for yellow --  in the location that controls the
background color of the screen.
