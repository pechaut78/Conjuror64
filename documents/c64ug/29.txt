LOADING PROGRAMS FROM TAPE

  Loading  a program back from tape or disk is just as simple.  For tape,
rewind the tape back to the beginning and type:

  LOAD "PROGRAM NAME"

  If  you  don't remember the program name,  just type LOAD and the first
program on the tape will be loaded into memory.
  After you press <RETURN> the computer will respond with:

  PRESS PLAY ON TAPE

  After  you  depress  the  play  key, the screen will blank, turning the
border color of the screen as the computer searches for the program.
  When the program is found, the screen will display:

  FOUND PROGRAM NAME

To  actually  load  the  program,  depress the <C=> key. To abandon the
loading  procedure,  hit  <RUN/STOP>.  If  you hit the Commodore key, the
screen  will  again  turn  the  border color while the program is loaded.
After  the  loading procedure is completed, the screen will return to the
normal state and the READY prompt will reappear.
