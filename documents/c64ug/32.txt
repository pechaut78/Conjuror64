SAVING PROGRAMS ON DISK

  Saving a program on disk is even simpler. Type:

  SAVE "PROGRAM NAME",8

  The  8  is  the code for the disk,  so you're just letting the computer
know you want the program saved to disk.
  After you press  <RETURN>  the disk will start to turn and the computer
will respond with:

  SAVING PROGRAM NAME
  OK
  READY.
