"What is a raster in the context of a monitor's video screen?","A raster is an interrupt triggered by the ray gun on the back of a monitor when a certain line is drawn on the video screen. This interrupt is generated by the VIDEO chip and can be used to change memory locations and create different video modes or effects."
"What causes an interrupt in a raster?","An interrupt in a raster is caused by the VIDEO chip when a specific screen line is drawn. This can be used to change the border color of the screen or modify the character definitions and video modes."
"How many times is the video screen redrawn per second?","The video screen is redrawn 60 times per second."
"How many scan lines are on a normal 25*40 display?","There are 200 scan lines on a normal 25*40 display."
"What is the range of scan line numbers on a normal 25*40 display?","Scan lines on a normal 25*40 display are numbered 50 to 250."
"Is the re-drawing of the screen synchronized with the electrical power?","Yes, the re-drawing of the screen is synchronized with the electrical power coming into the house, which is delivered at 60 Hz in the US and 50 Hz in Europe."
"Why can't regular interrupts be used to modify the screen?","Regular interrupts and raster-driven interrupts travel through the same vector and occur at slightly different rates, making it difficult to coordinate activity on the screen."
"What is the advantage of using raster-driven interrupts?","Using raster-driven interrupts allows you to know exactly which line on the screen is being drawn, enabling precise modification of the video screen."
"How many interrupts occur per second in total?","Both regular and raster-driven interrupts occur a total of 120 times per second."
"What must the code do when responding to an interrupt?","The code must check and see what the source of the interrupt was and act accordingly."
"What is the frequency of regular interrupts?","Regular interrupts occur 60 times per second."
"What is the frequency of raster-driven interrupts?","Raster-driven interrupts occur 60 times per second."
"What is the purpose of the CIA chip in relation to rasters?","The CIA chip is responsible for generating interrupts, but rasters specifically depend on interrupts generated by the VIDEO chip."
"What is the maximum number of character definitions that can be caused by a raster interrupt?","A raster interrupt can cause the bottom half of the screen to get its character definitions from another, different character set."
"What is the effect of a raster interrupt on the top and bottom borders of the screen?","The top and bottom borders of the screen are not included in the 200 scan lines of the normal 25*40 display."
"What is the effect of a raster interrupt on the video mode or effect?","A raster interrupt can quickly change some memory locations to create a different video mode or effect."
"What is the effect of a raster interrupt on the character set?","A raster interrupt can cause the bottom half of the screen to get its character definitions from another, different character set."
"What is the effect of a raster interrupt on the video resolution?","A raster interrupt can make the top 3/4 of the screen exist in hi-res multi-colour graphics, and keep the bottom 1/4 of the screen in text mode."
"What is the role of the VIDEO chip in rasters?","The VIDEO chip is responsible for generating the interrupts that rasters depend on."
"What is the role of the power supply in rasters?","The re-drawing of the screen is synchronized with the electrical power coming into the house."
"What is the effect of the power supply frequency on rasters?","The power supply frequency can affect the behavior of some programs, as it is delivered at 50 Hz in Europe and 60 Hz in the US."
"What is the purpose of checking the source of an interrupt?","Checking the source of an interrupt allows the code to act accordingly."
"What is the difference between regular interrupts and raster-driven interrupts?","Regular interrupts and raster-driven interrupts occur at slightly different rates and travel through the same vector."
"What is the effect of the difference in frequency between regular interrupts and raster-driven interrupts?","The difference in frequency between regular interrupts and raster-driven interrupts makes it difficult to coordinate activity on the screen."
