The system needs an interrupt to occur 60 times per second to do housekeeping,
and uses the CIA clock to generate the interrupts. We want to interrupt every 
time a certain scan line is reached on the monitor, which will also just happen
to occur at 60 times per second. We also have to make sure that they don't 
interfere with each other. The regular interrupts should be sent to their Rom
destination, while our video interrupts should go to our code, and no where 
else.

If both are occurring at 60 times per second, why not do the job of the system
Rom, and our video code on the SAME interrupt? We know that the CIA chip is not
good for this; it is out of sync with the video image. Why not turn OFF the CIA
interrupt, enable the raster/video interrupt, and do both jobs on one interrupt?
Then we would have an interrupt signal that occurs 60 times per second, and is
in perfect sync with the video image.
