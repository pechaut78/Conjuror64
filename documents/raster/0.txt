A raster is sort form for the concept of a 'raster interrupt'. Before
going into rasters, perhaps a brief review of interrupts is in order.

Interrupts are events generated by the CIA timer in the C64 to perform certain 
tasks. 60 times a second, the CIA chip signals an interrupt is due to be 
processed (ie. the interrupt timer timed out). This causes the 6510 CPU to stop
executing the current program, save the registers on the stack, and begin to 
execute the interrupt code. Some of the things which get done during an 
interrupt include the keyboard scan, and updating TI (the software clock). When
the interrupt code is finished, an RTI instruction is executed, which brings 
the interrupt's execution to a halt. The registers are retrieved from the stack,
and the current program in memory continues to execute once again. It will 
continue to do so until the next interrupt occurs, about 1/60 of a second later.

The above is what happens in a normal C64 (the C128 follows the same idea, but 
more events occur during a C128 interrupt). [Ed. Note: In addition, the C=128
generates its interrupts via a screen raster instead of the CIA chip.]

However, you can change the normal course of events, and cause some code of your
design to be added to the normal list of events which occur every interrupt. 
Some of the simple favourites include flashing the border 60 times per second.
(Note that we have not begun the topic of rasters yet; this has nothing to do
with rasters. That discussion begins at the next heading.)
