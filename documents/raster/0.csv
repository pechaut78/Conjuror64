"What are interrupts in a C64 and what triggers them?","Interrupts in a C64 are events generated by the CIA timer that occur 60 times per second. They are triggered by the CIA chip signaling that the interrupt timer has timed out, causing the 6510 CPU to stop executing the current program and begin executing the interrupt code."
"What happens during an interrupt in a C64?","During an interrupt in a C64, the CPU saves the registers on the stack, performs certain tasks such as keyboard scan and updating the software clock, and then halts the interrupt's execution. The registers are then retrieved from the stack, and the current program in memory continues to execute once again."
"What is the frequency of interrupts in a C64?","Interrupts in a C64 occur 60 times per second."
"What is the role of the CIA chip in interrupts in a C64?","The CIA chip in a C64 signals that the interrupt timer has timed out, triggering an interrupt."
"What happens to the current program when an interrupt occurs in a C64?","When an interrupt occurs in a C64, the CPU stops executing the current program and begins executing the interrupt code."
"What is the purpose of the RTI instruction in interrupts in a C64?","The RTI instruction in interrupts in a C64 brings the interrupt's execution to a halt, retrieves the registers from the stack, and allows the current program in memory to continue executing."
"What is the difference between interrupts in a C64 and a C128?","In a C128, interrupts are generated via a screen raster instead of the CIA chip, unlike in a C64."
"What is the frequency of interrupts in a C128?","Interrupts in a C128 occur 60 times per second, just like in a C64."
"What is an example of a simple favorite that can be added to the normal list of events during an interrupt in a C64?","A simple favorite that can be added to the normal list of events during an interrupt in a C64 is flashing the border 60 times per second."
"What is a raster in the context of interrupts in a C64?","A raster is a sort of form for the concept of a 'raster interrupt', which is discussed in the next heading and is separate from the CIA chip generated interrupts discussed in this section."
