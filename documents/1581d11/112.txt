1581 disk:  LOGICAL VERSUS PHYSICAL FORMAT

  All  DOS  operations  of  the 1581 are done in 256 byte blocks.
These blocks appear as individually numbered sectors on the disk.
By  going  through the DOS interface via the commands outlined in
this manual, the logical disk format is as follows:

  single sided
  80 tracks (track 1 through track 80)
  40 x 256 byte sectors per track (sector 0 through sector 39)

  Internally,  however,  the 1581 has a different view of things.
The disk is actually formatted as follows:

  double sided (side 0 and side 1)
  80 tracks per side (track 0 through track 79)
  10 x 512 byte sectors per track (sector 1 through sector 10)

  That  is  the  physical  disk  format created whenever a HEADER
(NEW)  command  is  sent  to the 1581 from the host computer. The
physical  format  is different from the logical so that more data
can be squeezed onto each disk.

  All commands sent from the host computer are parsed through the
DOS  (except the BURST commands) and refer to the logical format.
Software  inside the 1581 automatically takes care of the logical
to  physical translations necessary to retrieve the data properly
from the disk.
