1581 disk:  MEMORY-EXECUTE

  Any routine in disk memory,  either  in  RAM  or  ROM,  can  be
executed with the MEMORY-EXECUTE command. It is the equivalent of
the  BASIC  SYS call to a machine language program or subroutine,
but works in disk memory instead of within the computer.

FORMAT FOR THE MEMORY-EXECUTE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,"M-E"CHR$(<address)CHR$(>address)

where  "<address"  is the low order part,  and  ">address" is the
high order part of the address in disk memory  at which execution
is to begin.

  Most  uses  require intimate knowledge of the inner workings of
the  DOS,  and  preliminary  setup  with other commands,  such as
MEMORY-WRITE.

  The  routine  should  end  with an RTS to return control to the
1581.
