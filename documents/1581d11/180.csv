"what is error code 71 in a C64 disk controller command?","Error code 71 in a C64 disk controller command indicates a DIRECTORY ERROR, which means that the Block Availability Map (BAM) on the diskette does not match the copy in disk memory, requiring the diskette to be initialized to correct the issue."
"what is the cause of error code 71 in a C64 disk controller command?","The cause of error code 71 in a C64 disk controller command is a mismatch between the Block Availability Map (BAM) on the diskette and the copy in disk memory, which can be resolved by initializing the diskette."
"what is the Block Availability Map (BAM)?","The Block Availability Map (BAM) is a data structure on a C64 diskette that keeps track of the availability of blocks on the diskette, and it is used by the disk controller to manage file allocation and deallocation, and a mismatch between the BAM on the diskette and the copy in disk memory can cause error code 71."
"how do you correct error code 71 in a C64 disk controller command?","To correct error code 71 in a C64 disk controller command, you need to initialize the diskette, which will recreate the Block Availability Map (BAM) and ensure that it matches the copy in disk memory, resolving the DIRECTORY ERROR."
"what is the purpose of the Block Availability Map (BAM)?","The purpose of the Block Availability Map (BAM) is to keep track of the availability of blocks on a C64 diskette, allowing the disk controller to efficiently manage file allocation and deallocation, and ensuring that the diskette is used efficiently."
"what happens when the BAM on the diskette does not match the copy in disk memory?","When the BAM on the diskette does not match the copy in disk memory, it causes a DIRECTORY ERROR, which is indicated by error code 71 in a C64 disk controller command, and can be corrected by initializing the diskette."
"what is the relationship between the BAM and the disk controller?","The Block Availability Map (BAM) is used by the disk controller to manage file allocation and deallocation on a C64 diskette, and the disk controller relies on the BAM to ensure that files are stored and retrieved efficiently."
"what is the consequence of not initializing a diskette with a mismatched BAM?","If a diskette with a mismatched BAM is not initialized, it can lead to further errors and data corruption, making it essential to correct the issue by initializing the diskette to ensure data integrity."
"how does initializing a diskette correct error code 71?","Initializing a diskette corrects error code 71 by recreating the Block Availability Map (BAM) and ensuring that it matches the copy in disk memory, resolving the DIRECTORY ERROR and allowing the diskette to be used normally."
"what is the role of disk memory in relation to the BAM?","Disk memory stores a copy of the Block Availability Map (BAM) from the diskette, and it is used to verify the integrity of the BAM on the diskette, and a mismatch between the two can cause error code 71."
