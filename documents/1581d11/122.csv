question,answer
"what is the purpose of the EXBUF_DV job command in a 1581 disk controller?","The EXBUF_DV job command in a 1581 disk controller is used to execute the code in the corresponding job queue buffer after the motor is up to speed and the head is on track, ensuring that the disk is ready for data transfer or other operations."
"what happens when the motor is up to speed and the head is on track in a 1581 disk controller?","When the motor is up to speed and the head is on track in a 1581 disk controller, the EXBUF_DV job command executes the code in the corresponding job queue buffer, allowing the disk to perform read or write operations."
"in what state must the disk be in for the EXBUF_DV job command to execute the code in the job queue buffer?","The disk must be in a state where the motor is up to speed and the head is on track for the EXBUF_DV job command to execute the code in the job queue buffer, ensuring that the disk is ready for data transfer or other operations."
"what is the prerequisite for executing the code in the job queue buffer using the EXBUF_DV job command?","The prerequisite for executing the code in the job queue buffer using the EXBUF_DV job command is that the motor must be up to speed and the head must be on track, ensuring that the disk is ready for data transfer or other operations."
"what is the role of the job queue buffer in the EXBUF_DV job command?","The job queue buffer plays a crucial role in the EXBUF_DV job command as it holds the code that is executed after the motor is up to speed and the head is on track, allowing the disk to perform read or write operations."
"in what context is the EXBUF_DV job command used in a 1581 disk controller?","The EXBUF_DV job command is used in a 1581 disk controller in the context of executing code in the job queue buffer after the motor is up to speed and the head is on track, ensuring that the disk is ready for data transfer or other operations."
"what is the significance of the motor being up to speed in the EXBUF_DV job command?","The significance of the motor being up to speed in the EXBUF_DV job command is that it ensures that the disk is spinning at the correct speed, allowing the head to accurately read or write data to the disk."
"what is the purpose of the head being on track in the EXBUF_DV job command?","The purpose of the head being on track in the EXBUF_DV job command is to ensure that the read/write head is properly positioned over the desired track on the disk, allowing data to be accurately read or written."
"what happens if the motor is not up to speed or the head is not on track in the EXBUF_DV job command?","If the motor is not up to speed or the head is not on track in the EXBUF_DV job command, the code in the job queue buffer will not be executed, and the disk will not be able to perform read or write operations."
"what is the relationship between the EXBUF_DV job command and the job queue buffer?","The EXBUF_DV job command is directly related to the job queue buffer as it executes the code stored in the buffer after the motor is up to speed and the head is on track, allowing the disk to perform read or write operations."
