1581 disk: Controller commands error code 3: DOS MISMATCH (COPYRIGHT CBM DOS V10 1581)
    If  the  disk-error status is checked when the drive is first
    turned  on,  before  a  directory  or  other command has been
    given,  this message will appear.  In that use,  it is not an
    error,  but rather an easy way to see which version of DOS is
    in use. If the message appears at other times, an attempt has
    been made to write to a diskette with an incompatible format.
