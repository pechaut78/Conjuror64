1581 disk: Scratch in-depth

  SCRATCH  is  a powerful command and should be used with caution
to be sure you delete only the files you really want erased. When
using  it  with  a  pattern,  we  suggest  you first use the same
pattern in a  DIRECTORY  command,  to be sure exactly which files
will  be  deleted.  That  way you'll have no unpleasant surprises
when you use the same pattern in the SCRATCH command.
  If you accidentally SCRATCH a file you shouldn't have, there is
still  a  chance of saving it by using the "UNSCRATCH" program on
your Test/Demo diskette.

More about Splats

  Never SCRATCH a splat file.  These are files  that show up in a
directory listing with an asterisk (*)  just before the file type
for  an entry.  The asterisk (or splat) means that file was never
properly  closed,  and  thus  there  is  no valid chain of sector
links for the SCRATCH command to follow in erasing the file.
  If you  SCRATCH such a file,  odds are you will improperly free
up  sectors  that are still needed by other programs or files and
cause  permanent damage to those later when you add more files to
the  diskette.  If you find a splat file,  or if you discover too
late  that  you have scratched such a file,  immediately validate
the diskette using the  VALIDATE  command described later in this
chapter.  If  you  have  added  any  files  to the diskette since
scratching  the  splat  file,  it is best to immediately copy the
entire  diskette onto another fresh diskette,  but do this with a
copy  program  rather than with a backup program.  Otherwise, the
same problem will be recreated on the new diskette.  When the new
copy is done,  compare the number of blocks free in its directory
to  the  number  free  on  the original diskette.  If the numbers
match, no damage has been done.  If not, very likely at least one
file  on  the  diskette  has  been  corrupted,  and all should be
checked immediately.
