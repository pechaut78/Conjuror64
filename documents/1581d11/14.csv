question,answer
"What is the purpose of the VERIFY command?","To make certain that a program file was properly saved to disk."
"What does the VERIFY command compare?","Each character in the program against the equivalent character in the computer's memory."
"What happens if the disk copy of the program differs from the copy in memory?","VERIFY ERROR will be displayed, indicating that the copies differ."
"Why is there no point in trying to VERIFY a disk copy of a program after the original is no longer in memory?","Because there is nothing to compare to, an apparent error will always be announced, even though the disk copy is automatically verified as it is written to the diskette."
"What is the format for the VERIFY command?","VERIFY \"drive#:pattern\",device#,relocate flag"
"What does the 'drive#:' part of the VERIFY command format specify?","An optional drive number."
"What does the 'pattern' part of the VERIFY command format specify?","Any string expression that evaluates to a file name, with or without pattern-matching characters."
"What does the 'device#' part of the VERIFY command format specify?","The disk device number, normally 8."
"What does the 'relocate flag' part of the VERIFY command format specify?","Whether the file will be verified where originally saved, rather than relocated into the BASIC text area."
"What is an alternate form of the VERIFY command?","VERIFY \"*\",device#"
"What does the alternate form of the VERIFY command do?","Verifies the last files used without having to type its name or drive number."
"Why won't the alternate form of the VERIFY command work properly after SAVE-WITH-REPLACE?","Because the last file used was the one deleted, and the drive will try to compare the deleted file to the program in memory."
"How can you use VERIFY after @SAVE?","By including at least part of the file name that is to be verified in the pattern."
"Why will VERIFY nearly always announce an error when verifying a relocated BASIC file?","Due to changes in the link pointers of BASIC programs made during relocation."
"Why is it best to VERIFY files saved from the same type of machine and identical memory size?","Because a BASIC program saved from one machine can't be verified easily with another machine, even when the program would work fine on both machines."
