1581 disk with basic 7,0: More about Splats

  Never SCRATCH a splat file.  These are files  that show up in a
directory listing with an asterisk (*)  just before the file type
for  an entry.  The asterisk (or splat) means that file was never
properly  closed,  and  thus  there  is  no valid chain of sector
links for the  SCRATCH  command to follow in erasing the file. If
you  SCRATCH  such  a file,  odds are you will improperly free up
sectors  that  are  still  needed  by other programs or files and
cause  permanent damage to those later when you add more files to
the diskette.
  If you find a splat file,  or if you discover too late that you
have  scratched  such  a  file, immediately validate the diskette
using the COLLECT command described later in this chapter. If you
have  added  any files to the diskette since scratching the splat
file,  it  is  best  to immediately copy the entire diskette onto
another  fresh  diskette,  but do this with a copy program rather
than with a backup program.  Otherwise,  the same problem will be
recreated on the new diskette. When the new copy is done, compare
the  number of blocks free in its directory to the number free on
the  original diskette.  If the numbers match, no damage has been
done.  If not,  very likely at least one file on the diskette has
been corrupted, and all should be checked immediately.
