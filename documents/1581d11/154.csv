"what is the error code returned by the disk controller when it is unable to locate the header of a requested data block?","The error code returned by the disk controller is READ ERROR, which indicates that the controller is unable to locate the header of the requested data block, often caused by an illegal block or a header that has been destroyed, and is usually unrecoverable."
"What happens when the disk controller is unable to locate the header of a requested data block?","When the disk controller is unable to locate the header of a requested data block, it returns a READ ERROR code, indicating that the requested data block is inaccessible, often due to an illegal block or a header that has been destroyed, and the error is usually unrecoverable."
"What is the likely cause of a READ ERROR code returned by the disk controller?","The likely cause of a READ ERROR code returned by the disk controller is an illegal block or a header that has been destroyed, which prevents the controller from locating the header of the requested data block, making the error usually unrecoverable."
"What is the consequence of a destroyed header on a disk?","A destroyed header on a disk makes it impossible for the disk controller to locate the header of the requested data block, resulting in a READ ERROR code, which is usually unrecoverable."
"Can a READ ERROR code returned by the disk controller be recovered from?","Usually, a READ ERROR code returned by the disk controller is unrecoverable, meaning that the requested data block is inaccessible and cannot be recovered."
"What is the role of the disk controller in accessing data blocks?","The disk controller plays a crucial role in accessing data blocks by locating the header of the requested block, and if it fails to do so, it returns a READ ERROR code, indicating that the block is inaccessible."
"What happens when a disk controller fails to locate a block header?","When a disk controller fails to locate a block header, it returns a READ ERROR code, indicating that the requested data block is inaccessible, and the error is usually unrecoverable."
"Can an illegal block cause a READ ERROR code?","Yes, an illegal block can cause a READ ERROR code, as the disk controller is unable to locate the header of the requested data block, resulting in an unrecoverable error."
"What is the significance of the block header in disk access?","The block header is crucial in disk access as it contains essential information that allows the disk controller to locate the requested data block, and its absence or destruction can result in a READ ERROR code."
"What is the relationship between a destroyed header and a READ ERROR code?","A destroyed header is a common cause of a READ ERROR code, as the disk controller is unable to locate the header of the requested data block, resulting in an unrecoverable error."
