"what is the format for the BLOCK-FREE command?","The format for the BLOCK-FREE command is PRINT#15,\"BLOCK-FREE\";drive#;track#;sector#, where drive# is the drive number, and track# and sector# are the track and sector numbers containing the desired block of data to be freed."
"what is the abbreviated format for the BLOCK-FREE command?","The abbreviated format for the BLOCK-FREE command is PRINT#15,\"B-F\";drive#;track#;sector#, which is a shorter version of the full format."
"how do you specify the drive, track, and sector numbers in the BLOCK-FREE command?","You specify the drive, track, and sector numbers in the BLOCK-FREE command by replacing drive#, track#, and sector# with the actual numbers, for example, PRINT#15,\"B-F\";0;1;1 would free the sector on drive 0, track 1, sector 1."
"what happens to the data on the sector when you use the BLOCK-FREE command?","When you use the BLOCK-FREE command, the data on the sector is not erased, but the sector is marked as available for re-use by the DOS, and the BAM is updated to reflect this change."
"can you use the BLOCK-FREE command to erase data from a sector?","No, the BLOCK-FREE command does not erase data from a sector, it only marks the sector as available for re-use by the DOS, and updates the BAM accordingly."
"what is the purpose of updating the BAM when using the BLOCK-FREE command?","Updating the BAM when using the BLOCK-FREE command ensures that the DOS is aware that the sector is available for re-use, and can allocate it to a new file or block of data."
"what is the difference between the BLOCK-FREE command and the BLOCK-ALLOCATE command?","The BLOCK-FREE command frees a block that is no longer needed, making it available for re-use by the DOS, whereas the BLOCK-ALLOCATE command allocates a block for use by a file or program."
"how do you free a sector that was previously allocated using the BLOCK-ALLOCATE command?","You can free a sector that was previously allocated using the BLOCK-ALLOCATE command by using the BLOCK-FREE command, specifying the drive, track, and sector numbers of the sector to be freed."
