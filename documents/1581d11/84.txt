1581 disk:  FREEING BLOCKS

  The  BLOCK-FREE  command is the opposite of  BLOCK-ALLOCATE. It
frees  a  block  that you don't need any more,  for re-use by the
DOS.  BLOCK-FREE  updates  the BAM to show a particular sector is
not in use, rather than actually erasing any data.

FORMAT FOR BLOCK-FREE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,"BLOCK-FREE";drive#;track#;sector#

abbreviated as: PRINT#15,"B-F";drive#;track#;sector#

where  "drive#" is the drive number,  and  "track#" and "sector#"
are  respectively  the  track  and  sector numbers containing the
desired block of data to be read into the file buffer.

ALTERNATE FORMAT:

  PRINT#15,"B-F:";drive#;track#;sector#

EXAMPLE:

  To  free  the  sector  in which we wrote our name in the BLOCK-
WRITE example, and allocated in the first BLOCK-ALLOCATE example,
we could use the following command:

  PRINT#15,"B-F";0;1;1
