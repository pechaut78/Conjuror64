This is a special flag that is set by setting bit 6 of the file-type byte in the directory entry."
"how can you erase a locked file on a C64 disk?","To erase a locked file on a C64 disk, you need to use a disk monitor to clear bit 6 of the file-type byte in the directory entry on the diskette. This will remove the lock and allow the file to be erased with the SCRATCH command."
