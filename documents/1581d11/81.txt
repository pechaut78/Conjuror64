1581 disk:  THE ORIGINAL BLOCK-READ AND BLOCK-WRITE COMMANDS

  Although  the  BLOCK-READ  and  BLOCK-WRITE commands are nearly
always  replaced  by  the  U1  and  U2 commands respectively, the
original  commands  can  still  be  used,  as  long  as you fully
understand their effects. Unlike U1 and U2, B-R and B-W allow you
to read or write less than a full sector. In the case of B-R, the
first  byte  of  the  selected  sector  is used to set the buffer
pointer (see next section), and determines how many bytes of that
sector are read into a disk memory buffer. A program may check to
be sure it  doesn't attempt to read past the end of data actually
loaded  into  the  buffer,  by watching for the value of the file
status  variable  ST  to change from 0 to 64.  When the buffer is
written  back  to diskette by B-W,  the first byte written is the
current  value  of  the buffer pointer.  Only that many bytes are
written into the specified sector. B-R and B-W may thus be useful
in working with custom-designed file structures.

FORMAT FOR THE ORIGINAL BLOCK-READ AND BLOCK-WRITE COMMANDS:

  PRINT#15,"BLOCK-READ";channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

abbreviated as: PRINT#15,"B-R";channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

and

  PRINT#15,"BLOCK-WRITE";channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

abbreviated as: PRINT#15,"B-W";channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

where  "channel#"  is  the channel number specified when the file
into  which  the  block will be read was opened,  "drive#" is the
drive number, and "track#" and "sector#" are the track and sector
numbers containing the desired block of data to be partially read
into or written from the file buffer.


|   In a true BLOCK-READ, the first byte of the selected sector |
| is  used  to  determine how many bytes of that sector to read |
| into the disk  memory buffer.  It thus cannot be used to read |
| an entire sector  into the buffer,  as the first data byte is |
| always  interpreted  as  being  number of characters to read, |
| rather than part of the data.                                 |
|   Similarly,  in  a  true  BLOCK-WRITE,  when  the  buffer is |
| written  back  to  diskette,  the  first  byte written is the |
| current value of the  buffer  pointer.  Only  that many bytes |
| are written into the specified  sector.  It cannot be used to |
| rewrite an entire sector onto diskette unchanged, because the |
| first data byte is overwritten by the buffer pointer.         |
