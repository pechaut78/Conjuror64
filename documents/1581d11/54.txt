1581 disk with basic 7,0: FORMAT FOR THE INPUT# STATEMENT:

  INPUT#file#,variable list

where "file#" is the same file number given in the desired file's
current OPEN statement,  and "variable list" is one or more valid
BASIC  variable  names.  If  more  than one data element is to be
input  by a particular INPUT# statement,  each variable name must
be separated from others by a comma.

EXAMPLES:

To read back in the grades written with the PRINT# example, use:

  300 FOR CLASS = 1 TO COURSES
  310 INPUT#1,GRADE$(CLASS)
  320 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS
  330 NEXT CLASS

assuming your program includes an error check subroutine like the
one in the last chapter.
  To  read  back  in  the  address data written by another PRINT#
example, it is safest to use:

  800 INPUT#5,NAME$
  810 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS
  820 INPUT#5,STREET$
  830 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS
  840 INPUT#5,CITY$
  850 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS

but many programs cheat on safety a bit and use

  800 INPUT#5,NAME$,STREET$,CITY$
  810 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS

This  is  done  primarily  when  top  speed  in  the  program  is
essential, and there is little risk of reading improper data from
the file.
