1581 disk:  SCRATCH

  The SCRATCH command allows you to erase unwanted files and free
the space they occupied for use by other files. It can be used to
erase either a single file  or several files at once via pattern-
matching.

FORMAT FOR THE SCRATCH COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,"SCRATCH0:pattern"

or abbreviate it as:

  PRINT#15,"S0:pattern"

"pattern"  can  be any file name or combination of characters and
wildcard characters.  As usual, it is assumed the command channel
has  already  been  opened  as  file 15.  Although not absolutely
necessary,  it  is  best  to  include the drive number in SCRATCH
commands.
  If  you  check  the  error channel after a SCRATCH command, the
value  for  ET  (error  track)  will tell you how many files were
scratched.  For example,  if your diskette contains program files
named  "TEST",  "TRAIN",  "TRUCK" and "TAIL", you may SCRATCH all
four,  along  with any other files beginning with the letter "T",
by using the command:

  PRINT#15,"S0:T*"

Then, to prove they are gone, you can type:

  GOSUB 59990

to  call  the  error  checking  subroutine  given earlier in this
chapter.  If  the  four listed were the only files beginning with
"T", you will see:

  01, FILES SCRATCHED,04,00
  READY.

The "04" tells you 4 files were scratched.
