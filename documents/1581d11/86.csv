"what is the purpose of combining commands in this chapter","By combining the commands in this chapter, it is possible to develop a file-handling program that uses random files, which enables the creation of a program that can efficiently manage and store data on a disk."
"how do you keep track of used blocks on a disk for a random file","You need to keep track of which blocks on the disk a random file has used, and also ensure that a sector hasn't been allocated by another unrelated file on the diskette, by using a sequential file to store a list of record numbers, with the track, sector, and byte location of each record."
"what is the common way to record used sectors for a random file","The most common way of recording which sectors have been used by a random file is in a sequential file, which stores a list of record numbers, with the track, sector, and byte location of each record."
"what are the three channels needed by a random file","A random file needs three channels: one for the command channel, one for the random data, and the last for the sequential data."
"what is the purpose of a sequential file in a random file system","A sequential file is used to store a list of record numbers, with the track, sector, and byte location of each record, which helps to keep track of which sectors have been used by a random file."
"how do you ensure that a sector hasn't been allocated by another file","You must also be sure that a sector hasn't been allocated by another unrelated file on the diskette, in addition to knowing that a sector has not been allocated by your random file."
"what is the advantage of using a sequential file in a random file system","The advantage of using a sequential file is that it enables efficient management of random files by keeping track of which sectors have been used, and ensures that sectors are not allocated by multiple files."
"what is the relationship between a random file and a sequential file","A random file uses a sequential file to store a list of record numbers, with the track, sector, and byte location of each record, which helps to manage the random file."
"how do you manage random files on a disk","You can manage random files on a disk by using a sequential file to keep track of which sectors have been used, and ensuring that sectors are not allocated by multiple files."
"what is the importance of tracking used sectors in a random file system","Tracking used sectors is important in a random file system because it ensures that sectors are not allocated by multiple files, and enables efficient management of random files."
