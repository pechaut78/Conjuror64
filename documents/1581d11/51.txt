1581 disk with basic 7,0: CLOSING A FILE

  After you finish using a data file,  it  is extremely important
that you CLOSE it.  During the process of writing a file, data is
accumulated  in  a  memory  buffer,  and  only written out to the
diskette when the buffer fills.
  Working this way, there is almost always a small amount of data
in  the  buffer  that  has  not been written to diskette yet, and
which would simply be lost if the computer system were tuned off.
Similarly,  there  are  diskette  housekeeping  matters,  such as
updating the BAM  (Block Availability Map) of sectors used by the
current file,  which are not performed during the ordinary course
of  writing  a  file.  This  is  the  reason  for  having a CLOSE
statement.  When  you  are done with a file,  the CLOSE statement
will  write  the  rest of the data buffer out to diskette, update
the  BAM,  and complete the file's entry in the directory. Always
close  a  data file when you are done using it.  Failure to do so
may cause loss of the entire file.
  However,  do not close the disk command channel until all other
files  have been closed.  The command channel should be the first
file opened, and the last file closed in any program.
