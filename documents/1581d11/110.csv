"what is the purpose of the send-cmd-string command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The send-cmd-string command is used to send one byte of a command to determine whether the drive is fast or slow. This command is essential in establishing communication with the 1581 disk drive and determining its operational mode."
"what is the function of the toggle-clock command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The toggle-clock command is used to change the state of the clock line. This command is used in conjunction with other commands to control the flow of data and commands between the computer and the 1581 disk drive."
"what happens when the set-clock-high command is executed in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","When the set-clock-high command is executed, it changes the state of the clock to logic 1. This command is used to control the clock signal, which is essential for synchronizing data transfer between the computer and the 1581 disk drive."
"what is the purpose of the wait-byte command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The wait-byte command is used to poll the 8520 for a byte ready. This command is used to wait for the 8520 to indicate that it is ready to receive or transmit data."
"what is the function of the read-error command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The read-error command calls toggle-clock and wait-byte, and then returns to the main routine if there are no errors. This command is used to handle errors that may occur during data transfer between the computer and the 1581 disk drive."
"what is the purpose of the store-data command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The store-data command is used to store data in a particular memory location. This command is used to store data that has been read from or written to the 1581 disk drive."
"what is the function of the last-byte command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The last-byte command is used to increment and compare a value to the sector size, depending on the sector size. This command is used to keep track of the current position within a sector on the 1581 disk drive."
"what is the purpose of the serial-in command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The serial-in command is used to set the 8520 serial port and driver circuit to input mode. This command is used to configure the 8520 for receiving data from the 1581 disk drive."
"what is the function of the read-err command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The read-err command calls wait-byte and evaluates the status of the previous controller job. This command is used to check for errors that may have occurred during the previous data transfer operation."
"what is the purpose of the write-1581 command in the 1581 disk drive protocol?","The write-1581 command is used to send a typical unit write to a 1581. This command is used to write data to the 1581 disk drive."
