1581 disk:  USER COMMANDS

  Most  USER commands are intended to be used as machine language
JMP  or  BASIC  SYS  commands  to  machine language programs that
reside inside the disk memory.  However,  some of them have other
uses  as  well.  The USER1 and USER2 commands are used to replace
the  BLOCK-READ  and BLOCK- WRITE commands, UI re-starts the 1581
without  changing many variables,  UJ cold-starts the 1581 almost
as if it had been turned off and on again.

USER Command                       Function
-----------------------------------------------------------------
U0                     restores default user jump table
U0 + (CMD)             burst utility command
                       (see Chapter 9 Burst Commands)
U1 or UA               block read replacement
U2 or UB               block write replacement
U3 or UC               jump to $0500
U4 or UD               jump to $0503
U5 or UE               jump to $0506
U6 or UF               jump to $0509
U7 or UG               jump to $050C
U8 or UH               jump to $050F
U9 or UI               jump to ($FFFA) reset tables
U: or UJ               power up vector
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  By loading these memory locations with another machine language
JMP  command,  such as JMP $0520,  you can create longer routines
that  operate in the disk's memory along with an easy-to-use jump
table.

FORMAT FOR USER COMMANDS:

  PRINT#15,"Ucharacter";

where  "character" defines one of the preset user commands listed
above.

EXAMPLES:

  PRINT#15,"U:";             Form of DOS RESET command
  PRINT#15,"U3";             Execute program at start of buffer 2
