"what is the purpose of the original BLOCK-READ and BLOCK-WRITE commands","Although the BLOCK-READ and BLOCK-WRITE commands are nearly always replaced by the U1 and U2 commands respectively, the original commands can still be used, as long as you fully understand their effects."
"what is the difference between BLOCK-READ and U1 commands","Unlike U1 and U2, B-R and B-W allow you to read or write less than a full sector."
"what happens when the buffer is written back to diskette by B-W","When the buffer is written back to diskette by B-W, the first byte written is the current value of the buffer pointer."
"what is the use of the first byte of the selected sector in BLOCK-READ","The first byte of the selected sector is used to set the buffer pointer, and determines how many bytes of that sector are read into a disk memory buffer."
"how can a program check if it doesn't attempt to read past the end of data actually loaded into the buffer","A program may check to be sure it doesn't attempt to read past the end of data actually loaded into the buffer, by watching for the value of the file status variable ST to change from 0 to 64."
"what is the format of the original BLOCK-READ command","PRINT#15,"BLOCK-READ";channel#;drive#;track#;sector# or abbreviated as: PRINT#15,"B-R";channel#;drive#;track#;sector#"
"what is the format of the original BLOCK-WRITE command","PRINT#15,"BLOCK-WRITE";channel#;drive#;track#;sector# or abbreviated as: PRINT#15,"B-W";channel#;drive#;track#;sector#"
"in a true BLOCK-READ, what is the first byte of the selected sector used for","In a true BLOCK-READ, the first byte of the selected sector is used to determine how many bytes of that sector to read into the disk memory buffer."
"in a true BLOCK-WRITE, what is the first byte written","In a true BLOCK-WRITE, when the buffer is written back to diskette, the first byte written is the current value of the buffer pointer."
"why can't BLOCK-READ be used to read an entire sector into the buffer","It cannot be used to read an entire sector into the buffer, as the first data byte is always interpreted as being number of characters to read, rather than part of the data."
"why can't BLOCK-WRITE be used to rewrite an entire sector onto diskette unchanged","It cannot be used to rewrite an entire sector onto diskette unchanged, because the first data byte is overwritten by the buffer pointer."
"what is the advantage of using BLOCK-READ and BLOCK-WRITE commands","B-R and B-W may thus be useful in working with custom-designed file structures."
"what is the channel# in the BLOCK-READ and BLOCK-WRITE commands","The channel# is the channel number specified when the file into which the block will be read was opened."
"what is the drive# in the BLOCK-READ and BLOCK-WRITE commands","The drive# is the drive number."
"what is the track# and sector# in the BLOCK-READ and BLOCK-WRITE commands","The track# and sector# are the track and sector numbers containing the desired block of data to be partially read into or written from the file buffer."
"what is the purpose of the file status variable ST","The file status variable ST is used to check if the program doesn't attempt to read past the end of data actually loaded into the buffer."
"when does the value of the file status variable ST change","The value of the file status variable ST changes from 0 to 64 when the buffer is written back to diskette by B-W."
"what happens when the value of the file status variable ST changes","When the value of the file status variable ST changes from 0 to 64, it indicates that the buffer is written back to diskette by B-W."
"what is the difference between B-R and U1 commands in terms of reading data","B-R allows you to read less than a full sector, whereas U1 does not have this capability."
"what is the difference between B-W and U2 commands in terms of writing data","B-W allows you to write less than a full sector, whereas U2 does not have this capability."
"what is the purpose of the buffer pointer in BLOCK-READ and BLOCK-WRITE commands","The buffer pointer is used to determine how many bytes of the sector are read into or written from the file buffer."
"what is the role of the first byte of the selected sector in BLOCK-WRITE","The first byte of the selected sector is used to determine how many bytes of that sector are written into the file buffer."
