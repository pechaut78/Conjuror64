"what is the purpose of the SEEK_DV job command in a 1581 disk controller?","The SEEK_DV job command is used to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller. This command requires the current physical track position to be specified in the track parameter of HDRS."
"what is the HDRS parameter used for in the SEEK_DV job command?","The HDRS parameter is used to specify the current physical track position in the SEEK_DV job command, which is necessary to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller."
"what is the track parameter in HDRS used for in the SEEK_DV job command?","The track parameter in HDRS is used to specify the current physical track position, which is required by the SEEK_DV job command to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller."
"what is the syntax of the SEEK_DV job command?","The syntax of the SEEK_DV job command is $8C, which is used to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller, requiring the current physical track position to be specified in the track parameter of HDRS."
"what is the purpose of the $8C code in the SEEK_DV job command?","The $8C code is the syntax of the SEEK_DV job command, which is used to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller, requiring the current physical track position to be specified in the track parameter of HDRS."
"in what context is the SEEK_DV job command used?","The SEEK_DV job command is used in the context of a 1581 disk controller, specifically to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on the disk."
"what is the relationship between the SEEK_DV job command and the physical track position?","The SEEK_DV job command is used to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller, and it requires the current physical track position to be specified in the track parameter of HDRS."
"what is the significance of the physical track position in the SEEK_DV job command?","The physical track position is significant in the SEEK_DV job command because it determines the particular physical track (cylinder) that the disk controller will seek to on a 1581 disk controller."
"how does the SEEK_DV job command interact with the HDRS parameter?","The SEEK_DV job command interacts with the HDRS parameter by using the track parameter in HDRS to specify the current physical track position, which is necessary to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller."
"what is the role of the track parameter in the SEEK_DV job command?","The track parameter in the SEEK_DV job command is used to specify the current physical track position, which is necessary to seek to a particular physical track (cylinder) on a 1581 disk controller."
