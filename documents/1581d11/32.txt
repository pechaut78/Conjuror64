1581 disk with basic 7,0:FORMAT FOR THE DVERIFY COMMAND:

  DVERIFY "file name"[,Ddrive#][,Udevice#]

  The  following  version of the command verifies a file that was
just saved:

  DVERIFY"*"

  This  command  won't  work  properly  after  SAVE-WITH-REPLACE,
because  the  last  file used was the one deleted,  and the drive
will try to compare the deleted file to the program in memory. No
harm will result, but "VERIFY ERROR" will always be announced. To
use  DVERIFY after @SAVE,  include at least part of the file name
that is to be verified in the pattern.
