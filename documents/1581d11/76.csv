"what is the purpose of using sequential and relative files together?","The purpose of using sequential and relative files together is to enable efficient data retrieval and manipulation. The sequential file is used to store brief records of names, which can be read into a string array and sorted alphabetically. This allows for the use of a binary search to quickly find an entered name in the array, and subsequently read or write the associated record in the relative file."
"how can the contents of a sequential file be utilized?","The contents of a sequential file can be read into a string array and sorted alphabetically, enabling the use of a binary search to quickly find an entered name in the array."
"what is the benefit of using a binary search?","The benefit of using a binary search is that it allows for quick location of an entered name in the array, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation."
"what is the role of the sequential file in the context of index files?","The sequential file is used to keep brief records of which name in the relative file is stored in each record number, allowing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation."
"how can multiple index files be maintained?","Advanced programs can maintain two or more index files, sorted in differing ways simultaneously, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation."
"what is the advantage of sorting the contents of a sequential file?","The advantage of sorting the contents of a sequential file is that it enables the use of a binary search to quickly find an entered name in the array, and subsequently read or write the associated record in the relative file."
"in what way can the relative file be accessed?","The relative file can be accessed by reading or writing the associated record in the relative file, based on the entered name found in the sequential file."
"what is the purpose of storing brief records of names in a sequential file?","The purpose of storing brief records of names in a sequential file is to enable efficient data retrieval and manipulation, by allowing for the use of a binary search to quickly find an entered name in the array."
"how can the efficiency of data retrieval be improved?","The efficiency of data retrieval can be improved by using a binary search to quickly find an entered name in the array, and subsequently read or write the associated record in the relative file."
"what is the relationship between the sequential file and the relative file?","The sequential file is used to store brief records of names, which are used to access the associated records in the relative file, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation."
