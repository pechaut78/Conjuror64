"what is the purpose of the sequential file bit in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","The sequential file bit, represented by 'P', indicates whether a file is a sequential file or not. If 'P' is set to 1, it means the file is not a program file and is likely a sequential file. This bit is important in the FASTLOAD UTILITY as it determines how the file is handled during the loading process."
"what is the function of the X bits in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","The X bits in the FASTLOAD UTILITY are 'don't care' bits, meaning they can be either 0 or 1 without affecting the functionality of the utility. They are used as placeholders in the byte layout and do not have any specific function in the protocol."
"what is the purpose of the burst handshake in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","The burst handshake is a protocol used in the FASTLOAD UTILITY to facilitate fast data transfer. It is a synchronization mechanism that ensures the receiver is ready to receive data before the sender starts transmitting. This handshake is essential for reliable and efficient data transfer."
"what is the format of the status byte in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","The status byte in the FASTLOAD UTILITY is an 8-bit byte that provides information about the status of the data transfer. The format is as follows: BIT 7-1: status information, BIT 0: X (don't care). The status information can have different values, including 0000000X for OK, 00000010 for file not found, and 00011111 for EOI (end of input)."
"what happens when the status byte has a value between 3 and 15 in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","If the status byte has a value between 3 and 15, it indicates a file read error. This means that there was an issue with reading the file, and the transfer was not successful. The exact cause of the error may vary depending on the specific value of the status byte."
"what is the significance of the EOI status byte in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","The EOI (end of input) status byte, represented by 00011111, indicates the end of the data transfer. It is followed by a byte that specifies the number of data bytes to follow. This is an important indicator that the data transfer is complete and the receiver can process the received data."
"how does the FASTLOAD UTILITY handle file names?","The FASTLOAD UTILITY stores file names in byte 03 of the protocol. This byte contains the actual file name, which is used to identify the file being transferred."
"what is the purpose of the burst status byte in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","The burst status byte is a byte that precedes each sector transferred in the FASTLOAD UTILITY. It provides information about the status of the data transfer, including any errors that may have occurred. This byte is essential for ensuring reliable data transfer and detecting any issues that may arise during the transfer process."
"what is the format of the byte layout in the FASTLOAD UTILITY?","The byte layout in the FASTLOAD UTILITY consists of 4 bytes, each with a specific function. Byte 00 contains the sequential file bit and other flags, byte 01 contains additional flags, byte 02 contains the file name, and byte 03 contains the actual file name."
"how does the FASTLOAD UTILITY handle errors during data transfer?","The FASTLOAD UTILITY handles errors during data transfer by using the status byte to indicate the type of error that occurred. The status byte can have different values, including 00000010 for file not found, and values between 3 and 15 for file read errors. This allows the receiver to take appropriate action in response to the error."
