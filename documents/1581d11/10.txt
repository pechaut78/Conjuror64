1581 disk:  One  disk  error  message  is  not  always an error. Error 73,
"COPYRIGHT CBM DOS V10 1581"  will  appear  if  you read the disk
error  channel  before sending any disk commands when you turn on
your computer.  This is a handy way to check which version of DOS
you  are  using.  However,  if  this message appears later, after
other disk commands, it means there is a mismatch between the DOS
used  to  format  your diskette and the DOS in your drive. DOS is
Disk Operating System.
