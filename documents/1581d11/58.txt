1581 disk with basic 7,0: COMMAS (,) AND COLONS (:)

  commas  and colons can cause trouble in a
file,  because they delimit  (end) the data element in which they
appear  and cause any remaining characters in the data element to
be read into the next INPUT# variable.  They have the same effect
in an INPUT statement,  causing the common  "EXTRA IGNORED" error
message.  However,  sometimes  you  really  need a comma or colon
within a data element,  such as a name written as  "Last, First".
The cure  is to precede such data elements with a quotation mark.
After a quotation mark,  in either an  INPUT or INPUT# statement,
all   other  characters  except  a  carriage  return  or  another
quotation mark are accepted as part of the current data element.

EXAMPLES:

  To force a quotation mark into a data element  going to a file,
append a CHR$(34) to the start of the data element. For example:

  PRINT#2,CHR$(34)+"DOE,JOHN"

or

  PRINT#2,CHR$(34);"DOE,JOHN"

If  you  do  this  often,  some  space  and time may be saved by
previously  defining  a  variable as equal to CHR$(34) as we did
earlier with CHR$(13):

   20 QT$=CHR$(34)
  ...
  400 PRINT#5,QT$+NAME$

  In  each  case,  the added quotation mark will be stripped from
the data  by the  INPUT  or  INPUT#  statement,  but the comma or
colon will remain part of the data.
