question,answer
"What is the purpose of the COLLECT command?","The COLLECT command recalculates the Block Availability Map (BAM) of the current diskette, allocating only those sectors still being used by valid, properly closed files and programs."
"What happens to improperly closed files during COLLECT?","All improperly closed files are automatically scratched."
"When is COLLECT needed?","COLLECT is needed when the blocks used by the files on a diskette plus the blocks shown as free don't add up to the 3160 available on a fresh diskette."
"How can you identify an improperly closed file?","An improperly closed file is indicated by an asterisk (*) next to its file type in the directory."
"What should you do after using COLLECT?","You should note the number of blocks free in the diskette's directory before and after using COLLECT."
"What if the block totals differ before and after COLLECT?","If the totals differ, there was indeed a problem, and the diskette should probably be copied onto a fresh diskette file-by-file."
"Why should you avoid using COLLECT on certain diskettes?","COLLECT should not be used on diskettes containing direct access files, as it may result in unallocating all direct access files and loss of their contents."
"What is the exception to using COLLECT?","The exception is diskettes containing direct access files, which should not be collected."
"What is the format for the COLLECT command?","The format for the COLLECT command is COLLECT [,Ddrive#][,Udevice#]>."
"What does COLLECT do to the Block Availability Map?","COLLECT recalculates the Block Availability Map (BAM) of the current diskette."
"How does COLLECT allocate sectors?","COLLECT allocates only those sectors still being used by valid, properly closed files and programs."
"What happens to unused sectors during COLLECT?","All other sectors (blocks) are left unallocated and free for re-use."
"What is the benefit of using COLLECT?","COLLECT can restore to good health many diskettes whose directories or Block Availability Maps have become muddled."
"When should you use COLLECT?","You should use COLLECT whenever you are concerned about the integrity of a diskette."
"How does COLLECT handle direct access files?","COLLECT may unallocate all direct access files, resulting in loss of their contents when other files are added."
"What should you do with a diskette that needs COLLECT?","You should copy the diskette onto a fresh diskette file-by-file using a copy program."
"Why is COLLECT important?","COLLECT is important for maintaining the integrity of diskettes and preventing data loss."
"What is the result of using COLLECT on a diskette with an improperly closed file?","The improperly closed file is automatically scratched."
"How does COLLECT affect the directory?","COLLECT updates the directory to reflect the new block allocation."
"What is the relationship between COLLECT and the Block Availability Map?","COLLECT recalculates the Block Availability Map (BAM) of the current diskette."
"When is COLLECT not needed?","COLLECT is not needed if the blocks used by the files on a diskette plus the blocks shown as free add up to the 3160 available on a fresh diskette."
"What happens to valid files during COLLECT?","Valid files are preserved and their sectors are allocated during COLLECT."
"What is the purpose of recalculating the Block Availability Map?","The purpose of recalculating the Block Availability Map is to allocate only those sectors still being used by valid, properly closed files and programs."
"How does COLLECT handle relative files?","COLLECT may be used on relative files without difficulty."
"What is the difference between direct access files and relative files?","Direct access files do not allocate their sectors in a way COLLECT can recognize, whereas relative files can be collected without difficulty."
"What is the risk of using COLLECT on a diskette with direct access files?","The risk is that COLLECT may unallocate all direct access files, resulting in loss of their contents."
"Why should you avoid using COLLECT on diskettes with direct access files?","You should avoid using COLLECT on diskettes with direct access files because it may result in loss of data."
"What is the benefit of using COLLECT regularly?","Regular use of COLLECT can help maintain the integrity of diskettes and prevent data loss."
"How does COLLECT affect diskette performance?","COLLECT can improve diskette performance by freeing up unused sectors and allocating them efficiently."
