1581 disk Controller Job commands: READ_DV
       $80     Reads  a particular logical sector into the
                      job queue buffer  (only if the disk has not
                      been  changed).  If  the  desired sector is
                      already in the track cache buffer,  then no
                      disk  activity  is  required  (the  data is
                      merely  transferred  from  the  track cache
                      memory to the job queue buffer memory).  If
                      the  desired  sector  is  not  in the track
                      cache,  then  the  current  track  cache is
                      dumped  to  disk   (only  if  it  has  been
                      modified),  the  desired track is read into
                      the track cache, and finally the particular
                      sector's data is transferred from the track
                      cache memory to the job queue buffer.
