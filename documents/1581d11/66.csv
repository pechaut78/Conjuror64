"what is the purpose of creating several records when opening a relative file for the first time?","Creating several records when opening a relative file for the first time is necessary to save time when using the file later and to assure that the file will work reliably. It is recommended to create as many records as the program is eventually expected to use, which has the additional benefit of avoiding problems such as running out of room on the diskette before the entire file is completed."
"what happens if you start writing data to a just-opened relative file without specifying a record number?","If you start writing data to a just-opened relative file without specifying a record number, it will act like a sequential file, putting the data elements written by the first PRINT# statement in record #1, those written by the second PRINT# statement in record #2 and so on."
"what is the benefit of using the RECORD# command when writing to a relative file?","The benefit of using the RECORD# command when writing to a relative file is that it allows you to access records in any desired order, hopping anywhere in a file with equal ease."
"why is it recommended to write more than two disk sectors (512 bytes) to a relative file when opening it for the first time?","It is recommended to write more than two disk sectors (512 bytes) to a relative file when opening it for the first time to assure that the file will work reliably and to save time when using the file later."
"how do you specify which record to write to in a relative file?","You specify which record to write to in a relative file by using the RECORD# command, which allows you to access records in any desired order."
"what is the difference between writing to a relative file with and without specifying a record number?","When writing to a relative file without specifying a record number, the file acts like a sequential file, whereas when specifying a record number using the RECORD# command, you can access records in any desired order."
"why is it important to create enough records in a relative file to fill more than two disk sectors?","Creating enough records in a relative file to fill more than two disk sectors (512 bytes) is important to assure that the file will work reliably and to save time when using the file later."
"how do you separate fields when writing to a relative file?","You separate fields when writing to a relative file by using embedded carriage returns within the data to separate fields that will be read in via one or more INPUT# statements later."
"what is the advantage of creating as many records as the program is eventually expected to use?","The advantage of creating as many records as the program is eventually expected to use is that it avoids problems such as running out of room on the diskette before the entire file is completed."
"why is it better to explicitly specify which record number is desired when writing to a relative file?","It is better to explicitly specify which record number is desired when writing to a relative file because it allows you to access records in any desired order, hopping anywhere in a file with equal ease."
