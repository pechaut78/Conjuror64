1581 disk with basic 7,0:FORMAT FOR A MONITOR SAVE:

  S "drive#:file name",device#,starting address,ending address+1

where "drive#:" is the drive number,  0 on the 1581;  "file name"
is any valid file name up to 14 characters long  (16 if you leave
out the drive# and the colon that follows it); "device#" is a two
digit device number,  normally  08 on the 1581  (the leading 0 is
required); and the addresses to be saved are given in Hexadecimal
(base 16), but without a leading dollar sign (for the Plus/4). On
the C128, the addresses need not be in Hexadecimal. Note that the
ending address listed must be 1 location beyond the last location
to be saved.
