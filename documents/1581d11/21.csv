"What is the purpose of the VALIDATE command?","The purpose of the VALIDATE command is to recalculate the Block Availability Map (BAM) of the current diskette, allocating only those sectors still being used by valid, properly-closed files and programs, and leaving all other sectors unallocated and free for re-use."
"What happens to improperly closed files when the VALIDATE command is used?","When the VALIDATE command is used, all improperly closed files are automatically scratched, and their sectors are left unallocated and free for re-use."
"When is it necessary to use the VALIDATE command?","It is necessary to use the VALIDATE command when the blocks used by the files on a diskette plus the blocks shown as free do not add up to the 3160 available on a fresh diskette, or when a diskette contains an improperly-closed file (splat file), indicated by an asterisk (*) next to its file type in the directory."
"What is the exception to using the VALIDATE command?","The exception to using the VALIDATE command is on diskettes containing direct access files, as the command may result in unallocating all direct access files, with loss of all their contents when other files are added."
"How does the VALIDATE command affect direct access files?","The VALIDATE command may unallocate all direct access files, resulting in the loss of all their contents when other files are added, and therefore should not be used on diskettes containing direct access files unless specifically instructed otherwise."
"What is the benefit of using the VALIDATE command?","The benefit of using the VALIDATE command is that it can restore to good health many diskettes whose directories or block availability maps have become muddled."
"How does the VALIDATE command determine which sectors to allocate?","The VALIDATE command determines which sectors to allocate by recalculating the Block Availability Map (BAM) of the current diskette, allocating only those sectors still being used by valid, properly-closed files and programs."
"What happens to sectors that are not allocated by the VALIDATE command?","Sectors that are not allocated by the VALIDATE command are left unallocated and free for re-use."
"When should the VALIDATE command be used as a precautionary measure?","The VALIDATE command should be used as a precautionary measure whenever you are the least bit concerned about the integrity of a diskette, except in the case of diskettes containing direct access files."
"What is the result of using the VALIDATE command on a diskette with an improperly-closed file?","The result of using the VALIDATE command on a diskette with an improperly-closed file is that the file will be automatically scratched, and its sectors will be left unallocated and free for re-use."
