1581 disk: INITIALIZE

  When  a  diskette is inserted into the drive,  its directory is
automatically  re-read  into  a  disk  buffer.  You would use the
command only if that information became unreliable.

FORMAT FOR THE INITIALIZE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,"INITIALIZEdrive#"

or it may be abbreviated to

  PRINT#15,"Idrive#"

EXAMPLE:

  PRINT#15,"I0"

  PRINT#15,"INITIALIZE0"

where the command channel is assumed to be opened by file 15, and
"drive#" is 0.
