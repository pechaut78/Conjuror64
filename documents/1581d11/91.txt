1581 disk:  MEMORY-WRITE

  The  MEMORY-WRITE  command is the equivalent of the  BASIC POKE
command,  but has its effect in disk memory instead of within the
computer.  M-W  allows you to write up to 35 bytes at a time into
disk  memory.  The  MEMORY-EXECUTE  and some USER commands can be
used to run any programs written this way:

FORMAT FOR THE MEMORY-WRITE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,"M-W"CHR$(<address)CHR$(>address)CHR$(# of bytes)
           CHR$(data byte(s))

where  "<address"  is the low order part,  and  ">address" is the
high order part of the address  in disk memory  to begin writing,
"# of bytes"  is  the  number  of  memory  locations that will be
written (from 1-35),  and "data byte" is 1 or more byte values to
be written into disk memory, each as a CHR$() value.

EXAMPLES:

We  can  use  this line to turn off the "bumps" when loading DOS-
protected  programs  (i.e.,  programs  that  have  been protected
against  being  copied by creating and checking for specific disk
errors).

  PRINT#15,"M-W"CHR$(48)CHR$(0)CHR$(1)CHR$(133)

  The following line can be used to recover bad sectors,  such as
when  an  important  file  has  been  damaged  and cannot be read
normally:

  PRINT#15,"M-W"CHR$(48)CHR$(0)CHR$(1)CHR$(31)

  These two examples may be very useful under some circumstances.
They   are   the   equivalent   of   POKE 48,133  and  POKE 48,31
respectively,  but  in  disk memory,  not inside the computer. As
mentioned in the previous section's first example, location 48 in
the  1581  disk  drive  signifies  two separate activities to the
drive,  all related to error recovery.  Bit 7  (the high bit), if
set means no  "bumps"  (don't move the read head to track 1). The
bottom six bits are the count of how many times the disk will try
to  read  each  sector  before  and  after trying seeks and bumps
before  giving  up.  Since  31  is the largest number that can be
expressed  in  six  bits,  that  is  the  maximum number of tries
allowed.
  From this example,  you  can see the value of knowing something
about  PEEKS,  POKES,  and  machine-language before using direct-
access disk commands, as well as their potential power.
