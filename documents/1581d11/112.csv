"How does the 1581 disk format its data internally?","The 1581 formats its data internally as a double sided disk with 80 tracks per side, and 10 x 512 byte sectors per track, which is different from the logical format presented to the host computer."
"What is the logical format of the 1581 disk?","The logical format of the 1581 disk is a single sided disk with 80 tracks, and 40 x 256 byte sectors per track, which is the format presented to the host computer through the DOS interface."
"How does the 1581 handle the translation between logical and physical formats?","The 1581 has software that automatically takes care of the logical to physical translations necessary to retrieve the data properly from the disk, allowing the host computer to interact with the disk using the logical format."
"What is the purpose of the physical format of the 1581 disk?","The physical format of the 1581 disk is designed to allow more data to be stored on the disk, by using a double sided disk with 10 x 512 byte sectors per track, which is different from the logical format presented to the host computer."
"How does the 1581 handle commands from the host computer?","All commands sent from the host computer are parsed through the DOS (except the BURST commands) and refer to the logical format, allowing the 1581 to automatically translate the commands to the physical format."
"What is the block size used by the 1581 for DOS operations?","The 1581 uses a block size of 256 bytes for all DOS operations, which is the size of the sectors on the logical disk format."
"How many tracks are on a single side of the 1581 disk?","A single side of the 1581 disk has 80 tracks, which are divided into 10 x 512 byte sectors per track in the physical format."
"What is the purpose of the HEADER command in the 1581?","The HEADER command is used to create the physical disk format on the 1581, which is different from the logical format presented to the host computer."
"How does the 1581 present its disk format to the host computer?","The 1581 presents its disk format to the host computer as a single sided disk with 80 tracks, and 40 x 256 byte sectors per track, which is the logical format."
"What is the relationship between the logical and physical formats of the 1581 disk?","The logical format of the 1581 disk is a simplified view of the physical format, which is used by the host computer to interact with the disk, while the physical format is the actual format used to store data on the disk."
