1581 disk with basic 7,0: COPY

  The COPY command allows you to make a spare copy of any program
or file on a diskette. However, on a single derive like the 1581,
the  copy  must  be on the same diskette,  which means it must be
given a different name from the file copied.  The source file and
other files on the diskette are not changed. Files must be closed
before they can be copied or concatenated.

FORMAT FOR THE COPY COMMAND:

  COPY [Ddrive#,]"old file name" TO [Ddrive#,]"new file name"
       [,Udevice#]

where both drive#s would be 0 if included.
