question,answer
"What is the primary function of the DOS in the 1581 system?","The DOS keeps track of file management details, monitors free space, and keeps track of file names in the directory."
"What is the role of the Controller in the 1581 system?","The Controller deals with the physical world of the disk, reading and writing individual sectors."
"How do the DOS and Controller communicate with each other?","The DOS and Controller communicate through a 'mailbox' known as the Job Queue."
"What is the purpose of the Job Queue?","The Job Queue is used by the DOS to request operations from the Controller, and for the Controller to return status bytes to the DOS."
"How often does the Controller poll the Job Queue?","The Controller polls the Job Queue every 10 milliseconds."
"What is the purpose of the JSTROBE_CONTROLLER routine?","JSTROBE_CONTROLLER is a vectored routine that allows the DOS to bypass the Job Queue and directly execute a Controller command."
"What are the two types of parameters that can be passed to the Controller?","The two types of parameters are logical and physical parameters."
"How are logical parameters translated into physical parameters?","Logical parameters are translated into physical parameters by the TRANSTS routine."
"What is the purpose of the HDRS and HDRS2 mailboxes?","HDRS and HDRS2 are used to store logical and physical track and sector information for each job in the Job Queue."
"What is the purpose of the SIDS mailbox?","SIDS is used to store the physical side information for each job in the Job Queue."
"What is the purpose of the CACHE and CACHEOFF mailboxes?","CACHE and CACHEOFF are used to store pointers to the track cache buffer."
"What is the purpose of the BUFFCACHE?","BUFFCACHE is a 20-page buffer used to cache tracks from the disk."
"How many Job Queue locations are there?","There are 9 Job Queue locations, numbered 0-8."
"What is the purpose of the buffers associated with each Job Queue location?","The buffers are used to store data passed to/from the Controller during job execution."
"How are the buffers organized?","Each buffer is 256 bytes in size, and is located at a specific address starting at $0300."
"What is the purpose of the Controller Job Codes?","Controller Job Codes are used to request specific operations from the Controller, such as reading or writing a sector."
"How are the Controller Job Codes used?","The Controller Job Codes are placed in the Job Queue, and the Controller executes the requested operation and returns a status byte."
"What is the purpose of Table 1?","Table 1 lists the available Controller Job Codes that can be put into the Job Queue."
"What is the purpose of Table 2?","Table 2 lists the return codes that are returned by the Controller once a job has been executed."
"How does the DOS use the Controller?","The DOS writes parameters and a Controller Job Code into the Job Queue, and then waits for the job to be completed."
"What is the purpose of polling the Job Queue?","Polling the Job Queue allows the DOS to wait for a job to be completed and retrieve the return code."
"How is the return code retrieved from the Job Queue?","The return code is retrieved by polling the Job Queue location where the Controller Job Code was placed."
"What happens when a job is completed?","When a job is completed, the Controller sets bit 7 of the Job Queue location to 0."
"How does the DOS know when a job is completed?","The DOS knows when a job is completed by polling the Job Queue location and checking for bit 7 to be reset to 0."
"What is the purpose of the Vectored Jump Table?","The Vectored Jump Table is used to bypass the Job Queue and directly execute a Controller command."
"How is the Vectored Jump Table used?","The Vectored Jump Table is used by the DOS to directly execute a Controller command by calling the JSTROBE_CONTROLLER routine."
"What is the purpose of the TRANSTS routine?","The TRANSTS routine is used to translate logical parameters into physical parameters."
"How are logical parameters translated into physical parameters?","Logical parameters are translated into physical parameters by the TRANSTS routine, which writes the translated parameters to HDRS2 and SIDS."
"What is the purpose of the HDRS mailbox?","HDRS is used to store logical track and sector information for each job in the Job Queue."
