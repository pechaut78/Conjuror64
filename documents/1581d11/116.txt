      $90     Writes  the  job  queue's  buffer data to a
                      particular  logical track,  sector.  If the
                      same  track  is already in the track cache,
                      then  this  involves  only transferring the
                      job  queue  buffer  data to the track cache
                      buffer.  If  a different track's data is in
                      the  disk  (only  if  it was modified), the
                      desired  track  read  into  the track cache
                      buffer,  and finally the job queue buffer's
                      data transferred to the track cache.
