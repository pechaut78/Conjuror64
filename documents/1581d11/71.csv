question,answer
"what is the characteristic of each relative record","each relative record has a fixed length, including all special characters"
"what are the two popular ways to organize individual fields of information","one is free-format, with individual fields varying in length from record to record, and each field separated from the next by a carriage return character, and the other approach is to use fixed-length fields"
"what happens if fixed length fields are not all separated by carriage returns","you will either need to be sure a carriage return is included within each 88-character portion of the record, or you will have to use the GET# command to read the record, at a significant cost in speed"
"why is it recommended to build a copy of the current record in memory before writing it to disk","because each relative record is most easily written by a single PRINT# statement"
"how can a record be collected into a single string variable","with the help of BASIC's many string-handling functions"
"what is an example of organizing a 4-line mail label","it consists of 4 fields named 'NAME', 'STREET', 'CITY & STATE', and 'ZIP CODE', and has a total record size of 87 characters"
"what are the two ways to organize the 4-line mail label","with fixed length fields, and with variable length fields"
"what is the total length of the record with fixed length fields","87 characters"
"what is the potential length of the record with variable length fields","99 characters"
"what is the edited length of the record with variable length fields","87 characters"
"what is the advantage of using variable length records","you can take advantage of the variability of actual address lengths"
"what happens if the total length of all fields exceeds the space available","a program that uses variable record lengths must calculate the total length of each record as it is entered, to be sure the total of all fields doesn't exceed the space available"
"what is the disadvantage of using variable length records","they lose one character per field for carriage returns"
"what is the benefit of using variable length records","they can take advantage of the difference between maximum field length and average field length"
"how can you ensure that the total length of all fields doesn't exceed the space available","by calculating the total length of each record as it is entered"
"what is the purpose of the GET# command","to read the record, but at a significant cost in speed"
"what is the recommended approach to writing a relative record","to build a copy of the current record in memory before writing it to disk"
"what is the advantage of using fixed length fields","the field lengths add up to exactly the record length"
"what is the disadvantage of using fixed length fields","they do not take advantage of the variability of actual address lengths"
"what is the purpose of the PRINT# statement","to write the record to disk"
"what is the role of BASIC's string-handling functions","to help collect the record into a single string variable"
