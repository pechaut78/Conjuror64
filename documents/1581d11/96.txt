1581 disk:  AUTO BOOT LOADER

  During some operations  (power-up reset,  burst INQUIRE,  burst
QUERY,  an  initialize command)  the 1581 will automatically look
for  a  file or the disk named  'COPYRIGHT CBM 86'  that is a USR
type-file.  The format of the file is the same  as that described
previously for the utility loader.  If it is present, the file is
automatically loaded and executed.

  The  automatic  loading  of this file can be disabled by either
renaming it, setting the appropriate flag in the RAM sectors (see
Appendix C),  or  by  setting  a  flag variable in RAM to disable
further autoboots (see JDEJAVU jump table vector in Chapter 10).

  At  the  end of the autobooted program it should return control
to the 1581 via the JCBMBOOTRTN jump table vector.
