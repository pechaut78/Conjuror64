1581 disk with basic 7,0:  OPENING A FILE

  One  of  the most powerful tools in Commodore BASIC is the OPEN
statement.  With it, you may send data almost anywhere, much like
a telephone switchboard.  As you might expect, a command that can
do  this  much  is  fairly  complex.  You  have already used OPEN
statements regularly in some of your diskette commands.
  Before you study the format of the OPEN statement, let's review
some of the possible devices in a Commodore computer system.

Device#:  Name:   Used for:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
0     Keyboard    Receiving input from the computer operator
1     DATASSETTE  Sending and receiving information from cassette
2     RS232       Sending and receiving information from a modem
3     Screen      Sending output to a video display
4,5   Printer     Sending output to a hard copy printer
8-11  Disk Drive  Sending and receiving information from diskette
-----------------------------------------------------------------

  Because of the flexibility of the OPEN statement it is possible
for  a  single  program  statement  to  contact  any one of these
devices,  or  even  others,  depending  on  the value of a single
character in the command. If the character is kept in a variable,
the  device can even change each time that part of the program is
used,  sending  data alternately and with equal ease to diskette,
cassette, printer and screen.


|   In  the  last  chapter  you  learned  how to check for disk |
| errors  after  disk  commands  in  a  program.  It is equally |
| important  to check for disk errors after using file-handling |
| statements.  Failure  to  detect  a  disk  error before using |
| another file-handling statement could cause loss of data, and |
| failure of the BASIC program.                                 |
|   The  easiest  way  to check the disk is to follow all file- |
| handling statements with a GOSUB statement  to an error check |
| subroutine.                                                   |
|                                                               |
| EXAMPLE:                                                      |
