1581 disk with basic 7,0: in depth scratch:

  SCRATCH  is  a powerful command and should be used with caution
to be sure you delete only the files you really want erased. When
using  it  with  a  pattern,  we  suggest  you first use the same
pattern in a  DIRECTORY  command,  to be sure exactly which files
will  be  deleted.  That  way you'll have no unpleasant surprises
when you use the same pattern in the SCRATCH command.
  If you accidentally SCRATCH a file you shouldn't have, there is
still  a  chance of saving it by using the "UNSCRATCH" program on
your Test/Demo diskette.
