"what is the purpose of the COPY command on a C64?","The COPY command allows you to make a spare copy of any program or file on a diskette, creating a duplicate of the original file with a different name on the same diskette, without altering the source file or other files on the diskette."
"what is the syntax of the COPY command?","The syntax of the COPY command is COPY [Ddrive#,]\"old file name\" TO [Ddrive#,]\"new file name\" [,Udevice#], where both drive#s would be 0 if included, specifying the source and destination files and devices."
"what is the restriction on copying files on a single drive like the 1581?","On a single drive like the 1581, the copy must be on the same diskette, which means it must be given a different name from the file copied, as the source file and other files on the diskette are not changed."
"what is the requirement for files before they can be copied?","Files must be closed before they can be copied or concatenated, ensuring that the file is not in use and can be safely duplicated."
"what happens to the source file and other files on the diskette during the copy process?","The source file and other files on the diskette are not changed during the copy process, ensuring that the original files remain intact and unchanged."
"can you copy a file to a different diskette?","No, the COPY command only allows copying files on the same diskette, as it is designed to create a spare copy of a file on the same diskette, not to transfer files between diskettes."
"what is the purpose of specifying the drive number in the COPY command?","Specifying the drive number in the COPY command is optional, but it allows you to specify the drive containing the source file and the destination file, which is necessary if you have multiple drives connected to your C64."
"what is the purpose of the Udevice# parameter in the COPY command?","The Udevice# parameter in the COPY command specifies the device number of the disk drive, which is optional but necessary if you have multiple disk drives connected to your C64."
"can you concatenate files using the COPY command?","Yes, the COPY command can be used to concatenate files, which means to combine the contents of two or more files into a single file, by specifying the files to be concatenated in the COPY command."
"what happens if you try to copy an open file?","If you try to copy an open file, the COPY command will not work, as files must be closed before they can be copied or concatenated, to ensure that the file is not in use and can be safely duplicated."
