"what is the purpose of opening two channels when working with direct access data on a C64?","When working with direct access data, two channels need to be open to the disk: the command channel, which is used throughout the book, and another for data. The command channel is opened with the usual OPEN 15,8,15 or equivalent, while a direct access data channel is opened much like other files, except that the hash sign (#), optionally followed by a memory buffer number, is used as a file name."
"what is the format for direct access file open statements on a C64?","The format for direct access file open statements is OPEN file#,device#,channel#,"#buffer#", where file# is the file number, device# is the disk's device number (normally 8), channel# is the channel number (a number between 2 and 14 not used by other files open at the same time), and buffer# (if present) is a number specifying the memory buffer within the 1581 to use for this file's data."
"how do you specify which disk buffer to use when opening a direct access file on a C64?","To specify which disk buffer to use, you can include the buffer number in the OPEN statement, for example: OPEN 4,8,4,\"#2\". If you don't specify which buffer to use (e.g. OPEN 5,8,5,\"#\"), the 1581 selects one."
"what is the range of channel numbers that can be used for direct access files on a C64?","The range of channel numbers that can be used for direct access files is between 2 and 14, as long as the channel number is not used by other files open at the same time."
"what is the purpose of the hash sign (#) in a direct access file open statement on a C64?","The hash sign (#) is used as a file name in a direct access file open statement, and can be optionally followed by a memory buffer number."
"what is the default behavior if you don't specify a buffer number when opening a direct access file on a C64?","If you don't specify a buffer number when opening a direct access file (e.g. OPEN 5,8,5,\"#\"), the 1581 selects one."
"what is the device number used for the disk in a direct access file open statement on a C64?","The device number used for the disk in a direct access file open statement is normally 8."
"can you use any channel number for direct access files on a C64?","No, you cannot use any channel number for direct access files. The channel number must be a number between 2 and 14, and it cannot be used by other files open at the same time."
"what is the purpose of the buffer number in a direct access file open statement on a C64?","The buffer number in a direct access file open statement specifies the memory buffer within the 1581 to use for this file's data."
"how do you open a direct access data channel on a C64?","A direct access data channel is opened much like other files, except that the hash sign (#), optionally followed by a memory buffer number, is used as a file name. The format for direct access file open statements is OPEN file#,device#,channel#,\"#buffer#\"."
