"what is the purpose of the VERIFY command in Commodore 64","The VERIFY command makes a byte-by-byte comparison of the program currently in memory against a program on diskette, including the BASIC line links, which may be different for different types of memory configurations."
"What happens when a program saved to disk on a C64 is reloaded into a C128 and then verified","The program wouldn't verify properly because the line links point to different memory locations, resulting in a "VERIFY ERROR" even if both copies are correct."
"What is the consequence of a single difference between the disk copy and the memory copy of a program when using the VERIFY command","A "VERIFY ERROR" will be displayed, indicating a problem, even if neither copy is bad, but they were supposed to be identical."
"How does the VERIFY command handle differences in memory configurations","The command takes into account the BASIC line links, which may be different for different types of memory configurations, ensuring a thorough comparison of the program in memory and on disk."
"What is the significance of the BASIC line links in the VERIFY command","The BASIC line links are included in the comparison, which may be different for different types of memory configurations, ensuring that the verification process is accurate and reliable."
"What is the outcome when the VERIFY command detects a difference between the disk and memory copies of a program","A "VERIFY ERROR" is displayed, indicating that there is a problem, even if neither copy is bad, but they were supposed to be identical."
"How does the VERIFY command determine if a program is identical on disk and in memory","The command performs a byte-by-byte comparison of the program in memory against the program on diskette, ensuring that every aspect of the program is identical."
"What is the purpose of including the BASIC line links in the VERIFY command","Including the BASIC line links ensures that the verification process takes into account the specific memory configuration of the system, resulting in a more accurate comparison."
"What happens when the VERIFY command finds no differences between the disk and memory copies of a program","The command will not display an error message, indicating that the program in memory and on disk are identical."
"In what scenario would the VERIFY command display a "VERIFY ERROR" message","The command would display a "VERIFY ERROR" message if the disk copy of the program differs at all from the copy in memory, even if neither copy is bad, but they were supposed to be identical."
