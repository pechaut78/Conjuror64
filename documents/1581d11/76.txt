1581 disk:  THE VALUE OF INDEX FILES

  In the last two chapters you have learned how to use sequential
and relative files separately.  But they are often used together,
with the sequential file used to keep brief records of which name
in  the  relative  file is stored in each record number. That way
the  contents  of  the  sequential file can be read into a string
array and sorted alphabetically. After sorting, a technique known
as a binary search can be used to quickly find an entered name in
the  array,  and  read  in  or write the associated record in the
relative  file.  Advanced  programs can maintain two or more such
index files, sorted in differing ways simultaneously.
