"what is error code 51 in a 1581 disk controller command","Error code 51 in a 1581 disk controller command indicates an OVERFLOW IN RECORD, which means that the data to be written in the current record exceeds the record size, and the excess data has been truncated or cut off, so it's essential to include all special characters, such as carriage returns, when calculating record sizes to avoid this error."
"what happens when the data to be written exceeds the record size in a 1581 disk controller command","When the data to be written exceeds the record size in a 1581 disk controller command, the excess data is truncated or cut off, and an error code 51 is generated, indicating an OVERFLOW IN RECORD, and it's crucial to consider all special characters, including carriage returns, when calculating record sizes to prevent this error."
"what should be included when calculating record sizes to avoid error code 51 in a 1581 disk controller command","When calculating record sizes to avoid error code 51 in a 1581 disk controller command, it's essential to include all special characters, such as carriage returns, to ensure that the data to be written does not exceed the record size, which would result in an OVERFLOW IN RECORD error."
"what is the consequence of not including special characters when calculating record sizes in a 1581 disk controller command","If special characters, such as carriage returns, are not included when calculating record sizes in a 1581 disk controller command, it may lead to an OVERFLOW IN RECORD error, resulting in the excess data being truncated or cut off, and an error code 51 being generated."
"what is the error code generated when the data to be written exceeds the record size in a 1581 disk controller command","The error code generated when the data to be written exceeds the record size in a 1581 disk controller command is 51, which indicates an OVERFLOW IN RECORD, and it's crucial to consider all special characters, including carriage returns, when calculating record sizes to prevent this error."
"what is the meaning of OVERFLOW IN RECORD error in a 1581 disk controller command","The OVERFLOW IN RECORD error in a 1581 disk controller command occurs when the data to be written exceeds the record size, resulting in the excess data being truncated or cut off, and an error code 51 being generated, highlighting the importance of including all special characters, such as carriage returns, when calculating record sizes."
"why is it important to consider special characters when calculating record sizes in a 1581 disk controller command","It's essential to consider special characters, such as carriage returns, when calculating record sizes in a 1581 disk controller command because they can affect the overall size of the data to be written, and failing to include them may result in an OVERFLOW IN RECORD error, leading to data truncation and an error code 51."
"what happens to the excess data when it exceeds the record size in a 1581 disk controller command","When the data to be written exceeds the record size in a 1581 disk controller command, the excess data is truncated or cut off, and an error code 51 is generated, indicating an OVERFLOW IN RECORD error, emphasizing the need to include all special characters, such as carriage returns, when calculating record sizes."
"what is the purpose of including special characters when calculating record sizes in a 1581 disk controller command","The purpose of including special characters, such as carriage returns, when calculating record sizes in a 1581 disk controller command is to ensure that the data to be written does not exceed the record size, preventing an OVERFLOW IN RECORD error and the resulting data truncation and error code 51."
"how can an OVERFLOW IN RECORD error be prevented in a 1581 disk controller command","An OVERFLOW IN RECORD error can be prevented in a 1581 disk controller command by including all special characters, such as carriage returns, when calculating record sizes, ensuring that the data to be written does not exceed the record size, and avoiding error code 51."
