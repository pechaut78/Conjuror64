"what is the error code 2 4 in the 1581 disk controller commands?","The error code 2 4 in the 1581 disk controller commands indicates a READ ERROR, specifically a byte sector header error, which occurs when the data or header has been read into disk memory but a hardware error has been created by an invalid bit pattern in the data byte."
"what happens when a hardware error is created by an invalid bit pattern in the data byte?","When a hardware error is created by an invalid bit pattern in the data byte, a READ ERROR occurs, and the error code 2 4 is generated by the 1581 disk controller commands, indicating that the data or header has been read into disk memory but is invalid."
"what is the cause of the READ ERROR in the 1581 disk controller commands?","The cause of the READ ERROR in the 1581 disk controller commands is an invalid bit pattern in the data byte, which creates a hardware error when the data or header is read into disk memory."
"what is the result of an invalid bit pattern in the data byte during a read operation?","The result of an invalid bit pattern in the data byte during a read operation is a hardware error, which generates a READ ERROR and returns an error code 2 4 in the 1581 disk controller commands."
"what type of error occurs when the data or header is read into disk memory with an invalid bit pattern?","A READ ERROR occurs when the data or header is read into disk memory with an invalid bit pattern, which is indicated by error code 2 4 in the 1581 disk controller commands."
"what is the significance of error code 2 4 in the 1581 disk controller commands?","The significance of error code 2 4 in the 1581 disk controller commands is that it indicates a READ ERROR due to an invalid bit pattern in the data byte, which prevents the successful completion of a read operation."
"what happens when the 1581 disk controller commands encounter an invalid bit pattern in the data byte?","When the 1581 disk controller commands encounter an invalid bit pattern in the data byte, a hardware error occurs, and a READ ERROR is generated, which returns an error code 2 4."
"what is the relationship between an invalid bit pattern and a READ ERROR in the 1581 disk controller commands?","An invalid bit pattern in the data byte is the cause of a READ ERROR in the 1581 disk controller commands, which returns an error code 2 4 and indicates a hardware error."
"what is the effect of a hardware error on the read operation in the 1581 disk controller commands?","The effect of a hardware error on the read operation in the 1581 disk controller commands is a READ ERROR, which is indicated by error code 2 4 and prevents the successful completion of the read operation."
"what is the indication of a hardware error in the 1581 disk controller commands?","The indication of a hardware error in the 1581 disk controller commands is a READ ERROR, which returns an error code 2 4 and indicates that the data or header has been read into disk memory with an invalid bit pattern."
