1581 disk:  SAVE WITH REPLACE

  If a file already exists, it can't be saved again with the same
name  because  the  disk  drive only allows one copy of any given
file name per diskette. It is possible to get around this problem
using the  RENAME and  SCRATCH commands described later. However,
if  all  you  wish to do is replace a program or data file with a
revised  version,  another  command  is more convenient. Known as
SAVE-WITH-REPLACE, or @SAVE.  This option tells the disk drive to
replace any file it finds in the diskette directory with the same
name, substituting the new file for the old version.

FORMAT FOR SAVE WITH REPLACE:

  SAVE "@drive#:file name",device#

where all the parameters are as usual except for adding a leading
"at" sign (@). The "drive#:" is required here.

EXAMPLE:

  SAVE"@0:REVISED PROGRAM",8

  The  actual  procedure   is  that  the  new  version  is  saved
completely, then the old version is erased. Because it works this
way,  there  is  little  danger  a  disaster such as losing power
midway  through  the  process  would destroy both the old and new
copies  of the file.  Nothing happens to the old copy until after
the new copy is saved properly.
