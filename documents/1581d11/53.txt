1581 disk with basic 7,0: READING FILE DATA: USING INPUT#

  Once  information has been written properly to a diskette file,
it  may  be read back into the computer with an INPUT# statement.
Just  as  the  PRINT# statement is much like the PRINT statement,
INPUT#  is  nearly  identical to  INPUT,  except that the list of
items  following  the  command  word comes from a particular file
instead of the keyboard.  Both statements are subject to the same
limitations-halting  input after a comma or colon,  not accepting
data  items  too  large  to  fit in BASIC's input buffer, and not
accepting non-numeric data into a numeric variable.
