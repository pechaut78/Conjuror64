JIDLE              $FF00   Main  idle  loop.  When  a  Controller
                           command is completed  the IDLE routine
                           is executed. It first checks to see if
                           there are any more jobs pending in the
                           Job Queue. If so, it executes them. If
                           not,  it sits in the idle loop waiting
                           for  something  to  happen,   such  as
                           another  job being put into the queue,
                           ATN  line going low,  disk inserted or

                           ATN  line going low,  Fast Serial Byte
                           is   shifted   in,   timer  time  out,
