"what are direct access commands used for in complex commercial programs","Direct access commands are used in complex commercial programs to provide almost complete flexibility in data-handling, allowing programmers to read and write information entirely under their direction, but imposing tremendous responsibilities on the programmer to properly organize data without help from the disk drive itself."
"what is a common use of direct access commands in utility programs","A common use of direct access commands in utility programs is to view and alter parts of the diskette that are not normally seen directly, such as changing the name of a diskette without erasing all of its programs, locking a program so it can't be erased, or hiding information in unexpected locations."
"what is the benefit of using direct access commands in programming","The benefit of using direct access commands in programming is that they provide almost complete flexibility in data-handling, allowing programmers to have complete control over reading and writing information on the diskette."
"what is the drawback of using direct access commands in programming","The drawback of using direct access commands in programming is that they impose tremendous responsibilities on the programmer to properly organize data without help from the disk drive itself, making them typically only used in complex commercial programs."
"what type of programs typically use direct access commands","Complex commercial programs and utility programs typically use direct access commands, as they require a high level of flexibility and control over data-handling."
"what is an example of using direct access commands to alter a diskette","An example of using direct access commands to alter a diskette is to change the name of a diskette without erasing all of its programs, allowing the programmer to modify the diskette's metadata without affecting its contents."
"what is the role of the programmer when using direct access commands","The role of the programmer when using direct access commands is to take complete responsibility for organizing data on the diskette, as the disk drive itself does not provide any assistance in this regard."
"what is the advantage of using direct access commands in utility programs","The advantage of using direct access commands in utility programs is that they allow the programmer to access and modify parts of the diskette that are not normally accessible, providing a high level of flexibility and control."
"what is an example of using direct access commands to secure a program","An example of using direct access commands to secure a program is to lock a program so it can't be erased, providing an additional layer of protection against accidental or malicious deletion."
"what is the key characteristic of direct access commands","The key characteristic of direct access commands is that they specify individual sectors on the diskette, allowing the programmer to read and write information entirely under their direction."
