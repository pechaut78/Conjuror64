"how does the computer store numeric variables in memory","Inside the computer, the space occupied by a numeric variable depends only on its type. Simple numeric variables use seven bytes (character locations) of memory. Real array variables use five bytes per array element, and integer array elements use two bytes each."
"what happens when a numeric variable is written to a file","When a numeric variable or any type is written to a file, the space it occupies depends entirely on its length, not its type. This is because numeric data is written to a file in the form of a string, as if the STR$() function had been performed on it."
"what is the format of numeric data written to a file","The first character will be a blank space if the number is positive, and a minus sign (-) if the number is negative. Then comes the number, digit-by-digit. The last character is a cursor right character."
"why is the default method of writing numeric data to a file inefficient","This format allows the disk data to be read back into a string or numeric variable later. It is, however, wasteful of disk space, and it can be difficult to anticipate the space required by numbers of unknown length."
"how can you optimize writing numeric data to a file","Some programs convert all numeric variables into strings before writing them to diskette, and use string functions to remove any unneeded characters in advance. Doing so still allows those data elements to be read back into a numeric variable by INPUT# later, although file data errors may be avoided by reading all data in as strings, and converting to numbers using the VAL() function after the information is inside the computer."
"what is an example of converting a numeric variable to a string without the leading space for its numeric sign","N$=RIGHT$(STR$(N),LEN(STR$(N))-1) will convert a positive number N into a string N$ without the usual leading space for its numeric sign. Then instead of writing PRINT#5,N, you would use PRINT#5,N$."
"what is the purpose of using the VAL() function when reading data from a file","File data errors may be avoided by reading all data in as strings, and converting to numbers using the VAL() function after the information is inside the computer."
"how does the STR$() function affect numeric data when written to a file","The STR$() function is performed on the numeric data when written to a file, which allows the disk data to be read back into a string or numeric variable later."
"what is the advantage of reading all data from a file as strings","File data errors may be avoided by reading all data in as strings, and converting to numbers using the VAL() function after the information is inside the computer."
"why is it difficult to anticipate the space required by numbers of unknown length when writing to a file","The space occupied by a numeric variable when written to a file depends entirely on its length, not its type, which can make it difficult to anticipate the space required by numbers of unknown length."
