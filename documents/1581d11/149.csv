"Where are the switches located that enable changing the device number of the 1581 disk drive?","The switches are located on the back of the 1581 disk drive and can be set using a screwdriver, pen, or any other small tool."
"How do you temporarily change the device number of a disk drive via a program?","When power is first turned on, the drive reads an I/O location whose value is controlled by the two switches on its circuit board, and writes the device number it reads there into memory locations 119 and 120. Any time thereafter, you may write over that device number with a new one, which will be effective until it is changed again, or the 1581 is reset."
"What is the purpose of the two switches on the back of the 1581 disk drive?","The two switches on the back of the 1581 enable you to change the device number of the drive."
"What are the possible device numbers that can be set using the switches on the back of the 1581 disk drive?","The possible device numbers that can be set using the switches on the back of the 1581 disk drive are 8, 9, 10, and 11, depending on the switch settings."
"What is the relationship between the switch settings and the device number on the 1581 disk drive?","The switch settings on the back of the 1581 disk drive determine the device number, with specific switch settings corresponding to specific device numbers, as shown in the table: Left switch UP and Right switch UP corresponds to device number 8, Left switch DOWN and Right switch UP corresponds to device number 9, Left switch UP and Right switch DOWN corresponds to device number 10, and Left switch DOWN and Right switch DOWN corresponds to device number 11."
"How does the 1581 disk drive determine its device number when power is first turned on?","When power is first turned on, the drive reads an I/O location whose value is controlled by the two switches on its circuit board, and writes the device number it reads there into memory locations 119 and 120."
"What happens to the device number when the 1581 disk drive is reset?","When the 1581 disk drive is reset, the device number is reset to its default value, which is determined by the switch settings on the back of the drive."
"Can the device number of the 1581 disk drive be changed dynamically while the drive is in use?","Yes, the device number of the 1581 disk drive can be changed dynamically while the drive is in use by writing a new device number to memory locations 119 and 120."
"What are memory locations 119 and 120 used for on the 1581 disk drive?","Memory locations 119 and 120 are used to store the device number of the 1581 disk drive, which can be written to and changed dynamically."
"Is it possible to change the device number of the 1581 disk drive without using the switches on the back of the drive?","Yes, it is possible to change the device number of the 1581 disk drive without using the switches on the back of the drive by writing a new device number to memory locations 119 and 120 via a program."
