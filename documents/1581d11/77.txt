1581 disk:  DIRECT ACCESS COMMANDS


  Direct  access  commands  specify  individual  sectors  on  the
diskette,  reading  and  writing  information entirely under your
direction.  This  gives them almost complete flexibility in data-
handling programs, but imposes tremendous responsibilities on the
programmer.  As a result,  they are normally used only in complex
commercial  programs  able to properly organize data without help
from the disk drive itself.
  A far more common use of direct access commands is  in  utility
programs  used  to  view and alter parts of the diskette that are
not normally seen directly.  For  instance,  such commands can be
used to change the name of a diskette  without erasing all of its
programs,  to lock a program so it can't be erased,  or hide your
name in a location where it won't be expected.
