"what is error code 26 in a 1581 disk controller?","Error code 26 in a 1581 disk controller indicates that the controller has been requested to write a data block while the write-protect sensor is uncovered, typically caused by writing to a diskette whose write protect notch is pushed back to expose the hole, preventing changes to the diskette's contents."
"what happens when the write-protect sensor is uncovered in a 1581 disk controller?","When the write-protect sensor is uncovered in a 1581 disk controller, it prevents writing to the diskette, and error code 26 is generated, indicating that the controller has been requested to write a data block while the write-protect sensor is uncovered."
"what is the purpose of the write-protect notch on a diskette?","The write-protect notch on a diskette is used to prevent changes to the diskette's contents by covering the notch, and when pushed back, it exposes the hole, allowing writing to the diskette, but if it's not pushed back, it prevents writing, and error code 26 is generated."
"what causes error code 26 in a 1581 disk controller?","Error code 26 in a 1581 disk controller is usually caused by writing to a diskette whose write protect notch is pushed back to expose the hole, preventing changes to the diskette's contents."
"how does the write-protect sensor work in a 1581 disk controller?","The write-protect sensor in a 1581 disk controller is triggered when the write-protect notch on the diskette is pushed back, exposing the hole, and preventing writing to the diskette, generating error code 26."
"what is the result of pushing back the write-protect notch on a diskette?","Pushing back the write-protect notch on a diskette exposes the hole, allowing writing to the diskette, but if the controller tries to write to the diskette, error code 26 is generated, indicating that the write-protect sensor is uncovered."
"what is the relationship between the write-protect notch and error code 26?","The write-protect notch is directly related to error code 26, as pushing back the notch exposes the hole, allowing writing to the diskette, but if the controller tries to write to the diskette, error code 26 is generated, indicating that the write-protect sensor is uncovered."
"how does the 1581 disk controller prevent changes to the diskette's contents?","The 1581 disk controller prevents changes to the diskette's contents by using a write-protect sensor that is triggered when the write-protect notch on the diskette is not pushed back, generating error code 26 if the controller tries to write to the diskette."
"what is the purpose of error code 26 in a 1581 disk controller?","The purpose of error code 26 in a 1581 disk controller is to indicate that the controller has been requested to write a data block while the write-protect sensor is uncovered, preventing changes to the diskette's contents."
"what happens when a diskette's write-protect notch is not pushed back?","When a diskette's write-protect notch is not pushed back, the write-protect sensor in the 1581 disk controller is triggered, preventing writing to the diskette, and generating error code 26 if the controller tries to write to the diskette."
