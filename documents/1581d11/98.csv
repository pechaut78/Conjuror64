"What is the purpose of the Burst Command Instruction Set (BCIS)?","The Burst Command Instruction Set (BCIS) is a series of powerful, versatile, and complex commands that enables the user to format, read, and write in numerous formats."
"How do burst commands interact with the kernal?","Burst commands are sent via kernal calls, but the handshaking of data is done by the user for maximum performance."
"What is the importance of exercising care when using the BCIS?","There is no parameter checking, so exercise care when using the BCIS, as incorrect commands can cause issues, such as a burst read with an illegal track address causing the drive to keep trying to find the invalid track."
"How does the 1581 handle reading and writing in other formats?","Reading and writing in other formats is automatic if the commands are given in proper sequence, following the handshake conventions exactly for maximum performance."
"What is the exception to the rule that burst commands do not translate from logical to physical track and sector?","With the exception of READ and WRITE, burst commands do not translate from logical to physical track and sector."
"How do burst sector READ and WRITE commands handle logical to physical translation?","Burst sector READ and WRITE commands provide a flag to enable logical to physical translation, and if the flag is set, the drive does the translation and the default logical number of bytes per sector (256) is transferred instead of the physical number of bytes per sector (512)."
"What is the importance of following the handshake conventions when using the BCIS?","It's important to follow the handshake conventions exactly for maximum performance."
"What is the default logical number of bytes per sector when using burst sector READ and WRITE commands?","The default logical number of bytes per sector is 256 when using burst sector READ and WRITE commands with the flag set."
"How does the 1581 handle track and sector parameters in burst commands?","All track and sector parameters refer to physical locations, as burst commands do not translate from logical to physical track and sector, except for READ and WRITE commands."
"What is the physical number of bytes per sector when using burst sector READ and WRITE commands?","The physical number of bytes per sector is 512 when using burst sector READ and WRITE commands."
