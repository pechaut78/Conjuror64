1581 disk with basic 7,0: DCLEAR

  One command that should not often be needed on the 1581, but is
still of occasional value is DCLEAR.  On the 1581, and nearly all
other Commodore drives, this function is performed automatically,
whenever a new diskette is inserted.
  The result of an DCLEAR,  whether forced by a command,  or done
automatically  by  the  disk,  is  a  re-reading  of  the current
diskette's BAM  into a disk buffer.  This information must always
be  correct  in  order  for the disk to store new files properly.
However,  since the chore is handled automatically, the only time
you'd  need  to  use the command is if something happened to make
the information in the drive buffers unreliable.
