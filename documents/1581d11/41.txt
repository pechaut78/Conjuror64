1581 disk with basic 7,0: RENAME

  The RENAME command allows you to alter the name of a program or
other file in the diskette directory. Since only the directory is
affected, RENAME works very quickly.  If you try to RENAME a file
by using a file name already in the directory,  the computer will
respond  with  a  "FILE EXISTS"  error.  A file  must be properly
closed before it can be renamed.

FORMAT FOR RENAME COMMAND:

  RENAME [Ddrive#,] "old name" TO [Ddrive#,] "new name"
         [,Udevice#]

where both drive#s, if included, would be 0.
