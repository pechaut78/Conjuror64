"What is the purpose of using the DIRECTORY command before using the SCRATCH command with a pattern?","To ensure that you delete only the files you intend to erase and avoid unpleasant surprises, by first verifying which files will be deleted using the DIRECTORY command with the same pattern."
"What should you do if you accidentally SCRATCH a file you shouldn't have?","You can try to save the file by using the 'UNSCRATCH' program on your Test/Demo diskette."
"What is a splat file and what does the asterisk symbol (*) indicate in a directory listing?","A splat file is a file that was never properly closed, indicated by an asterisk (*) before the file type in a directory listing, meaning there is no valid chain of sector links for the SCRATCH command to follow in erasing the file."
"Why should you never SCRATCH a splat file?","Because scratching a splat file can cause permanent damage to other programs or files by improperly freeing up sectors that are still needed, and can lead to corruption of files on the diskette."
"What should you do if you find a splat file or discover too late that you have scratched such a file?","Immediately validate the diskette using the VALIDATE command, and if you have added files to the diskette since scratching the splat file, copy the entire diskette onto another fresh diskette using a copy program, not a backup program."
"What is the purpose of comparing the number of blocks free in the new copy of the diskette to the original diskette?","To check if any damage has been done to the files on the diskette, and if the numbers match, no damage has been done, but if not, at least one file on the diskette has been corrupted and all should be checked immediately."
"What is the consequence of scratching a splat file?","It can cause permanent damage to other programs or files by improperly freeing up sectors that are still needed, leading to corruption of files on the diskette."
"How can you recover a scratched file?","By using the 'UNSCRATCH' program on your Test/Demo diskette."
"Why is it important to use the SCRATCH command with caution?","Because it is a powerful command that can permanently delete files, and using it with a pattern can lead to unintended consequences if not used carefully."
"What should you do if you have added files to the diskette since scratching a splat file?","Immediately copy the entire diskette onto another fresh diskette using a copy program, not a backup program, to prevent recreating the same problem on the new diskette."
