"what is error code 27 in a 1581 disk controller?","Error code 27 in a 1581 disk controller indicates a READ ERROR, specifically a CRC error in the header bytes of the requested data block, which prevents the block from being read into disk memory."
"what happens when a 1581 disk controller detects an error in the header bytes of a data block?","When a 1581 disk controller detects an error in the header bytes of a data block, it returns an error code 27, indicating a READ ERROR, and the block is not read into disk memory."
"what is the consequence of a CRC error in the header bytes of a data block on a 1581 disk?","A CRC error in the header bytes of a data block on a 1581 disk prevents the block from being read into disk memory, resulting in a READ ERROR and an error code 27 being returned by the controller."
"what type of error is indicated by error code 27 on a 1581 disk controller?","Error code 27 on a 1581 disk controller indicates a READ ERROR, specifically a CRC error in the header bytes of the requested data block."
"what is the source of the error code 27 on a 1581 disk controller?","The source of the error code 27 on a 1581 disk controller is a CRC error in the header bytes of the requested data block, which prevents the block from being read into disk memory."
"what happens to the data block when a 1581 disk controller detects a CRC error in the header bytes?","When a 1581 disk controller detects a CRC error in the header bytes, the data block is not read into disk memory, and an error code 27 is returned, indicating a READ ERROR."
"what is the result of a CRC error in the header bytes of a data block on a 1581 disk?","The result of a CRC error in the header bytes of a data block on a 1581 disk is a READ ERROR, indicated by error code 27, and the block is not read into disk memory."
