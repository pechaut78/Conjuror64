question,answer
"What determines the speed of a peripheral device?","The Fast Serial (byte mode) protocol makes that determination internally when you include a query routine (send-cmd-string)."
"What is the purpose of the send-cmd-string routine?","To determine the speed of the peripheral device."
"What happens if the device is fast?","The serial-in routine is executed to read data from the peripheral device."
"What is the repeat loop for in the BURST READ protocol?","To repeat the read process for all sectors."
"What is the purpose of the toggle-clock routine?","To wait for status and then start the double buffer."
"What is stored in the buffer during the BURST READ protocol?","Data from the peripheral device."
"What marks the end of the BURST READ protocol?","The last byte of the last sector."
"What is the alternative to the BURST READ protocol if the device is not fast?","The read-1581 routine."
"What is the purpose of the send-cmd-string routine in the BURST WRITE protocol?","To determine the speed of the peripheral device."
"What happens if the device is fast in the BURST WRITE protocol?","The serial-out routine is executed to send data to the peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the repeat loop in the BURST WRITE protocol?","To repeat the write process for all sectors."
"What is the purpose of the serial-in routine in the BURST WRITE protocol?","To receive status from the peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the set-clock-low routine in the BURST WRITE protocol?","To ready the clock for status."
"What is the purpose of the read-err routine in the BURST WRITE protocol?","To check for controller errors."
"What marks the end of the BURST WRITE protocol?","The last sector."
"What is the alternative to the BURST WRITE protocol if the device is not fast?","The write-1581 routine."
"What is the purpose of the toggle-clock routine in the BURST READ protocol?","To wait for status and then start the double buffer."
"What is the purpose of the wait-byte routine in the BURST READ protocol?","To wait for the byte from the peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the store-byte routine in the BURST READ protocol?","To save the data from the peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the read-error routine in the BURST READ protocol?","To retrieve the error byte from the peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the set-clock-high routine in the BURST READ protocol?","To restore the clock."
"What is the purpose of the serial-in routine in the BURST READ protocol?","To receive data from the peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the repeat loop in the BURST READ protocol?","To repeat the read process for all sectors."
"What is the purpose of the until last-byte loop in the BURST READ protocol?","To repeat the process until the last byte is read."
"What is the purpose of the until last-sector loop in the BURST READ protocol?","To repeat the process until the last sector is read."
"What is the purpose of the send-cmd-string routine in the BURST READ protocol?","To determine the speed of the peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the if device-fast then statement in the BURST READ protocol?","To execute the BURST READ protocol if the device is fast."
"What is the purpose of the else statement in the BURST READ protocol?","To execute the read-1581 routine if the device is not fast."
