"what is the purpose of the UTILITY LOADER command on a C64?","The UTILITY LOADER command is used to load a user-type (USR) file into the drive RAM. This command is essential for transferring data from a file into the computer's memory, allowing the program to access and utilize the loaded data."
"what are the first two bytes of a file used for in the UTILITY LOADER command?","The first two bytes of a file in the UTILITY LOADER command contain the low and high addresses respectively, which specify the memory location where the file will be loaded."
"what is the purpose of the third byte in a file used with the UTILITY LOADER command?","The third byte in a file used with the UTILITY LOADER command specifies the amount of characters that follow, indicating the size of the data being loaded into the drive RAM."
"why is a trailing checksum byte required in a file used with the UTILITY LOADER command?","A trailing checksum byte is required in a file used with the UTILITY LOADER command to ensure data integrity and detect any errors that may have occurred during the loading process."
"what is the format for the UTILITY LOADER command?","The format for the UTILITY LOADER command is PRINT#15,\"&0:filename\", where filename is the name of the file to be loaded into the drive RAM."
"what is the purpose of the load address in the UTILITY LOADER command?","The load address in the UTILITY LOADER command specifies the starting address in memory where the file will be loaded, allowing the program to access and utilize the loaded data."
"how does a program return from the UTILITY LOADER routine?","A program returns from the UTILITY LOADER routine by ending with an RTS (ReTurn from Subroutine) instruction, which returns control to the calling program."
"what is the significance of the RTS instruction in the UTILITY LOADER routine?","The RTS instruction in the UTILITY LOADER routine is essential for returning control to the calling program, allowing the program to continue executing after the loading process is complete."
"what happens if a program does not end with an RTS instruction after using the UTILITY LOADER command?","If a program does not end with an RTS instruction after using the UTILITY LOADER command, the program will not return control to the calling program, resulting in unpredictable behavior or errors."
"what is the relationship between the load address and the starting address in the UTILITY LOADER command?","The load address in the UTILITY LOADER command is the same as the starting address, specifying the memory location where the file will be loaded, allowing the program to access and utilize the loaded data."
