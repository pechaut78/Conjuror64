  The  other  error  message   "FILE DATA ERROR"   is  caused  by
attempting  to  read  a  non-numeric  character  into  a  numeric
variable.  To a computer, a number is the characters 0 through 9,
the  "+"  and  "-"  signs,  the  decimal  point  (.),  the  SPACE
character, and the letter "E" used in scientific notation. If any
other character appears in an INPUT# to a numeric variable, "FILE
DATA ERROR"  will  be  displayed  and the program will halt.  The
usual  causes  of  this error are a mismatch between the order in
which variables are written to  and  read from a file,  a missing
carriage return within a  PRINT#  statement that writes more than
one data item,  or a data item  that includes either a comma or a
colon without a preceding quotation mark.  Once a file data error
has occurred, you should correct it by reading the data item into
a  string  variable,  and converting it back to a number with the
BASIC VAL() statement  after removing non-numeric characters with
the string functions described in your computer user's manual.
