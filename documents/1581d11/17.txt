1581 disk: Locked Files

  Occasionally,  a diskette will contain a locked file; one which
cannot  be  erased with the  SCRATCH  command.  Such files may be
recognized  by  the  "<"  character which immediately follows the
file type in their directory entry. If you wish to erase a locked
file, you will have to use a sector editor program to clear bit 6
of  the  file-type  byte  in the directory entry on the diskette.
Conversely, to lock a file, you would set bit 6 of the same byte.
