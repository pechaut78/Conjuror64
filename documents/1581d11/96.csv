"What is the name of the file that the 1581 disk automatically looks for during certain operations?","The file is named 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' and is a USR type-file with the same format as the utility loader."
"What triggers the automatic loading of the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file on the 1581 disk?","The automatic loading is triggered by operations such as power-up reset, burst INQUIRE, burst QUERY, or an initialize command."
"How can the automatic loading of the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file be disabled on the 1581 disk?","The automatic loading can be disabled by renaming the file, setting the appropriate flag in the RAM sectors (see Appendix C), or by setting a flag variable in RAM to disable further autoboots (see JDEJAVU jump table vector in Chapter 10)."
"What should the autobooted program do at the end of its execution on the 1581 disk?","The autobooted program should return control to the 1581 via the JCBMBOOTRTN jump table vector."
"What is the purpose of the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file on the 1581 disk?","The 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file is automatically loaded and executed by the 1581 disk during certain operations, and its purpose is to perform specific tasks or initialize the system."
"How does the 1581 disk locate the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file during automatic loading?","The 1581 disk searches for the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file by name, and if found, loads and executes it automatically."
"What happens if the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file is not present on the 1581 disk?","If the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file is not present, the 1581 disk will not automatically load and execute it, and the system will behave as if the file was not present."
"Can the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file be replaced with a custom file on the 1581 disk?","Yes, the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file can be replaced with a custom file, but it must have the same format and name to be recognized by the 1581 disk's autoboot mechanism."
"How does the 1581 disk determine the format of the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file?","The format of the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file is the same as that of the utility loader, which is a specific format recognized by the 1581 disk's autoboot mechanism."
"What is the significance of the JDEJAVU jump table vector in the context of the 1581 disk's autoboot mechanism?","The JDEJAVU jump table vector is used to disable further autoboots by setting a flag variable in RAM, which prevents the 1581 disk from automatically loading and executing the 'COPYRIGHT CBM 86' file."
