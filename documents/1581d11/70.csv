"what commands are used to read and write relative file data on a C64?","The commands used to read and write relative file data are the same PRINT#, INPUT#, and GET# commands used in sequential file programming, each command is used as described in sequential file programming."
"what is the main difference between relative file access and sequential file programming?","The main difference between relative file access and sequential file programming lies in some aspects of relative file access that differ from sequential file programming, which will be covered in more detail."
"can relative file access be used with sequential file commands?","Yes, relative file access can be used with the same sequential file commands, specifically the PRINT#, INPUT#, and GET# commands, which are used in the same way as in sequential file programming."
"what is the purpose of the PRINT# command in relative file access?","The purpose of the PRINT# command in relative file access is to write data to a file, similar to its use in sequential file programming, but with the added functionality of relative file access."
"how does the GET# command work in relative file access?","The GET# command in relative file access is used to read data from a file, similar to its use in sequential file programming, but with the added functionality of relative file access."
"what is the role of the INPUT# command in relative file access?","The role of the INPUT# command in relative file access is to input data from the user and store it in a file, similar to its use in sequential file programming, but with the added functionality of relative file access."
"can relative file access be used for both reading and writing data?","Yes, relative file access can be used for both reading and writing data, using the same commands as in sequential file programming, specifically the PRINT#, INPUT#, and GET# commands."
"what is the main advantage of using relative file access over sequential file programming?","The main advantage of using relative file access over sequential file programming is the added functionality of being able to access specific parts of a file, rather than having to read or write the entire file."
"is relative file access compatible with all types of files?","Relative file access is compatible with files that support relative access, which is a specific type of file that allows for random access to specific parts of the file."
"what is the key difference between relative file access and sequential file access?","The key difference between relative file access and sequential file access is that relative file access allows for random access to specific parts of a file, whereas sequential file access requires reading or writing the entire file."
