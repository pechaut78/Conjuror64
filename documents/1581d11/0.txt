  The  Commodore 1581  is a versatile 3.5" disk drive that can be
used with a variety of computers,  including  the  COMMODORE 128,
the COMMODORE 64, the Plus 4, COMMODORE 16, and VIC 20.
  Also,  in  addition to the convenience of 3.5" disks,  the 1581
offers the following features:

  o Standard  and  fast  serial data transfer rates  --  The 1581
    automatically selects the proper data transfer rate  (fast or
    slow) to match the operating modes available on the Commodore
    128 computer.

  o Double-sided, double-density MFM data recording  --  Provides
    more than 800K formatted storage capacity per disk (400K+ per
    side).

  o Special high-speed burst commands -- These commands, used for
    machine language programs, transfer data several times faster
    than the standard or fast serial rates.
