1581 disk: EXPANDING A RELATIVE FILE

  If  you  underestimate your needs and want to expand a relative
file later, simply request the record number you need, even if it
doesn't  currently exist in the file.  If there is no such record
yet,  DOS  will create it as soon as you try to write information
in  it,  and  also automatically create any other missing records
below it in number.  When the first record beyond the current end
record  is  written,  the  DOS  returns  "50, RECORD NOT PRESENT"
error. This is expected and correct.
