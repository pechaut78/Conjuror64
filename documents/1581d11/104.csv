"what is the purpose of the C bit in the status byte?","The C bit is used to indicate a change in the status. When C=1 and W=0, it means log in disk, and when C=1 and W=1, it returns whether the disk was logged, i.e. $B error or old status."
"what is the function of the W bit in the status byte?","The W bit is the write switch, where 0 indicates write is allowed and 1 indicates write is not allowed. It is also used in the protocol, where W=1 indicates a burst handshake and W=0 indicates a conventional protocol."
"what is the difference between the status bytes 04 and 05?","Status byte 04 is used for a new OR mask with the M-bit set, while status byte 05 is used for a new AND mask with the M-bit set."
"how is the drive number represented in the status byte?","The drive number is represented by the N bit in the status byte."
"what is the purpose of the M bit in the status byte?","The M bit is used to indicate whether a write AND/OR mask is set. When M=1, it indicates a new mask value."
"what is the output of the status byte when W=0?","When W=0, there is no output, as it is a conventional protocol."
"what is the output of the status byte when W=1?","When W=1, the output is a burst status byte."
"what is the purpose of the burst handshake protocol?","The burst handshake protocol is used to read or write the current status, and to change the status mask value."
"how is the log in disk operation performed?","The log in disk operation is performed by setting C=1 and W=0 in the status byte."
"what is the error code returned when the disk was not logged?","The error code returned when the disk was not logged is $B."
