"What is the format of the BLOCK-EXECUTE command?","The format of the BLOCK-EXECUTE command is PRINT#15,\"B-E:\";channel#;drive#;track#;sector#, where channel# is the channel number specified when the file into which the block will be loaded was opened, drive# is the drive number, and track# and sector# are respectively the track and sector numbers containing the desired block of data to be loaded into the file buffer and executed there."
"What are the alternate formats of the BLOCK-EXECUTE command?","The alternate formats of the BLOCK-EXECUTE command are PRINT#15,\"B-E:\";channel#;drive#;track#;sector# and PRINT#15,\"B-E:channel#,drive#,track#,sector#\"."
"How do you open a command channel for the BLOCK-EXECUTE command?","You open a command channel for the BLOCK-EXECUTE command using the OPEN 15,8,15 command, where 15 is the channel number."
"How do you open a direct access channel to a buffer for the BLOCK-EXECUTE command?","You open a direct access channel to a buffer for the BLOCK-EXECUTE command using the OPEN 2,8,2,\"#1\" command, where 2 is the channel number and #1 is the buffer number."
"What is the purpose of the PRINT#15,\"B-E:\";2;0;1;8 command?","The purpose of the PRINT#15,\"B-E:\";2;0;1;8 command is to load Track 1, Sector 8 into buffer 1 and execute it."
"How do you tidy up after executing a BLOCK-EXECUTE command?","You tidy up after executing a BLOCK-EXECUTE command by closing the direct access channel to the buffer using the CLOSE 2 command and closing the command channel using the CLOSE 15 command."
"What is the significance of the RTS instruction in the BLOCK-EXECUTE command?","The RTS instruction marks the end of the machine language routine executed by the BLOCK-EXECUTE command."
"In what memory location does the BLOCK-EXECUTE command load the machine language routine?","The BLOCK-EXECUTE command loads the machine language routine into a memory buffer starting at $0400 hexadecimal."
"What is the purpose of the channel number in the BLOCK-EXECUTE command?","The purpose of the channel number in the BLOCK-EXECUTE command is to specify the channel number of the file into which the block will be loaded."
