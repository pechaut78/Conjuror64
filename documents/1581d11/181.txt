1581 disk: Controller commands error code 72: DISK FULL
    Either  the  diskette or its directory is full.  DISK FULL is
    sent  when  two  blocks  are  still  available,  allowing the
    current  file  to be closed.  If you get this message and the
    directory  shows any blocks left,  you have too many separate
    files  in  your  directory,  and  will  need to combine some,
    delete any that are no longer needed, or copy some to another
    diskette.
