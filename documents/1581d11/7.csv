"What is the purpose of the error check program in Basic 2.0?","The error check program is used to find out what error has occurred when the red drive light flashes, and it reads the error channel into four BASIC variables, printing the results on the screen and clearing the error from disk memory."
"What are the four BASIC variables used to store error information?","The four BASIC variables used to store error information are EN (Error Number), EM$ (Error Message), ET (Error Track), and ES (Error Sector), with EM$ being the only string variable."
"How do you access the error-checking subroutine in a program?","You access the error-checking subroutine using the BASIC GOSUB command, either in immediate mode or from a program, and the RETURN statement will jump back to immediate mode or the next statement in your program."
"What does error number 0 indicate?","Error number 0 indicates that everything is OK, meaning there are no errors."
"What does error number 1 indicate?","Error number 1 indicates how many files were erased by a SCRATCH command."
"What happens when the error status is anything else besides 0 or 1?","When the error status is anything else besides 0 or 1, line 60000 prints the error message and halts the program."
"What is the purpose of the CLOSE 15 statement in the error check program?","The purpose of the CLOSE 15 statement is to close the error channel after reading the error information."
"What is the purpose of the OPEN 15,8,15 statement in the error check program?","The purpose of the OPEN 15,8,15 statement is to open the error channel for reading, allowing the program to access the error information."
"How do you use the error-checking subroutine in a program?","You can use the error-checking subroutine in a program by including the code snippet 59980 REM READ ERROR CHANNEL, 59990 INPUT#15,EN,EM$,ET,ES, 60000 IF EN>1 THEN PRINT EN,EM$,ET,ES: STOP, 60010 RETURN, and calling it with the GOSUB command."
"What happens when the red drive light flashes in Basic 2.0?","When the red drive light flashes in Basic 2.0, you must write a small program to find out what the error is, which causes you to lose any program variables already in memory."
