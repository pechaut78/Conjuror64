"what happens to data in a memory buffer when writing a file?","During the process of writing a file, data is accumulated in a memory buffer, and only written out to the diskette when the buffer fills, and there is almost always a small amount of data in the buffer that has not been written to diskette yet, and which would simply be lost if the computer system were turned off."
"why is it important to close a file after using it?","It is extremely important to close a file after using it because if the computer system were turned off, the data in the buffer would be lost, and also diskette housekeeping matters such as updating the BAM of sectors used by the current file would not be performed, which could cause loss of the entire file."
"what happens when a file is closed?","When a file is closed, the rest of the data buffer is written out to diskette, the BAM is updated, and the file's entry in the directory is completed."
"what would happen if a file is not closed after use?","If a file is not closed after use, the data in the buffer would be lost, and the file's entry in the directory would not be completed, which could cause loss of the entire file."
"what is the purpose of the CLOSE statement?","The purpose of the CLOSE statement is to write the rest of the data buffer out to diskette, update the BAM, and complete the file's entry in the directory when a file is no longer in use."
"why should the command channel be the first file opened and the last file closed?","The command channel should be the first file opened and the last file closed because it is necessary to ensure that all other files are properly closed before closing the command channel."
"what is the BAM?","The BAM stands for Block Availability Map, which is a data structure that keeps track of the sectors used by a file on the diskette."
"what happens to the BAM when a file is closed?","When a file is closed, the BAM is updated to reflect the sectors used by the file."
"why is it necessary to update the BAM?","It is necessary to update the BAM to ensure that the diskette's file system is kept in a consistent state, and to prevent data loss or corruption."
"what is the consequence of not closing a file after use?","The consequence of not closing a file after use is that the data in the buffer would be lost, and the file's entry in the directory would not be completed, which could cause loss of the entire file."
