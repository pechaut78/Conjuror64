"What is the format for the INPUT# statement in BASIC 7.0?","The format for the INPUT# statement in BASIC 7.0 is INPUT#file#,variable list, where 'file#' is the same file number given in the desired file's current OPEN statement, and 'variable list' is one or more valid BASIC variable names."
"What is the purpose of separating variable names with commas in the INPUT# statement?","The purpose of separating variable names with commas in the INPUT# statement is to input more than one data element at a time, where each variable name must be separated from others by a comma."
"How can you read back in the grades written with the PRINT# example?","You can read back in the grades written with the PRINT# example by using a FOR loop and an INPUT# statement, such as 'FOR CLASS = 1 TO COURSES: INPUT#1,GRADE$(CLASS): GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS: NEXT CLASS'."
"What is the safest way to read back in the address data written by another PRINT# example?","The safest way to read back in the address data written by another PRINT# example is to use separate INPUT# statements for each variable, such as 'INPUT#5,NAME$: GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS: INPUT#5,STREET$: GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS: INPUT#5,CITY$: GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS'."
"Why do some programs use a single INPUT# statement to read multiple variables at once?","Some programs use a single INPUT# statement to read multiple variables at once, such as 'INPUT#5,NAME$,STREET$,CITY$', primarily when top speed in the program is essential, and there is little risk of reading improper data from the file."
"What is the purpose of the GOSUB 59990 statement in the INPUT# example?","The purpose of the GOSUB 59990 statement in the INPUT# example is to check for disk errors, by calling a subroutine that checks for errors and handles them accordingly."
"How does the INPUT# statement handle multiple data elements?","The INPUT# statement handles multiple data elements by separating each variable name with a comma, allowing the program to input multiple values at once."
"What is the relationship between the file number in the OPEN statement and the file number in the INPUT# statement?","The file number in the OPEN statement must be the same as the file number in the INPUT# statement, in order to read data from the correct file."
"What is the purpose of using a FOR loop with the INPUT# statement?","The purpose of using a FOR loop with the INPUT# statement is to read data from a file multiple times, such as reading grades for multiple classes or students."
"Why is it important to check for disk errors when using the INPUT# statement?","It is important to check for disk errors when using the INPUT# statement because it ensures that the data read from the file is valid and can be used by the program, and prevents errors or crashes that may occur if the data is invalid or corrupted."
