  DSAVE "@file name"[,Ddrive#][,Udevice#]

  The  actual  procedure  is  this  --  the  new version is saved
completely,  then  the old version is scratched and its directory
entry altered to point to the new version.  Because it works this
way,  there  is little danger a disaster such as having the power
going  off  midway through the process would destroy both the old
and new copies of the file. Nothing happens to the old copy until
after the new copy is saved properly.
