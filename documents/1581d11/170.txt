1581 disk: Controller commands error code 52: FILE TOO LARGE
    There isn't room left on the diskette to create the requested
    relative record.  To avoid this error, create the last record
    number  that  will be needed as you first create the file. If
    the file is too large for the diskette,  either split it into
    two files on two diskettes,  or use abbreviations in the data
    to allow shorter records.
