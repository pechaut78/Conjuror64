1581 disk: WRITING RELATIVE FILE DATA

  The commands used  to read and write relative file data are the
same  PRINT#,  INPUT#,  and  GET# commands  used in the preceding
chapter  on  sequential files.  Each command is used as described
there.  However,  some  aspects of relative file access do differ
from  sequential  file  programming,  and  we  will  cover  those
differences here.
