"What does error code 70 indicate in a 1581 disk controller command?","Error code 70, NO CHANNEL, indicates that the requested channel is not available or all channels are in use, which can occur when the maximum number of allowed files are already opened, including a maximum of three sequential files or one relative file plus one sequential file, plus the command channel."
"What is the maximum number of sequential files that can be opened at one time on a 1581 disk controller?","The maximum number of sequential files that can be opened at one time on a 1581 disk controller is three, plus one relative file, plus the command channel, and it is important to include the drive number in the sequential OPEN command to avoid limitations."
"Why is it important to include the drive number in a sequential OPEN command on a 1581 disk controller?","Including the drive number in a sequential OPEN command on a 1581 disk controller is important because omitting it would limit the number of sequential files that can be opened to only two, which is a significant restriction."
"What happens if you omit the drive number in a sequential OPEN command on a 1581 disk controller?","If you omit the drive number in a sequential OPEN command on a 1581 disk controller, you will only be able to open a maximum of two sequential files, which is a significant limitation."
"What is the purpose of the command channel on a 1581 disk controller?","The command channel on a 1581 disk controller is a special channel reserved for commands and is always available, in addition to the channels used for files, and it is important to keep in mind when managing file openings."
"How many files can be opened at one time on a 1581 disk controller, including the command channel?","A maximum of three sequential files or one relative file plus one sequential file, plus the command channel, can be opened at one time on a 1581 disk controller."
"What is the importance of closing files as soon as they are no longer needed on a 1581 disk controller?","Closing files as soon as they are no longer needed on a 1581 disk controller is important because it releases the channel, making it available for other files, and helps to avoid the NO CHANNEL error code 70."
"What is the consequence of not closing files on a 1581 disk controller?","Not closing files on a 1581 disk controller can lead to the NO CHANNEL error code 70, as the channels remain occupied, limiting the ability to open new files."
"What is the relationship between the number of opened files and the availability of channels on a 1581 disk controller?","The number of opened files on a 1581 disk controller directly affects the availability of channels, as each opened file occupies a channel, and when all channels are in use, the NO CHANNEL error code 70 occurs."
"How can you avoid the NO CHANNEL error code 70 on a 1581 disk controller?","You can avoid the NO CHANNEL error code 70 on a 1581 disk controller by closing files as soon as they are no longer needed, including the drive number in sequential OPEN commands, and being mindful of the maximum number of allowed files."
