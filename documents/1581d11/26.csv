"what is the limitation of the DSAVE command in commodore 64 basic 7.0?","The limitation of the DSAVE command in Commodore 64 Basic 7.0 is that it will not work with machine-language programs that are not written in BASIC. To copy these programs, you can use the BSAVE command or the built-in Monitor S command."
"what is the purpose of the DSAVE command in commodore 64 basic 7.0?","The purpose of the DSAVE command in Commodore 64 Basic 7.0 is to save programs written in BASIC. It allows users to save their BASIC programs to a disk or other storage device."
"what is the alternative to the DSAVE command for machine-language programs?","The alternative to the DSAVE command for machine-language programs is to use the BSAVE command or the built-in Monitor S command.
