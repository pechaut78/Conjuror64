question,answer
"what is the resolution of the high resolution screen on the C64?","The high resolution screen on the C64 is 320 dots wide by 200 dots high."
"how would you logically number the screen on the C64?","The obvious way to number the screen would be to have the top left corner as 0,0 and then number the X direction from 0 to 319 and the Y direction from 0 to 199."
"what is the physical organisation of the high resolution screen memory on the C64?","The physical screen numbering is different from the logical numbering system, as shown in Figure 7.2."
"why do we need a conversion routine when drawing on the high resolution screen on the C64?","We need a conversion routine because the logical numbering system is the one we want to use for drawing on the high resolution screen, but the high resolution screen memory isn't organised in this way."
"what is the difference between the logical and physical screen numbering on the C64?","The logical screen numbering has the top left corner as 0,0 and then numbers the X direction from 0 to 319 and the Y direction from 0 to 199, whereas the physical screen numbering is different, as shown in Figure 7.2."
"what is the purpose of the conversion routine in relation to the screen organisation on the C64?","The purpose of the conversion routine is to convert from the logical numbering system to the physical screen organisation."
"how does the physical screen organisation differ from the logical screen numbering on the C64?","The physical screen organisation differs from the logical screen numbering in that it does not follow the obvious way of numbering the screen, as shown in Figure 7.2."
"what is the significance of Figure 7.1 in relation to screen organisation on the C64?","Figure 7.1 shows the logical screen numbering, which is the way we want to number the screen for drawing on the high resolution screen."
"what is the significance of Figure 7.2 in relation to screen organisation on the C64?","Figure 7.2 shows the physical screen numbering, which is different from the logical screen numbering."
"why is it important to understand the screen organisation on the C64?","It is important to understand the screen organisation on the C64 because it affects how we draw on the high resolution screen and requires a conversion routine to convert from the logical numbering system to the physical screen organisation."
