"What is the purpose of the SYS statement in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The SYS statement is used to execute a call to a machine code subroutine at a specified address, allowing the programmer to access machine code routines from BASIC."
"How does the SYS statement return control to BASIC?","The machine code subroutine must end with a return from subroutine instruction (RTS) to return control to BASIC, and if the SYS statement is encountered in a BASIC program, control will be passed back to the next statement in the program after the SYS statement."
"What is the range of decimal numbers that can be used with the SYS statement?","The decimal number used with the SYS statement must be in the range of 0 to 65535."
"How can parameters be passed to machine code subroutines using the SYS statement?","Parameters can be passed to machine code subroutines using the BASIC PEEK and POKE facilities to place data in known locations in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE."
"What is the advantage of using multiple SYS statements in a program?","The advantage of using multiple SYS statements in a program is that it allows many separate routines to be accessed from within a single program with ease."
"What is the main difference between the SYS and USR statements?","The main difference between the SYS and USR statements is that USR allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and it allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer, making it a function."
"How does the USR function return a value?","The USR function returns a value by allowing the machine code subroutine to pass a single parameter back as an answer."
"What is the advantage of using the USR function over the SYS statement?","The advantage of using the USR function over the SYS statement is that it allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and it allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer."
"In what circumstances would you use the USR function instead of the SYS statement?","You would use the USR function instead of the SYS statement when you need to pass a single parameter to the machine code subroutine and receive a single parameter back as an answer."
"What is the relationship between the USR function and machine code subroutines?","The USR function is used to access machine code subroutines from BASIC, allowing the programmer to pass a single parameter to the subroutine and receive a single parameter back as an answer."
