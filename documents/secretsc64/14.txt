C64 High Resolutions? 

The first thing we should take a look at is a definition for 
the term high resolution. Well, in the computer world the 
term resolution refers to the number of points on the screen 
which can be individually addressed, 

A low resolution screen is a screen which has a small 
number of individually addressable points. The normai text 
screen is a low resolution screen because it only has 1000 
individual points (40 columns by 25 rows). 

Conversely, a high resolution screen is a screen which has 
a large number of individually addressable points. A screen 
is usually termed high resolution if it has more than 40000 
individual points. The Commodore 64s' screen is 320 dots 
wide by 200 dots high giving 64000 individual points. 

So that we can individually address each of these 64000 
dots they are bit mapped into RAM. This means that each 
of the dots on the screen is controlled by a bit in memory, 
if the bit is a 1 then that dot will be lit, if the bit is a then 
the dot will not be lit. From this we can work out how much memory will be 
needed to store the high resolution screen. As we have seen 
there are 64000 dots on the screen and each byte in RAM 
can control 8 dots (8 bits in a byte), so we will need 8000 
bytes to completely store the screen,
