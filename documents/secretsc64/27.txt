SID Perfect Pitch? 
on C64:
Selecting the correct frequency for a sound is obviously much 
more important for music than is for sound effects. For- 
tunately, the system allows very precise control over the 
frequency so that musical notes can be accurately pitched. 
This fine control is achieved by using a 16 bit value to specify 
the frequency value. Naturally, two registers are needed to 
hold this 16 bit value, these are the High Frequency Control 
register and the Low Frequency Control register. Figure 8.9 
shows where these registers are located for each of the three 
voices. 

Each of the waveform generators can output frequencies 
in the range to 4000 Hz. Within this range of frequencies 
lies a fuU 8 octaves of the musical scale. (About the same 
as a piano, which has a range of 7.5 octaves.) Appendix M 
in the User Manual gives a complete list of the high and low 
frequency values which must be POKE'd into the Frequency 
Control registers to produce the standard musical scale.
