"How does the SYS statement work in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The SYS statement causes the BASIC interpreter to execute a call to a machine code subroutine at a specified address, and control is passed back to the next statement in the program after the SYS statement, or to direct mode if encountered in direct mode, and the machine code subroutine must end with a return from subroutine instruction (RTS)."
"How can parameters be passed to machine code subroutines in Commodore 64 BASIC?","Parameters can be passed to machine code subroutines by using the BASIC PEEK and POKE facilities to place data in known locations in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE."
"What is the advantage of using the SYS statement to access machine code routines in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The advantage of using the SYS statement is that it allows any number of SYS statements in a program, each containing the address of the routine it is to call, making it easy to access many separate routines from within a single program."
"How does the USR function differ from the SYS statement in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The USR function differs from the SYS statement in that it allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer, making it a function that returns a value."
"What is the purpose of the RTS instruction in a machine code subroutine called by the SYS statement in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The purpose of the RTS instruction is to return control to the BASIC interpreter after the machine code subroutine has finished executing, allowing the program to continue executing the next statement."
"How can machine code subroutines be accessed from within a Commodore 64 BASIC program?","Machine code subroutines can be accessed from within a Commodore 64 BASIC program using either the SYS statement or the USR function, both of which allow the program to call a machine code routine at a specified address."
"What is the significance of the address specified in the SYS statement in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The address specified in the SYS statement is the location in memory where the machine code subroutine is located, and the BASIC interpreter will execute a call to this subroutine when the SYS statement is encountered."
"How can data be passed back from a machine code subroutine to a Commodore 64 BASIC program?","Data can be passed back from a machine code subroutine to a Commodore 64 BASIC program by using the USR function, which allows the subroutine to return a single parameter as an answer."
"What is the main advantage of using the USR function over the SYS statement in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The main advantage of using the USR function is that it allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer, making it a function that returns a value."
"In what way does the USR function make it easier to work with machine code subroutines in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The USR function makes it easier to work with machine code subroutines by allowing a single parameter to be passed to the subroutine and allowing the subroutine to return a single parameter as an answer, making it a more flexible and convenient way to access machine code routines."
