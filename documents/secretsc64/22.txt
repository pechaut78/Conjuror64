SOUND on C64

Computer generated sound and music is nothing new. every 
time you turn on a radio you can hear some excellent 
examples of it. Not until fairly recently however, have home 
computers been able to generate high quality sound with any 
degree of control. The sound generator chip fitted to the 
Commodore 64 is one of the most flexible devices currently 
available, and it can be used to produce a wide variety of 
sounds. From a programmers point of view however, this 
extra flexibility can mean extra complexity, because there 
are a large number of parameters which must be specified to 
produce even the simplest of sounds.
