"what is the purpose of the SYS statement in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The SYS statement is used to execute a call to a machine code subroutine at a specified address, allowing the BASIC interpreter to pass control to a machine code routine, and then return to the next statement in the program after the SYS statement."
"how does a machine code subroutine end when called using the SYS statement?","A machine code subroutine ends with a return from subroutine instruction (RTS) when called using the SYS statement, which allows control to be passed back to the next statement in the program."
"can multiple SYS statements be used in a single program?","Yes, any number of SYS statements can be used in a single program, each containing the address of the routine it is to call, allowing many separate routines to be accessed from within a single program with ease."
"how can parameters be passed to machine code subroutines?","Parameters can be passed to machine code subroutines using the BASIC PEEK and POKE facilities to place data in known locations in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE."
"what is the main advantage of using the USR function over the SYS statement?","The main advantage of using the USR function is that it allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and it allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer, making it a function that returns a value."
"what is the difference between the SYS statement and the USR function?","The SYS statement is used to execute a call to a machine code subroutine at a specified address, while the USR function is used to pass a single parameter to a machine code subroutine and receive a single parameter back as an answer."
"can the USR function be used to pass multiple parameters to a machine code subroutine?","No, the USR function can only pass a single parameter to a machine code subroutine and receive a single parameter back as an answer."
"how does the USR function return a value to BASIC?","The USR function returns a value to BASIC as an answer, making it a function that can be used in expressions and assignments."
"in what way is the SYS statement easier to use than the USR function?","The SYS statement is easier to use than the USR function because it does not require the passing of parameters, making it a simpler way to access machine code routines from BASIC."
"what is the advantage of using the SYS statement over the USR function in certain situations?","The advantage of using the SYS statement over the USR function is that it allows any number of SYS statements to be used in a single program, each containing the address of the routine it is to call, making it easier to access multiple machine code routines from a single program."
