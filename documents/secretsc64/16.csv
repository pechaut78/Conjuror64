question,answer
"what is the resolution of the high resolution screen on the C64","The high resolution screen on the C64 is 320 dots wide by 200 dots high, which is the maximum resolution that can be achieved on this system."
"how would you logically number the screen on the C64","The logical way to number the screen would be to have the top left corner as 0,0 and then number the X direction from 0 to 319 and the Y direction from 0 to 199, which is an intuitive and straightforward approach."
"what is the physical organisation of the high resolution screen memory on the C64","The physical organisation of the high resolution screen memory on the C64 is not as straightforward as the logical numbering system, and is shown in Figure 7.2, which highlights the complexity of the physical screen numbering."
"why do we need a conversion routine for drawing on the high resolution screen","We need a conversion routine to convert from the logical numbering system to the physical screen organisation because the high resolution screen memory isn't organised in a logical way, and we want to use the logical numbering system for drawing on the high resolution screen."
"what is the purpose of the conversion routine for the high resolution screen","The purpose of the conversion routine is to convert the logical coordinates to physical coordinates, allowing us to draw on the high resolution screen using the logical numbering system, which is more intuitive and easier to work with."
"what is the difference between the logical and physical screen numbering systems on the C64","The logical screen numbering system is a straightforward and intuitive way of numbering the screen, with the top left corner as 0,0 and increasing in the X and Y directions, whereas the physical screen numbering system is more complex and doesn't follow a straightforward pattern."
"why is the logical numbering system preferred for drawing on the high resolution screen","The logical numbering system is preferred for drawing on the high resolution screen because it is more intuitive and easier to work with, allowing for more efficient and effective drawing and graphics programming."
"what is the significance of Figure 7.1 in the context of screen organisation on the C64","Figure 7.1 shows the logical screen numbering, which is the preferred way of numbering the screen for drawing and graphics programming, and highlights the simplicity and intuitiveness of this approach."
"what is the significance of Figure 7.2 in the context of screen organisation on the C64","Figure 7.2 shows the physical screen numbering, which is the actual organisation of the high resolution screen memory on the C64, and highlights the complexity of the physical screen organisation."
"how does the physical screen organisation affect programming on the C64","The physical screen organisation affects programming on the C64 because it requires a conversion routine to convert from the logical numbering system to the physical screen organisation, which can add complexity to programming and graphics development."
