"what is the trade-off in extended colour mode on C64?","In extended colour mode on C64, you sacrifice horizontal resolution for an increased number of colours, which means that the horizontal dots are now read in pairs so that each pair of dots can be in one of four colours."
"how do the horizontal dots work in extended colour mode?","In extended colour mode, the horizontal dots are read in pairs, allowing each pair of dots to be in one of four colours, as shown in Figure 7.3, which illustrates how the dot pairs are coded into colours."
"what is the benefit of using extended colour mode on C64?","The benefit of using extended colour mode on C64 is that it allows for an increased number of colours, which can enhance the visual quality of graphics and improve the overall aesthetic of the display."
"how are the dot pairs coded into colours in extended colour mode?","The dot pairs are coded into colours in extended colour mode according to the scheme shown in Figure 7.3, which illustrates the specific combinations of dot pairs that correspond to each of the four available colours."
"what is the impact of extended colour mode on horizontal resolution?","The impact of extended colour mode on horizontal resolution is that it reduces the resolution, as the horizontal dots are now read in pairs, which means that the overall horizontal resolution is decreased."
"what is the advantage of using extended colour mode over standard mode?","The advantage of using extended colour mode over standard mode is that it allows for a greater range of colours, which can be particularly useful for creating visually appealing graphics and enhancing the overall display."
"how does the coding of dot pairs work in extended colour mode?","In extended colour mode, the coding of dot pairs works by reading the horizontal dots in pairs, with each pair of dots corresponding to one of four possible colours, as shown in Figure 7.3."
"what is the purpose of Figure 7.3 in the context of extended colour mode?","The purpose of Figure 7.3 is to illustrate how the dot pairs are coded into colours in extended colour mode, providing a visual representation of the specific combinations of dot pairs that correspond to each of the four available colours."
"what is the primary limitation of extended colour mode on C64?","The primary limitation of extended colour mode on C64 is that it sacrifices horizontal resolution in order to achieve the increased number of colours, which can impact the overall display quality."
"how does extended colour mode on C64 compare to standard mode in terms of colour options?","Extended colour mode on C64 offers a greater range of colours compared to standard mode, as it allows for four colours per dot pair, whereas standard mode is limited to two colours per dot."
