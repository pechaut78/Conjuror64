The standard memory map of the C64
the memory map for the standard BASIC configuration 
contains 16K ROM, 6K of system RAM, 38K of BASIC user 
RAM and 4K of other user RAM. Figure l.J shows how all 
this fits into the 64K memory space available.

One of the main advantages to having a 64K RAM machine 
is that you will never have to buy add-on RAM packs just so 
you can play the latest version of Space Zappers or whatever. 
Any software produced for a Commodore 64 will run on 
your machine â€” satisfying, isn't it! 

It is possible however, to get add-on ROM packs, or cart- 
ridges, which contain specialised programs such as games, 
word processors, machine code assemblers etc. The ROM 
cartridges usually contain 8K of ROM which of course, over- 
lays 8K of user RAM. This is usually the 8K from address 
32768 decimal to 40959 decimal, i.e. the top 8K of the 
BASIC program area. 

Even with an 8K ROM cartridge fitted the standard Com- 
modore 64 has a total of 30K of RAM available for BASIC 
programs with a further 4K available for machine code work. 
Compared to many other home computers which only have 
48K or even 32K of RAM fitted as standard (some of which 
will be used by their operating systems and BASIC) the Com- 
modore 64 really does give you more memory for your 
money.
