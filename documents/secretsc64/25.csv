question,answer
"what is dynamic frequency variation on the SID chip?","Dynamic Frequency Variation is a facility on the SID chip that allows the output of one waveform generator to depend on the output of another. This is achieved by using the digital output of waveform generator 3, which produces a digitized version of the wave being generated, to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"how does the digital output of waveform generator 3 work?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 produces a value that varies from 0 to 255 decimal in sympathy with the wave being generated. For example, if a sawtooth wave is being generated, the digital output will vary accordingly. This value can then be used to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"where is the digital output of waveform generator 3 located?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 is located at address 54299 decimal."
"how can you prevent waveform generator 3's output from being audible when using its digital output?","By setting bit 7 of the Filter Mode Control register to 1, you can cut off generator 3's output, preventing it from being audible when using its digital output."
"what is the synchronization facility on the SID chip?","The synchronization facility on the SID chip involves combining the outputs of two waveform generators using the logical AND function, allowing for a range of interesting sounds to be generated, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
"how is the synchronization facility controlled?","The synchronization facility is controlled by bit 1 of the Voice Control register."
"which waveform generators are synchronized by each Voice Control register?","The waveform generators synchronized by each Voice Control register are shown in Figure 8.17."
"what is the purpose of the synchronization facility?","The purpose of the synchronization facility is to provide a range of interesting sounds by combining the outputs of two waveform generators using the logical AND function."
"can the synchronization facility be used on all voices?","Yes, the synchronization facility is available on all voices."
"what type of sounds can be generated using the synchronization facility?","The synchronization facility can be used to generate a range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
