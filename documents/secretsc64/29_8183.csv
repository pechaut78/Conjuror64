"what is the purpose of the SYS statement in commodore 64 BASIC?","The SYS statement is used to execute a call to a machine code subroutine at a specified address, allowing the programmer to access machine code routines from BASIC. The address is specified as a decimal number in the range of 0 to 65535, and the machine code subroutine must end with a return from subroutine instruction (RTS) to return control to BASIC."
"What is the difference between using SYS and USR to access machine code routines from BASIC?","The main difference between SYS and USR is that USR allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer, making it a function. SYS, on the other hand, is a statement that simply calls a machine code subroutine at a specified address."
"How do you pass parameters to a machine code subroutine using SYS?","To pass parameters to a machine code subroutine using SYS, you can use the BASIC PEEK and POKE facilities to place data in known locations in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE."
"What is the advantage of using USR over SYS?","The advantage of using USR over SYS is that USR allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer, making it a function."
"What is the purpose of the RTS instruction in a machine code subroutine?","The RTS (Return from Subroutine) instruction is used to return control to BASIC after a machine code subroutine has been executed. It is necessary for the machine code subroutine to end with an RTS instruction to return control to BASIC."
"How do you return a value from a machine code subroutine using USR?","To return a value from a machine code subroutine using USR, the subroutine can pass a single parameter back as an answer, which is then returned to BASIC as the result of the USR function."
"What is the range of addresses that can be specified in a SYS statement?","The range of addresses that can be specified in a SYS statement is 0 to 65535, which is the range of decimal numbers that can be represented by a 16-bit address."
"How do you use PEEK and POKE to pass parameters to a machine code subroutine?","To use PEEK and POKE to pass parameters to a machine code subroutine, you can use PEEK to retrieve data from a known location in memory and POKE to store data in a known location in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE."
"What happens when a SYS statement is encountered in a BASIC program?","When a SYS statement is encountered in a BASIC program, control is passed to the machine code subroutine at the specified address, and when the subroutine is finished, control is passed back to the next statement in the program."
"What is the difference between using SYS in a program and in direct mode?","When a SYS statement is encountered in a BASIC program, control is passed back to the next statement in the program after the subroutine is finished. When a SYS statement is encountered in direct mode, control is passed back to direct mode."
