"What is the trade-off in extended colour mode on C64?","In extended colour mode on C64, you sacrifice horizontal resolution in order to gain an increased number of colours, which allows for more vivid and detailed graphics."
"How do horizontal dots work in extended colour mode?","In extended colour mode, horizontal dots are read in pairs, allowing each pair of dots to be in one of four colours, which increases the overall colour palette."
"What is the purpose of reading horizontal dots in pairs in extended colour mode?","The purpose of reading horizontal dots in pairs in extended colour mode is to allow each pair of dots to be in one of four colours, which increases the overall colour palette and enables more detailed and vivid graphics."
"How many colours can each pair of dots be in extended colour mode?","Each pair of dots in extended colour mode can be in one of four colours, which increases the overall colour palette and enables more detailed and vivid graphics."
"What is the advantage of using extended colour mode on C64?","The advantage of using extended colour mode on C64 is that it allows for an increased number of colours, which enables more detailed and vivid graphics, making it ideal for applications that require a wider range of colours."
"How does extended colour mode on C64 differ from standard mode?","Extended colour mode on C64 differs from standard mode in that it sacrifices horizontal resolution in order to gain an increased number of colours, whereas standard mode prioritizes horizontal resolution over colour palette."
"What is the relationship between horizontal resolution and colour palette in extended colour mode?","In extended colour mode, there is an inverse relationship between horizontal resolution and colour palette, meaning that as the number of colours increases, the horizontal resolution decreases."
"How does the coding of dot pairs work in extended colour mode?","In extended colour mode, the coding of dot pairs works by reading horizontal dots in pairs, which allows each pair of dots to be in one of four colours, as shown in Figure 7.3."
"What is the significance of Figure 7.3 in understanding extended colour mode?","Figure 7.3 is significant in understanding extended colour mode because it illustrates how the dot pairs are coded into colours, providing a visual representation of how the mode works."
"What is the primary benefit of using extended colour mode on C64?","The primary benefit of using extended colour mode on C64 is that it enables the creation of more detailed and vivid graphics, making it ideal for applications that require a wider range of colours."
