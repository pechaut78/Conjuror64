question,answer
"what is the importance of selecting the correct frequency for a sound in music on C64?","Selecting the correct frequency for a sound is crucial in music on C64 because it allows for precise control over the frequency, enabling accurate pitching of musical notes, which is more important for music than for sound effects."
"how does the C64 system achieve fine control over frequency?","The C64 system achieves fine control over frequency by using a 16-bit value to specify the frequency value, which is held by two registers: the High Frequency Control register and the Low Frequency Control register."
"where are the High Frequency Control register and the Low Frequency Control register located for each of the three voices?","The High Frequency Control register and the Low Frequency Control register are located as shown in Figure 8.9 for each of the three voices."
"what is the range of frequencies that each of the waveform generators can output?","Each of the waveform generators can output frequencies in the range up to 4000 Hz, which covers a full 8 octaves of the musical scale, similar to a piano which has a range of 7.5 octaves."
"what is the purpose of Appendix M in the User Manual?","Appendix M in the User Manual provides a complete list of the high and low frequency values that must be POKE'd into the Frequency Control registers to produce the standard musical scale."
"how many octaves of the musical scale can be covered by the frequency range of the waveform generators?","The frequency range of the waveform generators can cover a full 8 octaves of the musical scale, similar to a piano which has a range of 7.5 octaves."
"what is the significance of using a 16-bit value to specify the frequency value?","Using a 16-bit value to specify the frequency value allows for very precise control over the frequency, enabling accurate pitching of musical notes."
"in what range of frequencies can the waveform generators output sound?","The waveform generators can output sound in the range up to 4000 Hz, which covers a full 8 octaves of the musical scale."
"what are the two registers that hold the 16-bit frequency value?","The two registers that hold the 16-bit frequency value are the High Frequency Control register and the Low Frequency Control register."
"what is the advantage of having fine control over frequency in music on C64?","Having fine control over frequency in music on C64 allows for accurate pitching of musical notes, which is essential for producing high-quality music."
