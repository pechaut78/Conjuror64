To change border and background color on C64:
Two useful screen colour locations are 53280, which 
controls the border colour, and 53281 which controls the 
screen background colour. 

For example, POKE 53280,0 : POKE 53281,0 sets the 
whole screen background to black (which we find much 
more restful!).
