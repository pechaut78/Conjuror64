question,answer
"What is Dynamic Frequency Variation in the SID chip?","Dynamic Frequency Variation is a facility in the SID chip that allows the output of one waveform generator to depend on the output of another. This is achieved by using the digital output of waveform generator 3, which produces a digitized version of the wave being generated, to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"How does the digital output of waveform generator 3 work?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 produces a value that varies from 0 to 255 decimal in sympathy with the wave being generated. For example, if a sawtooth wave is being generated, the digital output will vary accordingly. This value can then be used to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"What is the address of the digital output of waveform generator 3?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 is located at address 54299 decimal."
"How can you silence waveform generator 3 while using its digital output?","By setting bit 7 of the Filter Mode Control register to 1, you can cut off generator 3's output while still using its digital output."
"What is Synchronisation in the SID chip?","Synchronisation is a facility in the SID chip that combines the outputs of two waveform generators using the logical AND function. This can be used to create a range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
"How is Synchronisation controlled in the SID chip?","Synchronisation is controlled by bit 1 of the Voice Control register. Figure 8.17 shows which waveform generators are synchronized by each Voice Control register."
"What is the purpose of Synchronisation in the SID chip?","The purpose of Synchronisation is to combine the outputs of two waveform generators to create new and interesting sounds. This is particularly useful when one of the voices is generating white noise."
"Can Synchronisation be used on all voices in the SID chip?","Yes, Synchronisation is available on all voices in the SID chip."
"What is the advantage of using Synchronisation with white noise?","Using Synchronisation with white noise can create a wide range of interesting and unique sounds."
"How does Synchronisation work with the logical AND function?","Synchronisation works by combining the outputs of two waveform generators using the logical AND function. This allows the creation of new sounds that are not possible with a single waveform generator."
