"How do you execute a machine code subroutine from BASIC on the Commodore 64?","The BASIC statement SYS xxxxx causes the BASIC interpreter to execute a call to a machine code subroutine at address xxxxx, where xxxxx is a decimal number in the range 0-65535, and the machine code subroutine must end with a return from subroutine instruction (RTS) to return to BASIC."
"What happens when a SYS statement is encountered in a BASIC program?","When a SYS statement is encountered in a BASIC program, control will be passed back to the next statement in the program after the SYS statement, and if encountered in direct mode, control will be passed to direct mode."
"How can you pass parameters to a machine code subroutine and return values from it?","You can use the BASIC PEEK and POKE facilities to place data in known locations in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE, allowing parameters to be passed to and returned from the subroutine."
"What is the advantage of using the SYS statement to access machine code routines from BASIC?","The SYS statement is the easiest way of accessing machine code routines from BASIC, as there can be any number of SYS statements in a program, each of which contains the address of the routine it is to call, allowing many separate routines to be accessed from within a single program with ease."
"What is the difference between using SYS and USR to access machine code routines from BASIC?","The main advantage of USR over SYS is that USR allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and it allows the routine to pass a single parameter back as an answer, making it a function, whereas SYS does not have this capability."
"How do you use the USR function to access a machine code subroutine from BASIC?","The USR function is used to access a machine code subroutine from BASIC, allowing a single parameter to be passed to the subroutine and a single parameter to be returned as an answer, making it a function."
"What is the main advantage of using USR over SYS to access machine code routines from BASIC?","The main advantage of USR over SYS is that USR returns a value, making it a function, whereas SYS does not have this capability."
"What is the purpose of the RTS instruction in a machine code subroutine called from BASIC?","The RTS instruction is used to return control to BASIC from a machine code subroutine called from BASIC using the SYS statement."
"How can you use PEEK and POKE to pass parameters to a machine code subroutine?","You can use PEEK and POKE to place data in known locations in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE, allowing parameters to be passed to the subroutine."
"What is the range of addresses that can be used with the SYS statement?","The range of addresses that can be used with the SYS statement is 0-65535, which is the range of decimal numbers that can be used as the address of a machine code subroutine."
