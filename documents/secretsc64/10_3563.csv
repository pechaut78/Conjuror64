question,answer
"what is the main advantage of sprites on the commodore 64","the ease with which they could be moved around the screen"
"what are the registers that hold the current position of the top left hand corner dot of the sprite","the sprite position registers"
"what does the vic chip do with the sprite position registers","it looks at them to find out where the sprites should be"
"what happens when you poke new values into one of the sprite position register pairs","the vic chip will move the sprite from its old position to the new one"
"how is the high resolution screen numbered for sprite positioning purposes","from 24 to 344 in the x direction and from 50 to 250 in the y direction"
"why is the high resolution screen numbered in this way","to allow sprites to be smoothly moved on and off the screen without needing negative position coordinates"
"what happens when a sprite is positioned at 12,50","it will be fully on screen in the y direction and half on screen in the x direction"
"what happens when a sprite is positioned at 0,0","it will be completely off screen in both directions"
"why is there a problem when using large values of x","because the x sprite position registers can only hold numbers in the range to 255"
"what is the solution to the problem of large x values","using an extra register to provide each of the x sprite position registers with an extra high bit, making them 9 bits wide"
"what is the name of the extra register that provides the extra high bit","the most significant bit x register (msbx)"
"what is the address of the msbx register","53264 decimal"
"what do you need to do when setting the x coordinate of a sprite","check if it is larger or smaller than 255 and set the appropriate extra bit accordingly"
"what do you do if the x coordinate is larger than 255","set the appropriate extra bit, subtract 256 from the x coordinate, and store the remainder in the appropriate sprite position x register"
"what do you do if the x coordinate is smaller than 255","reset the appropriate extra bit and store the whole x coordinate in the appropriate sprite position x register"
"what is the purpose of the basic subroutine provided","to set up the sprite position registers correctly, regardless of the size of the x coordinate"
