"What is a Sprite in the context of home computers?","A small, separate, high resolution screen that can be overlaid on the main screen anywhere."
"What is an advantage of using Sprites?","Moving the Sprite around the main screen is fairly simple and doesn't require redrawing the main screen."
"How many Sprites can the Commodore 64's BASIC control at the same time?","Up to eight Sprites."
"What happens when Sprites overlap each other?","The Sprite graphics system allows detection of collisions between Sprites and specification of how they will overlay each other."
"What is a use of collision detection facilities of Sprites?","Enabling implementation of exciting games fairly easily."
"What is a characteristic of a Sprite?","A very flexible graphics object with a lot of built-in intelligence."
"What is the price to pay for using Sprites?","A lot of setting up needs to be done before the Sprite can be used."
"How many bytes of memory are required to store Sprite data?","At least 63 bytes, but the VIC chip assumes 64 bytes."
"Why does the VIC chip assume 64 bytes of memory for each Sprite?","Because 64 is a more convenient number for the computer (64 = 2^6)."
"How does the VIC chip find the address of a Sprite's data?","By multiplying the value in the Sprite Data Pointer by 64."
"What is the range of memory locations that can be used for storing Sprite data?","The first 16K of memory (0 to 16383 decimal)."
"What is a limitation of storing Sprite data in memory?","Many locations within the range cannot be used for Sprite data storage."
"What is one available area for storing Sprite data?","The Cassette I/O buffer (828 decimal to 1023 decimal)."
"How many Sprites can fit in the Cassette I/O buffer?","Three Sprites."
"What is another available area for storing Sprite data?","The BASIC text area (2048 decimal to 40959 decimal)."
"How can space be released in the BASIC text area for Sprite data?","By moving the start of the BASIC text area up a few bytes."
"What is a requirement for moving the start of the BASIC text area?","Typing specific lines in direct mode (cannot be RUN as a program)."
"What happens when Sprites are overlaid in a specific order?","It creates interesting 3D effects."
"What is a benefit of using Sprites in graphics programs?","Impressive graphics can be implemented using fairly short BASIC routines."
"How do Sprites enable game implementation?","By using collision detection facilities, exciting games can be implemented fairly easily."
"What is a consequence of moving a Sprite on the main screen?","The main screen remains unaltered."
"What is a model for understanding Sprites?","A small, separate, high resolution screen that can be overlaid on the main screen."
"What is a use of Sprites in game development?","Detecting collisions between Sprites and specifying how they will overlay each other."
"How many Sprites can be controlled simultaneously by the Commodore 64's BASIC?","Up to eight Sprites."
"What is a characteristic of Sprite graphics?","Flexible and intelligent graphics objects."
"What is a requirement for using Sprites?","A lot of setting up needs to be done before the Sprite can be used."
"How does the VIC chip access Sprite data?","By multiplying the value in the Sprite Data Pointer by 64 to find the address of the first byte of Sprite data."
"What is the size of each Sprite's data in memory?","64 bytes (although only 63 bytes are used)."
"What is a benefit of using Sprites in graphics programming?","Impressive graphics can be implemented using fairly short BASIC routines."
