"what is the purpose of the registers at address 160 to 162 on a C64?","These registers are used as a single 24-bit counter, which increments automatically every 1/60th of a second, serving as a real-time jiffy clock, as mentioned in Chapter 2."
"how does the clock on a C64 work?","The clock on a C64 works by automatically incrementing the 24-bit counter formed by the registers at address 160 to 162 every 1/60th of a second, allowing it to be used as a real-time jiffy clock."
"what is the resolution of the clock on a C64?","The clock on a C64 has a resolution of 1/60th of a second, meaning it increments the 24-bit counter every 1/60th of a second."
"can the clock on a C64 be used as an event timer?","Yes, the clock on a C64 can be used as an event timer by resetting the whole register to 0 and then PEEKing the value after some event has occurred, although the time obtained will only be approximate due to the time it takes to PEEK the values."
"how do you reset the clock on a C64 for use as an event timer?","To use the clock on a C64 as an event timer, you need to reset the whole register to 0, and then PEEK the value after some event has occurred."
"what is the limitation of using the clock on a C64 as an event timer?","The limitation of using the clock on a C64 as an event timer is that the time obtained will only be approximate, due to the time it takes to PEEK the values."
"what is the real-time jiffy clock on a C64 used for?","The real-time jiffy clock on a C64 is used as an event timer, allowing the measurement of time intervals between events, although the time obtained will only be approximate."
"what is the address range of the registers used as a clock on a C64?","The address range of the registers used as a clock on a C64 is 160 to 162."
"how often does the clock on a C64 increment?","The clock on a C64 increments every 1/60th of a second."
"what is the size of the counter used as a clock on a C64?","The size of the counter used as a clock on a C64 is 24 bits."
