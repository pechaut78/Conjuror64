"What is the purpose of the SYS statement in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The SYS statement is used to execute a call to a machine code subroutine at a specified address, allowing the programmer to access machine code routines from BASIC, and is the easiest way to do so as it can be used multiple times in a program to access different routines."
"What is the range of decimal numbers that can be used with the SYS statement?","The range of decimal numbers that can be used with the SYS statement is 0 to 65535, which represents the address in memory where the machine code subroutine is located."
"How does a machine code subroutine end when called using the SYS statement?","A machine code subroutine ends with a return from subroutine instruction (RTS) when called using the SYS statement, which returns control to the next statement in the BASIC program or to direct mode if encountered in direct mode."
"How can parameters be passed to machine code subroutines from BASIC?","Parameters can be passed to machine code subroutines from BASIC by using the PEEK and POKE facilities to place data in known locations in memory that the machine code can access using the machine code equivalents to PEEK and POKE."
"What is the advantage of using the SYS statement over the USR function?","The advantage of using the SYS statement is that it is easier to use and allows for multiple routines to be accessed from within a single program, whereas the USR function is more difficult to use but allows for a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and returned as an answer."
"What is the purpose of the USR function in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The USR function is used to access machine code routines from BASIC, allowing a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and returned as an answer, making it a function that returns a value."
"How does the USR function differ from the SYS statement?","The USR function differs from the SYS statement in that it allows a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and returned as an answer, whereas the SYS statement does not allow for parameter passing or returning."
"What is the main advantage of using the USR function over the SYS statement?","The main advantage of using the USR function is that it allows for a single parameter to be passed to the machine code subroutine and returned as an answer, making it a more flexible and powerful way to access machine code routines from BASIC."
"How can machine code subroutines be accessed from within a single BASIC program?","Machine code subroutines can be accessed from within a single BASIC program using the SYS statement, which can be used multiple times in a program to access different routines."
"What is the role of the RTS instruction in machine code subroutines called using the SYS statement?","The RTS (return from subroutine) instruction is used to end a machine code subroutine called using the SYS statement, returning control to the next statement in the BASIC program or to direct mode if encountered in direct mode."
