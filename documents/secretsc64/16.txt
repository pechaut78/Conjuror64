Screen Organisation and Use on the C64

As we have already mentioned, the high resolution screen is 
320 dots wide by 200 dots high. The obvious way to number 
the screen would be to have the top left corner as 0,0 and 
then number the X direction from to 319 and the Y direc- 
tion from to 199. Figure 7.1 shows this logical screen 
numbering. 

Unfortunately, the high resolution screen memory isn't 
organised in this way. Figure 7.2 shows the physical screen 
numbering. 

Obviously the logical numbering system is the one which 
we want to be using for drawing on the high resolution screen. 
This means that we will need a conversion routine to con- 
vert from the logical numbering system to the physical screen 
organisation.
