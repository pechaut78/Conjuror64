Standard colour mode of the C64

In this mode any dot on the high resolution screen can 
only be in one of two colours. These colours are simply 
taken from the high and low bits of the text screen memory 
as described above. Usually the whole high resolution screen 
will be in the same two colours, which means that the com- 
posite value of the colour can be written all through the text 
screen memory.
