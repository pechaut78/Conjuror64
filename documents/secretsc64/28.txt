Sound Effects 

There are a couple of additional facilities in the SID chip 
which are very useful when generating sound effects. 
(Although they can also be used in music.) 

The first of these is Dynamic Frequency Variation. This 
is achieved by making the output of one of the waveform 
generators dependant upon the output of one of the others.
To make this as simple as possible, waveform generator 3 
has a special digital output which produces a digitised version 
of the wave being generated. 

For example, if a sawtooth wave is being generated then 
the digital output varies from to 255 decimal in sympathy 
with the sawtooth wave. This value can then be used to 
influence the frequency value for one of the other generators. 

This digital output is only available from waveform genera- 
tor 3 and it is located at address 54299 decimal. In addition, 
should you not want the output of generator 3 to be audible 
whilst you are using its digital output, bit 7 of the Filter 
Mode Control register will cut off generator 3's output when it 
is set to 1 . (See Figure 8.1 5.) 

The next special facility' is called Synchronisation and it 
involves the combination of the outputs of two waveform 
generators using the logical AND function. This can be used 
to provide a whole range of very interesting sounds, parti- 
cularly if one of the voices is generating vi'hite noise. 

The synchronisation facility is available on alt the voices 
and it is controlled by bit 1 of the Voice Control register. 
Figure 8.17 shows which waveform generators are syn- 
chronised by each Voice Control register.
