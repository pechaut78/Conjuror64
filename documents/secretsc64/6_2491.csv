question,answer
"what is the purpose of registers at address 160 to 162 on a C64?","these registers are used as a single 24-bit counter to implement a real-time jiffy clock, which increments automatically every 1/60th of a second, as mentioned in Chapter 2."
"how does the clock on a C64 work?","the clock on a C64 works by incrementing the value in the 24-bit counter registers at address 160 to 162 every 1/60th of a second, allowing it to be used as an event timer by resetting the register and then reading its value after an event has occurred."
"what is the real-time jiffy clock on a C64 used for?","the real-time jiffy clock on a C64 is used as an event timer, allowing programmers to measure the time elapsed between events by resetting the clock and then reading its value after the event has occurred."
"what is the resolution of the clock on a C64?","the resolution of the clock on a C64 is 1/60th of a second, meaning it increments every 1/60th of a second."
"how can the clock on a C64 be used to measure time?","the clock on a C64 can be used to measure time by resetting the 24-bit counter registers at address 160 to 162 and then reading their value after a certain event has occurred, allowing programmers to approximate the time elapsed."
"what is the limitation of using the clock on a C64 as an event timer?","the limitation of using the clock on a C64 as an event timer is that the time obtained will only be approximate, because it takes time to read the value of the registers."
"what is the significance of address 160 to 162 on a C64?","the significance of address 160 to 162 on a C64 is that they contain the 24-bit counter registers that implement the real-time jiffy clock, which can be used as an event timer."
"how does one reset the clock on a C64?","one resets the clock on a C64 by setting the value of the 24-bit counter registers at address 160 to 162 to zero, allowing it to be used as an event timer."
"what is the purpose of PEEKing the value of the clock on a C64?","the purpose of PEEKing the value of the clock on a C64 is to read the current value of the 24-bit counter registers at address 160 to 162, allowing programmers to measure the time elapsed since the clock was last reset."
"what is the relationship between the clock on a C64 and Chapter 2?","the clock on a C64 is mentioned in Chapter 2, which provides more information about its implementation and usage as a real-time jiffy clock."
