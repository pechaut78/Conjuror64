question,answer
"what is the main advantage of sprites on the commodore 64","the ease with which they could be moved around the screen"
"what is the purpose of the sprite position registers","to hold the current position of the top left hand corner dot of the sprite on the 320 by 200 dots high resolution screen"
"what chip is responsible for redrawing the display","the VIC chip"
"what happens when you POKE new values into one of the sprite position registers","the VIC chip will move the sprite from its old position to the new one"
"in what range are the x coordinates numbered on the high resolution screen","from 24 to 344"
"in what range are the y coordinates numbered on the high resolution screen","from 50 to 250"
"what is the problem with using large values of x","the x sprite position registers can only hold numbers in the range to 255"
"what is the purpose of the most significant bit x register","to provide each of the x sprite position registers with an extra high bit, making them 9 bits wide"
"what is the address of the most significant bit x register","53264 decimal"
"what do you need to do if the x coordinate is larger than 255","set the appropriate extra bit, subtract 256 from the x coordinate, and store the remainder in the appropriate sprite position x register"
"what do you need to do if the x coordinate is smaller than 255","reset the appropriate extra bit and store the whole x coordinate in the appropriate sprite position x register"
"what is the purpose of the basic subroutine provided","to set up the sprite position registers correctly, regardless of the size of the x coordinate"
"what variables need to be set before calling the basic subroutine","the sprite number in the SN variable, and the x,y coordinate in the X and Y variables"
"what is the range of numbers that a 9 bit register can hold","to 511"
"what is the purpose of the sprite position registers","to hold the location of each sprite on the high resolution screen"
