question,answer
"what is the advantage of sprites on the commodore 64","one of the main advantages of Sprites was the ease with which they could be moved around the screen"
"what are the sprite position registers used for","these registers hold the current position of the top left hand corner dot of the Sprite on the 320 by 200 dots high resolution screen"
"what does the VIC chip do with the sprite position registers","the VIC chip, which is constantly redrawing the display, looks at the Sprite Position registers to find out where the Sprites should be"
"how is the high resolution screen numbered for sprite positioning","the high resolution screen is actually numbered from 24 to 344 in the X direction and from 50 to 250 in the Y direction"
"why is the high resolution screen numbered in this way","it allows Sprites to be smoothly moved on and off the screen without needing negative position coordinates"
"what happens when a sprite is positioned at 12,50","a Sprite positioned at 12,50 will be fully on screen in the Y direction and half on screen in the X direction"
"what happens when a sprite is positioned at 0,0","a Sprite positioned at 0,0 will be completely off screen in both directions"
"why is there a problem with using large values of X","the X Sprite Position registers can only hold numbers in the range to 255, and this is not enough to completely address the 320 dots wide screen"
"what is the solution to the problem of large X values","an extra register is used to provide each of the X Sprite Position registers with an extra high bit, thus making them all 9 bits wide"
"what is the name of the extra register used to solve the X value problem","the Most Significant Bit X register (MSBX for short)"
"where is the MSBX register located","the MSBX register is located at address 53264 decimal"
"what is the purpose of the MSBX register","it provides each of the X Sprite Position registers with an extra high bit, making them all 9 bits wide"
"what do you need to do when the X coordinate is larger than 255","you must set the appropriate extra bit, subtract 256 from the X coordinate, and store the remainder in the appropriate Sprite Position X register"
"what do you need to do when the X coordinate is smaller than 255","you must reset the appropriate extra bit and store the whole X coordinate in the appropriate Sprite Position X register"
"what is the purpose of the BASIC subroutine","it sets up the Sprite Position registers correctly, regardless of the size of the X coordinate"
