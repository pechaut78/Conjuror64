"what is the trade-off in extended colour mode on C64?","In extended colour mode on C64, you sacrifice horizontal resolution for an increased number of colours, allowing for a more vibrant and diverse colour palette."
"how are horizontal dots read in extended colour mode on C64?","In extended colour mode on C64, the horizontal dots are read in pairs, enabling each pair of dots to be in one of four colours, as illustrated in Figure 7.3."
"what is the purpose of reading horizontal dots in pairs in extended colour mode on C64?","The purpose of reading horizontal dots in pairs in extended colour mode on C64 is to increase the number of colours available, allowing for a more detailed and nuanced colour representation."
"what is the result of reading horizontal dots in pairs in extended colour mode on C64?","The result of reading horizontal dots in pairs in extended colour mode on C64 is that each pair of dots can be in one of four colours, as shown in Figure 7.3, allowing for a more diverse and vibrant colour palette."
"how does the horizontal resolution change in extended colour mode on C64?","In extended colour mode on C64, the horizontal resolution is sacrificed, or reduced, in order to accommodate the increased number of colours, allowing for a trade-off between resolution and colour depth."
"what is the benefit of using extended colour mode on C64?","The benefit of using extended colour mode on C64 is that it allows for a more diverse and vibrant colour palette, enabling the creation of more visually appealing and engaging graphics and designs."
"how does the colour representation change in extended colour mode on C64?","In extended colour mode on C64, the colour representation changes from a simple two-colour scheme to a more complex four-colour scheme, where each pair of dots can be in one of four colours, as illustrated in Figure 7.3."
"what is the significance of Figure 7.3 in the context of extended colour mode on C64?","Figure 7.3 is significant in the context of extended colour mode on C64 because it illustrates how the dot pairs are coded into colours, providing a visual representation of the colour encoding process."
"how does the colour encoding process work in extended colour mode on C64?","In extended colour mode on C64, the colour encoding process works by reading horizontal dots in pairs and assigning each pair to one of four colours, as shown in Figure 7.3, allowing for a more diverse and nuanced colour representation."
"in what way does extended colour mode on C64 enhance graphical capabilities?","Extended colour mode on C64 enhances graphical capabilities by allowing for a more diverse and vibrant colour palette, enabling the creation of more visually appealing and engaging graphics and designs."
