Is the C64 64k ? Can I use all the 64k of ram?

What actually happens is that 16K of the ROM overlays 16K 
of RAM. The system is arranged such that you always read 
the information from the ROM and not the RAM underneath 
it. The other 4K of ROM also overlays RAM but this ROM is 
invisible to the user and the 4K of RAM is available for 
programs. 

(It is possible to switch the ROMs in and out of the me- 
mory map to gain extra RAM space. However this is not 
easy, or advisable, from BASIC and so we have not included 
this facility in this book.) 

And Smaller and Smaller and Smaller ... 

What we really have then, is a computer with 48K of RAM 
and 16K of ROM. Unfortunately, not all of this RAM is 
available to us for writing programs. This is because a further 
6K of RAM is required by BASIC and the operating system 
for storing important system information. (Pointers, tables 
etc.) 

We are now down to 42K of RAM which is available to us 
for programs, this is called the user RAM, However, there is 
more to come (or rather, go) because only 38K of the user 
RAM is available for writing BASIC programs. The other 4K 
is available to us, but it cannot be used for storing BASIC 
programs. Us main use is to store machine code routines 
(this is where the BASIC extension program in Chapter 10 
is located).
