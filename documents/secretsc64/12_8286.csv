"what is the main advantage of using sprites for collision detection on the C64?","The main advantage of using sprites for collision detection on the C64 is that it allows for the detection of any number of collisions simply by PEEKing a pair of registers, making it a more efficient and easier process compared to using standard graphics."
"What is the role of the VIC chip in sprite collision detection?","The VIC chip is responsible for detecting sprite collisions and reporting them to the programmer via two collision registers, one for sprite to sprite collisions and one for sprite to background collisions."
"How are sprite to sprite collisions defined?","A sprite to sprite collision has occurred when a non-transparent area of one sprite overlays a non-transparent area of another sprite."
"How are sprite to background collisions defined?","A sprite to background collision has occurred when a non-transparent area of a sprite overlays any background graphics."
"What do the bits in the collision registers represent?","In each register, bit 0 refers to sprite 0, bit 1 refers to sprite 1, and so on, with the VIC chip setting the appropriate bits to 1 for those sprites which have collided."
"How can you determine which sprites have collided using the collision registers?","By PEEKing the registers in the right way, you can determine which sprites have collided, for example, if the Sprite to Sprite Collision register contains 17 decimal (bits 0 and 4 set), it means that sprite 0 has collided with sprite 4."
"What is the significance of the numbers returned by the collision registers?","The numbers returned by the collision registers do not immediately relate to individual sprites, but rather require the programmer to PEEK the registers in the right way to determine which sprites have collided."
"What is the difference between sprite to sprite collisions and sprite to background collisions?","Sprite to sprite collisions occur when two or more sprites overlap, while sprite to background collisions occur when a sprite overlaps with the background graphics."
"How can you use the collision registers to detect missile/target type collisions?","By checking the collision registers, you can detect when a missile (represented by a sprite) has hit a target (also represented by a sprite), allowing for the creation of missile/target type applications."
"What is the default state of the collision registers?","The collision registers are normally set to 0, and the VIC chip sets the appropriate bits to 1 for those sprites which have collided."
