"How does the standard memory map of the C64 allocate its 64K memory space?","The standard memory map of the C64 allocates its 64K memory space into 16K ROM, 6K of system RAM, 38K of BASIC user RAM, and 4K of other user RAM, as shown in Figure 1."
"What is one of the main advantages of having a 64K RAM machine?","One of the main advantages of having a 64K RAM machine is that you will never have to buy add-on RAM packs to run the latest software, as any software produced for a Commodore 64 will run on your machine."
"What are ROM cartridges used for on the Commodore 64?","ROM cartridges, also known as add-on ROM packs, contain specialized programs such as games, word processors, machine code assemblers, and more, which can be used on the Commodore 64."
"How much ROM is typically contained in a ROM cartridge?","A ROM cartridge typically contains 8K of ROM, which overlays 8K of user RAM, usually the top 8K of the BASIC program area from address 32768 decimal to 40959 decimal."
"How much RAM is available for BASIC programs on a Commodore 64 with an 8K ROM cartridge fitted?","Even with an 8K ROM cartridge fitted, the standard Commodore 64 has a total of 30K of RAM available for BASIC programs, with a further 4K available for machine code work."
"How does the Commodore 64 compare to other home computers in terms of RAM?","Compared to many other home computers which only have 48K or even 32K of RAM fitted as standard, the Commodore 64 really does give you more memory for your money, with a total of 64K of RAM available."
"What is the significance of the 8K of ROM in a ROM cartridge?","The 8K of ROM in a ROM cartridge overlays 8K of user RAM, which is usually the top 8K of the BASIC program area from address 32768 decimal to 40959 decimal."
"How does the Commodore 64's memory allocation compare to other computers?","The Commodore 64's memory allocation, with 16K ROM, 6K of system RAM, 38K of BASIC user RAM, and 4K of other user RAM, is more generous than many other home computers, which often have less RAM available for user programs."
"What is the benefit of having more RAM on the Commodore 64?","The benefit of having more RAM on the Commodore 64 is that you can run more complex programs and have more memory available for your own programs and data, making it a more capable and flexible computer."
"How does the Commodore 64's memory allocation support software development?","The Commodore 64's memory allocation, with its generous amount of RAM available for user programs, supports software development by providing a large amount of memory for programmers to work with, making it an attractive platform for developers."
