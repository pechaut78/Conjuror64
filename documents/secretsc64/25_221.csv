question,answer
"What is Dynamic Frequency Variation on the SID chip?","Dynamic Frequency Variation is a facility on the SID chip that allows the output of one waveform generator to depend on the output of another. This is achieved by using the digital output of waveform generator 3, which produces a digitized version of the wave being generated, to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"How does the digital output of waveform generator 3 work?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 produces a value that varies from 0 to 255 decimal in sympathy with the wave being generated. For example, if a sawtooth wave is being generated, the digital output will vary accordingly. This value can then be used to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"What is the address of the digital output of waveform generator 3?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 is located at address 54299 decimal."
"How can you silence waveform generator 3 while using its digital output?","By setting bit 7 of the Filter Mode Control register to 1, you can cut off generator 3's output while still using its digital output."
"What is Synchronisation on the SID chip?","Synchronisation is a facility on the SID chip that combines the outputs of two waveform generators using the logical AND function. This can be used to create a wide range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
"How is the synchronisation facility controlled?","The synchronisation facility is controlled by bit 1 of the Voice Control register."
"On which waveform generators is the synchronisation facility available?","The synchronisation facility is available on all waveform generators."
"How does the Voice Control register affect the synchronisation facility?","The Voice Control register determines which waveform generators are synchronized with each other. Figure 8.17 shows which waveform generators are synchronized by each Voice Control register."
"What is the purpose of using the logical AND function in the synchronisation facility?","The logical AND function is used to combine the outputs of two waveform generators, allowing for the creation of complex and interesting sounds."
"What type of sounds can be created using the synchronisation facility?","The synchronisation facility can be used to create a wide range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
