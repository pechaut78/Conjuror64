53281 decimal and it normally holds the text screen back- 
ground colour. The colour in this register is the same for the 
whole of the high resolution screen, i.e. the high resolution 
screen background must all be the same colour. 

The normal colour memory, which is located at address 

55296 decimal to 56295 decimal, is where the colour for the 
characters on the text screen is normally held. In extended 
colour mode each location can be used to hold the colour 
for an 8 by 8 dots square on the high resolution screen. 

For example, location 55296 holds the colour for any dot 
pairs set to 1 1 in bytes to 7 of the high resolution screen, 

55297 holds the colour for any dot pairs set to 11 in bytes 
8 to 15, and so on. 

To select extended colour mode for the high resolution 
screen you must set bit 4 of the second VIC control register 
which is located at address 53270 decimal. For example, to 
select extended colour mode for the high resoiution screen 
you must use the following POKE: POKE 53270, PEEK
