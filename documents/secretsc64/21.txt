Drawing Complex Shapes on the C64

By using the BASIC PLOT and LINEDRAW routines des- 
cribed above, or the much faster machine code routines 
described in Chapter 10, it is jrossibie to draw almost any 
complex shape. 

All that is required is a coordinate file which holds all 
the necessary drawing coordinates and status information 
such as skip to the next point and end of file. The easiest 
way to store this sort of data is in BASIC DATA statements. 

We can store the X,y coordinates as simple pairs of 
numbers in the range 0—319 for the X coordinate and 0—199 
for the Y coordinate. For the status information we can use 
— 1 to indicate skip to the next point and —2 to indicate the 
end of the file.
