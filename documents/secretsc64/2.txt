Using PEEK and POKE on the Commodore 64 

There are 65536 memory locations on the Commodore 64 and you can PEEK values from and POKE values to most of them. (It is not possible to POKE new values into Read Only Memory areas like the BASIC interpreter at address 40960 to 49151.) 
POKEing values into most addresses is usually not particularly rewarding (the machine just "hangs"). Some special locations however, can be used to good advantage. 

exemples:

POKE 53272, 23 
switches to lower case. 

In addition:
POKE 53272, 21 
switches back to upper case.

These two POKEs can be very useful for making text based programs look much neater. 

1024 decimal is the lop left corner. To print on, say, the second space of the next line down (41 characters away from the top left corner) you should POKE 1065, 
value. 

If you like, you can use two variables X and Y to point to the screen locations for you. X must remain in the range to 39 and Y must remain in the range to 24. Any location on screen can then be calculated from 
L0CATlON=Y*40+X+1024.
