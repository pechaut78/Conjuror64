THE HIGH RESOLUTION SCREEN of the C64

The Commodore 64's higii resolution screen is something of 
an enigma, because the User Manual tells you absolutely 
nothing about it! In fairness to Commodore however, this 
may be because the high resolution screen is not an easy 
facility to learn to use, the User Manual is aimed at a very 
basic level. 

So, in this chapter we will remedy these omissions by 
explaining what the high resolution screen is, where it can be 
located and how you can use it. We have also included many 
short subroutines that will help you to drive the high resolu- 
tion facilities.
