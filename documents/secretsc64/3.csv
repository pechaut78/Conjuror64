"what happens when you poke to the screen on a commodore 64","when you poke to the screen on a commodore 64, you also have to remember to poke the appropriate character colour into the colour memory, which is a crucial step in the process, as it ensures that the characters are displayed with the correct colours, otherwise the screen would not display the desired output, and the colours would be incorrect, which would affect the overall appearance of the screen."
"what does the basic print statement do when printing to the screen","the basic print statement, when printing to the screen, automatically takes care of poking the appropriate character colour into the colour memory, which is a convenient feature that saves the programmer from having to manually poke the colours, making it easier to print to the screen and focus on other aspects of the program."
"why is it important to poke the colour memory when printing to the screen","it is important to poke the colour memory when printing to the screen because it allows the characters to be displayed with the correct colours, which is essential for a visually appealing and readable output, and if the colours are not poked correctly, the screen would display incorrect colours, which would be undesirable."
"what would happen if you didn't poke the colour memory when printing to the screen","if you didn't poke the colour memory when printing to the screen, the characters would not be displayed with the correct colours, which would result in an undesirable output, and the screen would display incorrect colours, which would affect the overall appearance of the screen."
"what is the purpose of the colour memory in the commodore 64","the purpose of the colour memory in the commodore 64 is to store the colour information for each character on the screen, which allows the characters to be displayed with the correct colours, and is an essential part of the screen display process."
"how does the basic print statement handle colour memory","the basic print statement handles colour memory by automatically poking the appropriate character colour into the colour memory, which saves the programmer from having to manually poke the colours, making it easier to print to the screen and focus on other aspects of the program."
"what is the relationship between poking to the screen and colour memory","there is a direct relationship between poking to the screen and colour memory, as poking to the screen requires poking the appropriate character colour into the colour memory, which is essential for displaying characters with the correct colours on the screen."
"why do you need to poke the colour memory when using the poke command","you need to poke the colour memory when using the poke command because the poke command only pokes the character data, and does not automatically poke the colour data, which means that the programmer must manually poke the colour memory to ensure that the characters are displayed with the correct colours."
"what is the consequence of not poking the colour memory when using the poke command","the consequence of not poking the colour memory when using the poke command is that the characters would be displayed with incorrect colours, which would affect the overall appearance of the screen, and would require additional programming to correct."
"can the basic print statement be used to poke the colour memory","no, the basic print statement cannot be used to poke the colour memory, as it only prints to the screen and does not provide direct access to the colour memory, which means that the programmer must use the poke command to manually poke the colour memory."
