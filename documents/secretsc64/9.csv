"What is a sprite in the context of home computers?","A small, separate, high resolution screen that can be overlaid on the main screen anywhere."
"What is an advantage of using sprites?","Moving the sprite around the main screen is fairly simple and doesn't require redrawing the main screen."
"How many sprites can the Commodore 64's BASIC control at the same time?","Up to eight sprites."
"What happens when sprites overlap each other?","The sprite graphics system allows detection of collisions between sprites and specification of how they will overlay each other."
"What is a use of collision detection facilities of sprites?","Enabling implementation of exciting games fairly easily."
"What is a characteristic of a sprite?","A very flexible graphics object with a lot of built-in intelligence."
"What is the price to pay for using sprites?","A lot of setting up needs to be done before the sprite can be used."
"How many bytes of memory are required to store sprite data?","At least 63 bytes, but the VIC chip assumes 64 bytes."
"Why does the VIC chip assume 64 bytes of memory for sprite data?","Because 64 is a more convenient number for computers (64 = 2^6)."
"How does the VIC chip find the address of sprite data?","By multiplying the value in the Sprite Data Pointer by 64."
"What is the range of memory locations that can be used for storing sprite data?","The first 16K of memory (0 to 16383 decimal)."
"What are the two available areas for storing sprite data?","The Cassette I/O buffer and the BASIC text area."
"What is the Cassette I/O buffer used for?","By the cassette recorder during LOAD, SAVE, PRINT*, and INPUT* operations."
"How many sprites can fit in the Cassette I/O buffer?","Three sprites."
"What is the BASIC text area used for?","By the BASIC program."
"How can space be released for sprite data in the BASIC text area?","By moving the start of the BASIC text area up a few bytes."
"What is a limitation of moving the start of the BASIC text area?","You can't RUN this as a program because as soon as you start to move the bottom of BASIC you will lose the program."
"What is a use of sprites in graphics programs?","Creating very impressive graphics programs using fairly short BASIC routines."
"How do sprites enable 3D effects?","By overlaying sprites in a specific order."
"What is a benefit of using sprites in games?","Enabling implementation of exciting games fairly easily."
"What is a characteristic of sprite graphics?","Flexible and intelligent graphics objects."
"How do sprites simplify graphics programming?","By allowing for easy movement and collision detection."
"What is a requirement for using sprites?","Setting up the sprite data before use."
"How does the VIC chip store sprite data?","In a 64-byte block of memory."
"What is the purpose of the Sprite Data Pointer?","To point to the location of the sprite data in memory."
"How does the VIC chip calculate the address of sprite data?","By multiplying the Sprite Data Pointer value by 64."
"What is a limitation of sprite data storage?","It can only be stored in the first 16K of memory."
"What is a use of sprites in animation?","Creating smooth and efficient animations."
"How do sprites improve game development?","By enabling easy implementation of exciting games."
"What is a benefit of using sprites in graphics?","Creating very impressive graphics programs using fairly short BASIC routines."
