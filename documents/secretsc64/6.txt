clock on C64
registers at address 160 to 162 are used 
as a single 24 bit counter. The value in this super register 
is incremented automatically every l/60th of a second. This 
is the real time jiffy clock mentioned in Chapter 2. 

This clock can be used as an event timer by resetting the 
whole register to and then PEEKing the value after some 
event has occurred. (Because it takes time to PEEK the 
values the time obtained will only be approximate.)
