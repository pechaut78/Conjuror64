xtended colour mode on C64

In this mode you sacrifice horizontal resolution for an 
Increased number of colours. Instead of every dot being in 
one of two colours, the horizontal dots are now read in pairs 
so that each pair of dots can be in one of four colours. Figure 
7.3 shows how the dot pairs are code into colours.
