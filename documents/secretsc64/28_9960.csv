question,answer
"what is dynamic frequency variation in the SID chip?","Dynamic Frequency Variation is a facility in the SID chip that allows the output of one waveform generator to depend on the output of another. This is achieved by using the digital output of waveform generator 3, which produces a digitized version of the wave being generated. This digital output can then be used to influence the frequency value of one of the other generators."
"how does the digital output of waveform generator 3 work?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 produces a value that varies from 0 to 255 decimal in sympathy with the wave being generated. For example, if a sawtooth wave is being generated, the digital output will vary accordingly. This value can then be used to influence the frequency value of one of the other generators."
"where is the digital output of waveform generator 3 located?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 is located at address 54299 decimal."
"how can you silence waveform generator 3 while still using its digital output?","By setting bit 7 of the Filter Mode Control register to 1, you can cut off the audible output of waveform generator 3 while still using its digital output."
"what is synchronization in the SID chip?","Synchronization is a facility in the SID chip that involves combining the outputs of two waveform generators using the logical AND function. This can be used to provide a range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
"how is synchronization controlled in the SID chip?","Synchronization is controlled by bit 1 of the Voice Control register. This determines which waveform generators are synchronized with each other."
"which waveform generators are synchronized by each Voice Control register?","The specific waveform generators synchronized by each Voice Control register are shown in Figure 8.17."
"what is the purpose of the logical AND function in synchronization?","The logical AND function is used to combine the outputs of two waveform generators, allowing for the creation of complex and interesting sounds."
"can synchronization be used on all voices in the SID chip?","Yes, the synchronization facility is available on all voices in the SID chip."
"what type of sounds can be generated using synchronization?","Synchronization can be used to generate a range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
