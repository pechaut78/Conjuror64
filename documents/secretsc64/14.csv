question,answer
"What is the definition of resolution in the computer world?","In the computer world, the term resolution refers to the number of points on the screen which can be individually addressed."
"What is a low resolution screen?","A low resolution screen is a screen which has a small number of individually addressable points, such as the normal text screen which has only 1000 individual points (40 columns by 25 rows)."
"What is a high resolution screen?","A high resolution screen is a screen which has a large number of individually addressable points, typically more than 40000 individual points."
"What is the resolution of the Commodore 64's screen?","The Commodore 64's screen is 320 dots wide by 200 dots high, giving a total of 64000 individual points."
"How are the dots on the screen controlled?","Each of the dots on the screen is controlled by a bit in memory, if the bit is a 1 then that dot will be lit, if the bit is a 0 then the dot will not be lit."
"What is bit mapping in the context of the Commodore 64's screen?","Bit mapping refers to the process of controlling each of the dots on the screen by a bit in memory, where each byte in RAM can control 8 dots (8 bits in a byte)."
"How much memory is needed to store the high resolution screen?","To completely store the high resolution screen, 8000 bytes of memory are needed, since there are 64000 dots on the screen and each byte in RAM can control 8 dots."
"What is the advantage of having a high resolution screen?","Having a high resolution screen allows for more detailed and precise graphics, as well as a more detailed and nuanced display."
"How does the Commodore 64's screen resolution compare to other computers?","The Commodore 64's screen resolution of 64000 individual points is relatively high compared to other computers of its time, making it well-suited for graphics-intensive applications."
"What are the implications of having a high resolution screen for programming?","Having a high resolution screen requires more memory to store the screen data, and also requires more complex programming to manipulate and control the individual dots on the screen."
