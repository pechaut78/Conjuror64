"what is the resolution of the high resolution screen on the C64?","The high resolution screen on the C64 is 320 dots wide by 200 dots high, which is the maximum resolution that can be achieved on the Commodore 64."
"how would you logically number the screen on the C64?","The logical way to number the screen would be to have the top left corner as 0,0 and then number the X direction from 0 to 319 and the Y direction from 0 to 199, as shown in Figure 7.1."
"what is the physical organisation of the high resolution screen memory on the C64?","The physical organisation of the high resolution screen memory on the C64 is not the same as the logical numbering system, as shown in Figure 7.2, and requires a conversion routine to convert from the logical numbering system to the physical screen organisation."
"why do we need a conversion routine for drawing on the high resolution screen on the C64?","We need a conversion routine because the logical numbering system is the one we want to use for drawing on the high resolution screen, but the physical screen memory is not organised in the same way, so we need to convert from the logical to the physical organisation."
"what is the purpose of Figure 7.1?","Figure 7.1 shows the logical screen numbering, which is the way we would logically number the screen, with the top left corner as 0,0 and then number the X direction from 0 to 319 and the Y direction from 0 to 199."
"what is the purpose of Figure 7.2?","Figure 7.2 shows the physical screen numbering, which is the actual organisation of the high resolution screen memory on the C64, and is different from the logical numbering system."
"how does the physical screen organisation differ from the logical numbering system?","The physical screen organisation differs from the logical numbering system in that it is not a straightforward numbering of the screen, but rather a more complex organisation that requires a conversion routine to access the screen memory."
"what is the significance of the top left corner on the C64 screen?","The top left corner of the C64 screen is significant because it is the reference point for the logical numbering system, and is designated as 0,0."
"why is it important to understand the screen organisation on the C64?","It is important to understand the screen organisation on the C64 because it is necessary to access the screen memory correctly, and to be able to draw on the high resolution screen, which requires a conversion routine to convert from the logical numbering system to the physical screen organisation."
"what is the relationship between the logical and physical screen organisation on the C64?","The logical and physical screen organisation on the C64 are two different ways of numbering the screen, with the logical system being the way we would logically number the screen, and the physical system being the actual organisation of the screen memory, and a conversion routine is needed to convert from one to the other."
