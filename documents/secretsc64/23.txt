An Outline of the Commodore Sound System 

The Commodore 64 sound system is controlled by the Sound 
Interface Device, or SID chip for short. Internally it contains 
three completely separate sound sources called voices. Figure 
8.1 shows how the three voices are organised. 

Each of the voices can generate four different waveforms 
over the frequency range to 4000 Hz. Each waveform has a 
different wave shape and produces different harmonics. The 
four waveforms are, Triangular, Sawtooth, Rectangular and 
White noise. Figure 8.2 shows the general shape of each of 
these waveforms. 

The envelope shapers control the shape of the sound by 
applying user specified values for the sustain level and the 
attack, decay and release rates (called the ADSR envelope). 
Figure 8.3. shows a typical ADSR envelope. 

The outputs of the three envelope shapers are then brought 
together and fed into the tone filtering stage. Filtering is 
used to remove unwanted frequencies from the sound (mainly 
used for specific sound effects). There are three types of 
filter available, a High pass filter which rejects frequencies 
below the cutoff, a Low pass filter which rejects frequencies 
above the cutoff and a Band pass filter which rejects fre- 
quencies both above and below the cutoff.
