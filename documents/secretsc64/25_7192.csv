question,answer
"What is Dynamic Frequency Variation in the SID chip?","Dynamic Frequency Variation is a facility in the SID chip that allows the output of one waveform generator to depend on the output of another. This is achieved by using the digital output of waveform generator 3, which produces a digitized version of the wave being generated, to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"How does the digital output of waveform generator 3 work?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 varies from 0 to 255 decimal in sympathy with the wave being generated. For example, if a sawtooth wave is being generated, the digital output will vary accordingly. This value can then be used to influence the frequency value of another generator."
"What is the address of the digital output of waveform generator 3?","The digital output of waveform generator 3 is located at address 54299 decimal."
"How can you prevent waveform generator 3's output from being audible while using its digital output?","By setting bit 7 of the Filter Mode Control register to 1, you can cut off generator 3's output while still using its digital output."
"What is Synchronisation in the SID chip?","Synchronisation is a facility in the SID chip that involves combining the outputs of two waveform generators using the logical AND function. This can be used to create a range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise."
"How is the synchronisation facility controlled?","The synchronisation facility is controlled by bit 1 of the Voice Control register."
"Which waveform generators are synchronized by each Voice Control register?","Figure 8.17 shows which waveform generators are synchronized by each Voice Control register."
"What is the purpose of the Filter Mode Control register?","The Filter Mode Control register is used to control the output of waveform generator 3, among other things. Setting bit 7 of this register to 1 will cut off generator 3's output while still allowing its digital output to be used."
"How can you use the digital output of waveform generator 3 to create dynamic sound effects?","You can use the digital output of waveform generator 3 to create dynamic sound effects by using its output to influence the frequency value of another generator. This allows you to create complex and dynamic sound effects that are not possible with a single waveform generator."
"What is the advantage of using Synchronisation in sound effects generation?","The advantage of using Synchronisation is that it allows you to create a wide range of interesting sounds, particularly when one of the voices is generating white noise. This can add complexity and depth to your sound effects."
