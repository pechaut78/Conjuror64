"What is a Sprite in the context of home computers?","a small, separate, high resolution screen, which can be overlaid on the main screen anywhere you like."
"What is an advantage of using Sprites?","moving the Sprite around the main screen is fairly simple, it is only necessary to specify the new position for the Sprite screen"
"How many Sprites can the Commodore 64's BASIC control at the same time?","up to eight"
"What happens when Sprites overlay each other?","the Sprite graphics system allows us to detect these collisions between Sprites and also to specify how they will collide, or rather how they will overlay each other"
"What is a use of collision detection facilities of Sprites?","enables some very exciting games to be implemented fairly easily"
"What is required to use a Sprite?","a lot of setting up needs to be done before the Sprite can be used"
"How much memory is required to store a Sprite's data?","a block of at least 63 bytes of memory"
"Why does the VIC chip assume each Sprite's data occupies a 64 byte block of memory?","because the number 64 is much more convenient (64 = 2*)"
"How does the VIC chip find the address of the first byte of Sprite data?","it multiplies the value in the appropriate Sprite Data Pointer by 64"
"What is the range of memory locations which can be used for storing Sprite data?","0 to 16383 decimal"
"What is a limitation of storing Sprite data?","Sprite data can only be stored in the first 16K of memory"
"What are the two available areas that can be used for Sprite data storage?","the Cassette I/O buffer and the BASIC text area"
"What is the Cassette I/O buffer used for?","used by the cassette recorder during LOAD, SAVE, PRINT* and INPUT* operations"
"How many Sprites can be fit in the Cassette I/O buffer?","three"
"What is the BASIC text area used for?","fully used by the BASIC program"
"How can space be released for Sprite data in the BASIC text area?","by moving the start of the BASIC text area up a few bytes"
"What is a characteristic of a Sprite?","a very flexible graphics object with a lot of built in intelligence"
"What is the purpose of Sprites?","to create some very impressive graphics programs using fairly short BASIC routines"
"What is a benefit of using Sprites?","some very exciting games can be implemented fairly easily"
"What is a requirement for using Sprites?","a lot of setting up needs to be done before the Sprite can be used"
"How do Sprites allow for 3D effects?","by overlaying Sprites in a specific order"
"What is a feature of the Sprite graphics system?","collision detection facilities"
"What is a use of Sprites?","to create some very impressive graphics programs"
"What is a characteristic of Sprites on the Commodore 64?","can be controlled by the Commodore 64's BASIC"
"What is a limitation of the VIC chip?","it assumes each Sprite's data occupies a 64 byte block of memory"
"What is the purpose of the Sprite Data Pointer?","to point to the location of a Sprite's data"
"How does the VIC chip use the Sprite Data Pointer?","it multiplies the value in the Sprite Data Pointer by 64 to find the address of the first byte of Sprite data"
"What is a requirement for storing Sprite data?","a block of at least 63 bytes of memory is required"
