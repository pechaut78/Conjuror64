Using Colour on C64

As we mentioned earlier, the colour information for the high 
resolution screen comes from the normal text screen area, 
which is located at address 1024 decimal to 2023 decimal. 
Each text screen location holds the colour information for an 
8 by 8 dots square on the high resolution screen. The byte 
at address 1024 decimal holds the colour information for 
bytes to 7 of the high resolution screen, the byte at address 
1025 decimal holds the colour information for bytes 8 to 15 
of the high resolution screen, and so on. (See Figure 7.2.) 

Within each colour byte the four higli order bits (bits 4 to 
7) contain the colour for any bit on the high resolution 
screen which is set to a 1 and the four low order bits (bits 
to 3) contain the colour for any bit on the h^h resolution 
screen which is reset to 0. 

This means of course, that the colour memory has a much 
lower resolution than the screen memory, so you can only 
colour the screen in blocks of 64 bits. 

Just as with Sprite colours, the high resolution screen can 
operate in two colour modes.
