"Can I use all 64k of RAM on the C64?","The C64 has 64k of RAM, but 16k of ROM overlays 16k of RAM, and another 4k of ROM overlays 4k of RAM, making only 48k of RAM available, and after subtracting 6k for BASIC and the operating system, only 42k of RAM is available for programs, and further limiting it to 38k for writing BASIC programs."
"How does the ROM affect the RAM on the C64?","The ROM overlays a portion of the RAM, with 16k of ROM overlaying 16k of RAM, and another 4k of ROM overlaying 4k of RAM, making the overlaid RAM unavailable for programming, and the remaining RAM is available for use."
"What is the purpose of the 4k of ROM that overlays RAM?","The 4k of ROM that overlays RAM is invisible to the user and the 4k of RAM underneath is available for programs, it's not used by the user, but it's used by the system for storing important system information."
"How can I access the full 64k of RAM on the C64?","It's not possible to access the full 64k of RAM on the C64, because of the ROM overlays, and even if you switch the ROMs in and out of the memory map, it's not easy or advisable from BASIC, so it's not a recommended practice."
"What is the user RAM on the C64?","The user RAM is the 42k of RAM available for programs after subtracting the 6k of RAM used by BASIC and the operating system, and it's the RAM available for writing programs."
"Why can't I use the full 42k of user RAM for writing BASIC programs?","Only 38k of the user RAM is available for writing BASIC programs, the remaining 4k is available for storing machine code routines, such as the BASIC extension program in Chapter 10."
"What is the purpose of the 6k of RAM used by BASIC and the operating system?","The 6k of RAM used by BASIC and the operating system is used for storing important system information, such as pointers and tables, necessary for the system to function properly."
"How does the C64's memory layout affect programming?","The C64's memory layout affects programming by limiting the available RAM for programs, and requiring programmers to work within the constraints of the available RAM, making efficient use of memory a priority."
"What is the relationship between the ROM and RAM on the C64?","The ROM overlays a portion of the RAM, making the overlaid RAM unavailable for programming, and the remaining RAM is available for use, with the ROM providing the necessary system functionality."
"Can I use the full 48k of available RAM for programming?","No, only 42k of the available RAM is available for programming, with 6k being used by BASIC and the operating system, and further limiting it to 38k for writing BASIC programs."
