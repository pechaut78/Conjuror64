INTERRUPT STRUCTURE
Interrupts (including Break or Software Interrupts) are handled
by software polling.
When the processor recognizes an interrupt it vectors through
FFFE, FFFF in ROM to a routine that first inspects the processor
hardware (IRQ line low).
If it was caused by a Break instruction, a Jump Indirect is
executed through locations 02IB, C. If by a hardware interrupt then
a Jump Indirect is taken through locations 0219, A.
These locations being in RAM may be user-modified to point to
extra user code ahead of normal interrupt processing.
Note, however that the IRQ pointer is used by the cassette
routines and should be restored to standard values before the cassette
Save or Load functions are called.
Various sections of the I/O chips can be set up to cause inter
rupts through the IRQ line.
Example: POKE 59470,2 enables a negative edge on the
user port CAL line to cause an interrupt.
However, have your code set up to handle it when it happens!
Also note that each pass through the regular interrupt code
increments the time register.
