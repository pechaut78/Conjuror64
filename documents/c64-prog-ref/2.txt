    The Operating System gives you two modes of BASIC operation:
    1) DIRECT Mode
    2) PROGRAM Mode

    1) When you're using the DIRECT mode, BASIC statements don't have
       line numbers in front of the statement. They are executed whenever
       the <RETURN> key is pressed.
    2) The PROGRAM mode is the one you use for running programs.
       When using the PROGRAM mode, all of your BASIC statements must have
       line numbers in front of them. You can have more than one BASIC
       statement in a line of your program, but the number of statements is
       limited by the fact that you can only put 80 characters on a logical
       screen line. This means that if you are going to go over the 80
       character limit you have to put the entire BASIC statement that
       doesn't fit on a new line with a new line number.
         Always type NEW and hit <RETURN> before starting a new program.
