"What is the purpose of the 02 clock input in the 6526 interface?","The 02 clock input is a TTL compatible input used for internal device operation and as a timing reference for communicating with the system data bus."
"What is the function of the /CS-Chip Select Input in the 6526 interface?","The /CS input controls the activity of the 6526, where a low level on /CS while 02 is high causes the device to respond to signals on the R/W and address (RS) lines, and a high on /CS prevents these lines from controlling the 6526."
"How does the R/W signal control data transfers in the 6526?","The R/W signal, normally supplied by the microprocessor, controls the direction of data transfers of the 6526, where a high on R/W indicates a read (data transfer out of the 6526), and a low indicates a write (data transfer into the 6526)."
"What is the purpose of the RS3-RS0-Address Inputs in the 6526 interface?","The address inputs select the internal registers as described by the Register Map."
"How do the DB7-DB0-Data Bus Inputs/Outputs transfer information in the 6526?","The eight data bus pins transfer information between the 6526 and the system data bus, where these pins are high impedance inputs unless CS is low and R/W and 02 are high to read the device, and during this read, the data bus output buffers are enabled, driving the data from the selected register onto the system data bus."
"What is the function of the IRQ-Interrupt Request Output in the 6526?","The IRQ output is an open drain output normally connected to the processor interrupt input, which is normally off (high impedance) and is activated low as indicated in the functional description."
"What happens when the /RES-Reset Input is low in the 6526?","A low on the RES pin resets all internal registers, where the port pins are set as inputs and port registers to zero (although a read of the ports will return all highs because of passive pullups), the timer control registers are set to zero and the timer latches to all ones, and all other registers are reset to zero."
"How does the 6526 respond to signals on the R/W and address (RS) lines?","The 6526 responds to signals on the R/W and address (RS) lines when /CS is low and 02 is high."
"What is the purpose of the address inputs in the 6526?","The address inputs select the internal registers as described by the Register Map, allowing the 6526 to access and manipulate specific registers."
"How does the 6526 handle data transfer during a read operation?","During a read operation, the data bus output buffers are enabled, driving the data from the selected register onto the system data bus, and the data bus pins are high impedance inputs unless CS is low and R/W and 02 are high to read the device."
