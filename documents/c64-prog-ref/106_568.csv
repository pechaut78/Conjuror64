"what is the main difference between indexed indirect and indirect indexed addressing modes?","The main difference between indexed indirect and indirect indexed addressing modes is that in indexed indirect, the zero page address of the pointer is indexed, whereas in indirect indexed, the actual base address is indexed."
"in what scenario would you use indexed indirect addressing mode?","You would use indexed indirect addressing mode when you have a table of indirect pointers located in zero page memory and you want to specify which indirect pointer to use with the X register."
"what is the role of the X register in indexed indirect addressing mode?","The X register is used as an index to specify which indirect pointer to use in the zero page memory, allowing you to dynamically change the base address of the indirect pointer."
"how does the indexed indirect addressing mode calculate the actual address?","The actual address is calculated by taking the contents of the zero page address plus the value of the X register, where the low order byte of the address is taken from the contents of the calculated address and the high order byte is taken from the next byte."
"what is an example of a scenario where indexed indirect addressing mode would be useful?","An example of a scenario where indexed indirect addressing mode would be useful is when you have a table of function pointers in zero page memory and you want to dynamically call a function based on a variable index."
"what is the equivalent code for the example given in the text?","The equivalent code for the example given in the text is: LDA #$00, STA $06, LDA #$16, STA $07, LDX #$05, LDA ($02,X)"
"how does the analogy of delivering a letter to a post office relate to indexed indirect addressing mode?","The analogy of delivering a letter to a post office relates to indexed indirect addressing mode in that the letter (data) is delivered to a post office (indirect address) which then forwards it to the actual address (indirect pointer) specified by the index (X register)."
"in what way is the actual base address different from the indirect address in indexed indirect addressing mode?","The actual base address is the address of the indirect pointer, whereas the indirect address is the address contained in the indirect pointer, which is the actual address accessed."
"what is the significance of the X register being set to $00 in the example?","The significance of the X register being set to $00 in the example is that it means the index is not added to the base address, resulting in the actual address being the same as the base address."
"how does the indexed indirect addressing mode handle the high and low order bytes of the address?","The indexed indirect addressing mode handles the high and low order bytes of the address by taking the low order byte from the contents of the calculated address and the high order byte from the next byte."
