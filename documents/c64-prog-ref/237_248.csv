"What is the maximum number of characters that can be held in the output buffer before a full buffer hold-off occurs?","The output buffer can hold 255 characters before a full buffer hold-off occurs, at which point the system will wait in the CHROUT routine until transmission is allowed or the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys are used to recover the system through a WARM START."
"What is the BASIC syntax for sending data to an RS-232 channel?","The BASIC syntax for sending data to an RS-232 channel is PRINT#lfn,<variable list>, where lfn is the logical file number of the channel."
"What is the purpose of the CHKOUT KERNAL entry?","The CHKOUT KERNAL entry ($FFC9) handles the x-line handshake, which follows the EIA standard (August 1979) for RS-232-C interfaces, and implements the RTS, CTS, and DCD lines as defined by the Commodore 64 as the Data Terminal Device."
"What is the purpose of the CHROUT KERNAL entry?","The CHROUT KERNAL entry ($FFD2) is responsible for transmitting data to the RS-232 channel, and will wait until transmission is allowed or the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys are used to recover the system through a WARM START."
"Why is it important to implement a hold-off or internal buffering when sending data to an RS-232 printer?","It is important to implement a hold-off or internal buffering when sending data to an RS-232 printer because there is no carriage-return delay built into the output channel, which means that a normal RS-232 printer cannot correctly print without some form of hold-off or internal buffering."
"How can the Commodore 64 buffer be made to hold-off more output until transmission is allowed by the RS-232 device?","The Commodore 64 buffer can be made to hold-off more output until transmission is allowed by the RS-232 device by implementing a CTS (x-line) handshake, which will cause the buffer to fill and then hold-off more output until transmission is allowed."
"What is x-line handshaking, and how is it used in RS-232 communication?","X-line handshaking is a handshake routine that uses multiple lines for receiving and transmitting data, and is used in RS-232 communication to control the flow of data between devices."
"What is the EIA standard for RS-232-C interfaces, and how is it related to the Commodore 64?","The EIA standard for RS-232-C interfaces is a standard for serial communication, and the Commodore 64 implements this standard through the CHKOUT KERNAL entry, which handles the x-line handshake and implements the RTS, CTS, and DCD lines as defined by the Commodore 64 as the Data Terminal Device."
"What happens if the output buffer becomes full and transmission is not allowed by the RS-232 device?","If the output buffer becomes full and transmission is not allowed by the RS-232 device, the system will wait in the CHROUT routine until transmission is allowed or the <RUN/STOP> and <RESTORE> keys are used to recover the system through a WARM START."
"How can a program implement a hold-off to prevent the output buffer from overflowing when sending data to an RS-232 channel?","A program can implement a hold-off to prevent the output buffer from overflowing when sending data to an RS-232 channel by using a delay or wait loop to pause transmission until the buffer is empty or transmission is allowed by the RS-232 device."
