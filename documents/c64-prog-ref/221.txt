    Computers have three basic abilities: they can calculate, make deci-
  sions, and communicate. Calculation is probably the easiest to program.
  Most of the rules of mathematics are familiar to us. Decision making is
  not too difficult, since the rules of logic are relatively few, even if
  you don't know them too well yet.
    Communication is the most complex, because it involves the least
  exacting set of rules. This is not an oversight in the design of
  computers. The rules allow enough flexibility to communicate virtually
  anything, and in many possible ways. The only real rule is this: whatever
  sends information must present the information so that it can be
  understood by the receiver.
