  THE REGISTERS INSIDE THE 6510 MICROPROCESSOR

  THE ACCUMULATOR

    This is THE most important register in the microprocessor. Various ma-
  chine language instructions allow you to copy the contents of a memory
  location into the accumulator, copy the contents of the accumulator into
  a memory location, modify the contents of the accumulator or some other
  register directly, without affecting any memory. And the accumulator is
  the only register that has instructions for performing math.
