CS (Pin 8)

    This TTL-Level input is a low active chip select which controls data
  transfers between SID and the microprocessor. CS must be low for any
  transfer. A Read from the selected SID register can only occur if CS is
  low, 02 is high and R/W is high. A Write to the selected SID register can
  only occur if CS is low, (02 is high and R/W is low. This pin is normally
  connected to address decoding circuitry, allowing SID to reside in the
  memory map of a system.
