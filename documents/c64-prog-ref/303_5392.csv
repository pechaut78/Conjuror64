question,answer
"what is the function of the dynamic ram refresh controller in the 6566/6567 devices?","The dynamic ram refresh controller is built into the 6566/6567 devices and is responsible for refreshing the dynamic RAM. It refreshes five 8-bit row addresses every raster line, guaranteeing a maximum delay of 2.02 ms between the refresh of any single row address in a 128 refresh scheme."
"what is the maximum delay between the refresh of any single row address in a 256 address refresh scheme?","The maximum delay between the refresh of any single row address in a 256 address refresh scheme is 3.66 ms."
"when does the refresh of dynamic ram occur in the system clock?","The refresh of dynamic ram occurs during Phase 1 of the system clock, making it transparent to the system."
"what signals are generated by the 6567 for every Phase 2 and video data access?","The 6567 generates both /RAS and /CAS signals for every Phase 2 and video data access, including refresh, eliminating the need for external clock generation."
"in what phase of the system clock does the refresh of dynamic ram occur?","The refresh of dynamic ram occurs during Phase 1 of the system clock."
"what is the purpose of the /RAS and /CAS signals generated by the 6567?","The /RAS and /CAS signals generated by the 6567 are connected directly to the dynamic rams and are used to control the refresh of the dynamic RAM."
"how often are the five 8-bit row addresses refreshed in the dynamic ram refresh controller?","The five 8-bit row addresses are refreshed every raster line in the dynamic ram refresh controller."
"what is the benefit of the dynamic ram refresh controller being built into the 6566/6567 devices?","The benefit of the dynamic ram refresh controller being built into the 6566/6567 devices is that it eliminates the need for external clock generation, making the system more efficient."
"is the refresh of dynamic ram transparent to the system?","Yes, the refresh of dynamic ram is totally transparent to the system because it occurs during Phase 1 of the system clock."
"what is the role of the 6567 in the dynamic ram refresh process?","The 6567 generates the necessary signals (/RAS and /CAS) to control the refresh of the dynamic RAM, making it an essential component of the dynamic ram refresh process."
