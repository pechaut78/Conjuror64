question,answer
"What is the purpose of the ENV 3 register?","The ENV 3 register allows the microprocessor to read the output of the Voice 3 Envelope Generator, which can be used to create harmonic envelopes, WAH-WAH, and similar effects by adding the output to the Filter Frequency."
"What is required for the ENV 3 register to produce any output?","The Voice 3 Envelope Generator must be Gated in order to produce any output from the ENV 3 register."
"How does the ENV 3 register differ from the OSC 3 register?","The OSC 3 register always reflects the changing output of the oscillator and is not affected in any way by the Envelope Generator, whereas the ENV 3 register is affected by the Envelope Generator and requires it to be Gated."
"What type of effects can be created by adding the output of the ENV 3 register to the frequency control registers of an oscillator?","'Phaser' sounds can be created by adding the output of the ENV 3 register to the frequency control registers of an oscillator."
"What is the relationship between the ENV 3 register and the Voice 3 Envelope Generator?","The ENV 3 register allows the microprocessor to read the output of the Voice 3 Envelope Generator, which can be used to create various effects."
"How does the ENV 3 register interact with the Filter Frequency?","The output of the ENV 3 register can be added to the Filter Frequency to produce harmonic envelopes, WAH-WAH, and similar effects."
"What is the role of the Envelope Generator in relation to the ENV 3 register?","The Envelope Generator must be Gated in order to produce any output from the ENV 3 register, and the output of the ENV 3 register is dependent on the Envelope Generator."
"What is the difference in behavior between the ENV 3 register and the OSC 3 register when the Envelope Generator is Gated?","The ENV 3 register will produce output when the Envelope Generator is Gated, whereas the OSC 3 register is not affected by the Envelope Generator and will always reflect the changing output of the oscillator."
"How can the ENV 3 register be used to create WAH-WAH effects?","The output of the ENV 3 register can be added to the Filter Frequency to produce WAH-WAH effects."
"What is the purpose of gating the Voice 3 Envelope Generator in relation to the ENV 3 register?","Gating the Voice 3 Envelope Generator allows the ENV 3 register to produce output, which can be used to create various effects."
