question,answer
"what is the purpose of the light pen input","The light pen input is used to latch the current screen position into a pair of registers (LPX,LPY) on a low-going edge, allowing the X and Y positions to be captured and stored."
"what is stored in register 19 ($13)","The 8 most significant bits (MSB) of the X position at the time of transition are stored in register 19 ($13), providing a resolution of 2 horizontal dots."
"what is the resolution of the X position","The X position is defined by a 512-state counter, providing a resolution of 9 bits, which translates to 2 horizontal dots."
"what is stored in register 20 ($14)","The Y position is latched to register 20 ($14), with 8 bits providing single raster resolution within the visible display."
"why must you take several samples before turning the light pen to the screen","You must take several samples (3 or more) before turning the light pen to the screen to ensure accurate readings, depending upon the characteristics of your light pen, as the light pen latch may be triggered only once per frame."
"what happens if the light pen latch is triggered multiple times within the same frame","Subsequent triggers within the same frame will have no effect, as the light pen latch may be triggered only once per frame."
"what is the effect of the low-going edge on the light pen input","The low-going edge of the light pen input triggers the latching of the current screen position into the LPX and LPY registers."
"how does the light pen input capture the screen position","The light pen input captures the screen position by latching the current X and Y positions into the LPX and LPY registers on a low-going edge."
"what is the significance of the 9-bit counter in the X position","The 9-bit counter in the X position provides a resolution of 2 horizontal dots, allowing for precise capture of the X coordinate."
"what is the purpose of averaging multiple samples of the light pen input","Averaging multiple samples of the light pen input helps to ensure accurate readings, as the light pen latch may be triggered only once per frame and subsequent triggers within the same frame will have no effect."
