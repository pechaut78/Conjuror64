"what is the instruction to call a subroutine in machine language?","The instruction to call a subroutine in machine language is JSR (Jump to Sub-Routine), followed by the specified absolute address."
"what is the address of the machine language subroutine that prints a character to the screen?","The address of the machine language subroutine that prints a character to the screen is $FFD2, and it requires the CBM ASCII code of the character to be in the accumulator before calling the subroutine."
"how do you load the CBM ASCII code of a character into the accumulator?","You load the CBM ASCII code of a character into the accumulator using the LDA instruction, for example, LDA #$48 loads the CBM ASCII code of 'H' into the accumulator."
"what is the purpose of the JSR $FFD2 instruction in the example program?","The purpose of the JSR $FFD2 instruction in the example program is to print the character in the accumulator to the screen, in this case, the characters 'H', 'I', and a carriage return."
"what is the purpose of the BRK instruction at the end of the example program?","The purpose of the BRK instruction at the end of the example program is to return to 64MON, which is a monitor program that allows you to interact with the computer."
"what is the purpose of the .G 1400 directive in the example program?","The purpose of the .G 1400 directive in the example program is to specify the starting address of the program, in this case, $1400, which is where the program will begin execution."
"how do you print a string of characters to the screen using the subroutine at $FFD2?","You print a string of characters to the screen using the subroutine at $FFD2 by loading the CBM ASCII code of each character into the accumulator and then calling the subroutine, for example, to print 'Hi', you would load the codes for 'H' and 'I' and call the subroutine twice."
"what is the advantage of using subroutines in machine language programming?","The advantage of using subroutines in machine language programming is that it allows you to reuse code and organize your program in a modular fashion, making it easier to write and maintain."
"how do you specify the address of a subroutine in machine language?","You specify the address of a subroutine in machine language by using the absolute address of the subroutine, for example, JSR $FFD2 specifies the address of the subroutine that prints a character to the screen."
"what is the relationship between the accumulator and the subroutine at $FFD2?","The accumulator must contain the CBM ASCII code of the character to be printed before calling the subroutine at $FFD2, which will then print the character to the screen."
