question,answer
"Handshaking on data transfers can be accomplished using which pins?","the /PC output pin and the FLAG input pin"
"What is the function of the /PC output pin?","to indicate 'data ready' at PORT B or 'data accepted' from PORT B"
"How can handshaking on 16-bit data transfers be accomplished?","by always reading or writing PORT A first"
"What is the function of the /FLAG input pin?","a negative edge sensitive input which can be used for receiving the /PC output from another 6526, or as a general purpose interrupt input"
"What happens when there is a negative transition of /FLAG?","the /FLAG interrupt bit is set"
"What is an interval timer composed of?","a 16-bit read-only Timer Counter and a 16-bit write-only Timer Latch"
"What is the function of the Timer Latch?","to latch in the data written to the timer"
"What is the function of the Timer Counter?","to hold the present contents of the timer"
"How can the timers be used?","independently or linked for extended operations"
"What can the timers generate?","long time delays, variable width pulses, pulse trains and variable frequency waveforms"
"What is the function of the CNT input?","to count external pulses or measure frequency, pulse width and delay times of external signals"
"What is the function of the control register?","to provide independent control of the timer functions"
"What is the function of the Start/Stop control bit?","to allow the timer to be started or stopped by the micro-processor at any time"
"What is the function of the PB On/Off control bit?","to allow the timer output to appear on a PORT B output line"
"What is the function of the Toggle/Pulse control bit?","to select the output applied to PORT B"
"What is the function of the One-Shot/Continuous control bit?","to select either timer mode"
"What is the function of the Force Load control bit?","to allow the timer latch to be loaded into the timer counter at any time"
"What is the function of the Input Mode control bits?","to select the clock used to decrement the timer"
