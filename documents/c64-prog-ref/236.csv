question,answer
"RS232: what is the maximum number of characters that the Commodore 64 receiver buffer can hold?","The Commodore 64 receiver buffer will hold up to 255 characters before the buffer overflows."
"RS232: what happens if the buffer overflows?","If an overflow occurs, then all characters received during a full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost."
"RS232: what is the recommended way to receive RS-232 data at high speeds?","You will have to use machine language routines to handle this type of data burst."
"RS232: what is the difference between GET# and INPUT#?","GET# is recommended, while INPUT# is not recommended because it can cause the system to hang in a waiting condition."
"RS232: what happens if a GET# does not find any data in the buffer?","The character "" (a null) is returned."
"RS232: what is the purpose of the routine CHKIN?","The routine CHKIN handles the x-line handshake which follows the EIA standard for RS-232-C interfaces."
"RS232: what is the standard for RS-232-C interfaces?","The standard is defined as the Data Terminal device."
"RS232: what happens if the Clear To Send (CTS) or Data Set Ready (DSR) line(s) disappear during character INPUT#?","The system will hang in a RESTORE-only state."
"RS232: what is the recommended way to handle data bursts?","You will have to use machine language routines to handle this type of data burst."
"RS232: what is the maximum word length for RS-232-C interfaces?","The maximum word length is 8 bits."
"RS232: what happens if the word length is less than 8 bits?","All unused bit(s) will be assigned a value of zero."
"RS232: what is the purpose of the routine GETIN?","The routine GETIN is used to receive data from an RS-232 channel."
"RS232: what is the purpose of the routine CHRIN?","The routine CHRIN is used to receive data from an RS-232 channel."
"RS232: what is the recommended way to receive data from an RS-232 channel?","You should use the GET# routine."
"RS232: what happens if the buffer is not kept clear?","The buffer will overflow and all characters received during a full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost."
