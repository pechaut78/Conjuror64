question,answer
"what is the central component of a microcomputer","The central component of a microcomputer is the central microprocessor, which is a very special microchip that serves as the 'brain' of the computer."
"what is machine language","Machine language is the native language of the machine, and it is the only programming language that the Commodore 64 understands, comprising a set of instructions that the microprocessor can execute directly."
"what is the relationship between machine language and CBM BASIC","Machine language is the native language of the Commodore 64, whereas CBM BASIC is a higher-level language that is translated into machine language by the operating system, allowing the Commodore 64 to understand CBM BASIC instructions like PRINT and GOTO."
"what is the operating system of the Commodore 64","The operating system of the Commodore 64 is a machine language program stored in a special type of memory that cannot be changed and does not disappear when the computer is turned off, and it is automatically 'run' when the Commodore 64 is turned on."
"how does the Commodore 64 understand CBM BASIC instructions","The Commodore 64 understands CBM BASIC instructions because the operating system translates them into machine language instructions that the microprocessor can execute directly."
"what is the significance of the operating system in the Commodore 64","The operating system plays a crucial role in the Commodore 64, as it enables the computer to understand CBM BASIC instructions and provides a layer of abstraction between the user and the machine language, making it possible to write programs in a higher-level language."
"what happens when the Commodore 64 is turned on","When the Commodore 64 is turned on, its operating system is automatically 'run', which enables the computer to understand CBM BASIC instructions and perform tasks according to the user's program."
"what is the difference between machine language and CBM BASIC","Machine language is the native language of the Commodore 64, consisting of instructions that the microprocessor can execute directly, whereas CBM BASIC is a higher-level language that requires translation into machine language by the operating system."
"what is the role of the microprocessor in the Commodore 64","The microprocessor is the 'brain' of the Commodore 64, executing machine language instructions and performing calculations and operations according to the user's program."
"what is the purpose of the operating system in the Commodore 64","The purpose of the operating system in the Commodore 64 is to provide a layer of abstraction between the user and the machine language, enabling the computer to understand CBM BASIC instructions and perform tasks according to the user's program."
