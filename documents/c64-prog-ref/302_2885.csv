"what is the purpose of the interrupt register in the C64?","The interrupt register is used to show the status of the four sources of interrupt, which are set to '1' when an interrupt source has generated an interrupt request, allowing the system to handle and prioritize interrupts efficiently."
"what are the four sources of interrupt in the C64?","The four sources of interrupt in the C64 are: IRST (Raster count interrupt), IMDC (Sprite-DATA collision interrupt), IMMC (Sprite-Sprite collision interrupt), and ILP (Light Pen interrupt)."
"how is the interrupt latch in the interrupt register set?","The interrupt latch in the interrupt register is set to '1' when an interrupt source has generated an interrupt request, and can only be cleared by writing a '1' to the desired latch in the interrupt register."
"what is the purpose of the interrupt enable bit in register 26 ($1A)?","The interrupt enable bit in register 26 ($1A) must be set to '1' to enable an interrupt request to set the /IRQ output to '0', allowing the interrupt to be handled by the system."
"what is the effect of writing a '1' to the desired latch in the interrupt register?","Writing a '1' to the desired latch in the interrupt register clears the latch, allowing the system to selectively handle video interrupts without requiring software to 'remember' active interrupts."
"what is the significance of the /IRQ output in the interrupt system?","The /IRQ output is set to '0' when an interrupt request is enabled and the corresponding interrupt latch is set, indicating to the system that an interrupt needs to be handled."
"how does the system handle multiple interrupt sources?","The system handles multiple interrupt sources by using the interrupt register to prioritize and handle interrupts efficiently, allowing the system to selectively handle video interrupts without requiring software to 'remember' active interrupts."
"what is the purpose of the raster count interrupt (IRST)?","The raster count interrupt (IRST) is set when the raster count equals the stored raster count, allowing the system to synchronize with the video display."
"what is the purpose of the sprite-DATA collision interrupt (IMDC)?","The sprite-DATA collision interrupt (IMDC) is set by the sprite-DATA collision register (first collision only), allowing the system to detect and handle sprite collisions."
"what is the purpose of the light pen interrupt (ILP)?","The light pen interrupt (ILP) is set by the negative transition of the LP input (once per frame), allowing the system to detect and handle light pen events."
