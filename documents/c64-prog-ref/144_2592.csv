question,answer
"What is the opcode for loading the Y register with an immediate value?","The opcode for loading the Y register with an immediate value is A0, and it requires 2 bytes and 2 cycles to execute."
"What is the difference in cycles required for loading the Y register with a zero page address versus an absolute address?","The difference in cycles required for loading the Y register with a zero page address versus an absolute address is 1 cycle, with zero page addressing taking 3 cycles and absolute addressing taking 4 cycles."
"How does the LDY instruction with the X register as an index affect the number of cycles required?","When the X register is used as an index with the LDY instruction, the number of cycles required increases by 1, from 3 to 4 cycles, and an additional cycle is required if a page boundary is crossed."
"What is the addressing mode used when the LDY instruction is used with an immediate value?","The addressing mode used when the LDY instruction is used with an immediate value is Immediate addressing, which requires 2 bytes and 2 cycles to execute."
"What is the opcode for loading the Y register with a zero page address?","The opcode for loading the Y register with a zero page address is A4, and it requires 2 bytes and 3 cycles to execute."
"How does the LDY instruction with a zero page address differ from the LDY instruction with an absolute address?","The LDY instruction with a zero page address differs from the LDY instruction with an absolute address in that it uses a shorter address and requires fewer cycles, with the zero page address taking 3 cycles and the absolute address taking 4 cycles."
"What is the effect of crossing a page boundary when using the LDY instruction with an absolute address and the X register as an index?","When using the LDY instruction with an absolute address and the X register as an index, crossing a page boundary adds an additional cycle to the execution time, increasing the total number of cycles from 4 to 5."
"What is the purpose of the LDY instruction?","The purpose of the LDY instruction is to load the Y register with a value from memory, which can be used for various purposes such as indexing, counting, and storing data."
"In what way does the LDY instruction with the X register as an index differ from the LDY instruction without the X register?","The LDY instruction with the X register as an index differs from the LDY instruction without the X register in that it allows for more flexibility in addressing memory locations, as the X register can be used to offset the address."
"What is the opcode for loading the Y register with an absolute address?","The opcode for loading the Y register with an absolute address is AC, and it requires 3 bytes and 4 cycles to execute."
