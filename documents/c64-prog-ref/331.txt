 A0-A4 (Pins 9-13)

    These TTL-Level inputs are used to select one of the 29 SID registers.
  Although enough addresses are provided to select 1 of 32 registers, the
  remaining three register locations are not used. A Write to any of these
  three locations is ignored and a Read returns invalid data. These pins
  are normally connected to the corresponding address lines of the micro-
  processor so that SID may be addressed in the same manner as memory.
