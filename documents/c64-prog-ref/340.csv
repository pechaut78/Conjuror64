question,answer
"what is the four-part envelope generator used in electronic music?","The four-part ADSR (ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, RELEASE) envelope generator has been proven in electronic music to provide the optimum trade-off between flexibility and ease of amplitude control."
"what is the violin an example of?","The violin is a good example of a sustained instrument."
"how does the violinist control the volume of the violin?","The violinist controls the volume by bowing the instrument."
"what happens to the volume of the violin after it reaches a peak?","The volume drops to an intermediate level."
"can the tone of the violin be held at the intermediate SUSTAIN level?","Yes, the tone can be held at the intermediate SUSTAIN level for as long as desired."
"what happens to the tone of the violin when GATE is cleared?","The tone will not begin to die away until GATE is cleared."
"can the basic envelope of the violin be used for other instruments?","Yes, with minor alterations, this basic envelope can be used for brass and woodwinds as well as strings."
"what is the characteristic of the percussion envelope?","The percussion envelope is characterized by a nearly instantaneous attack, immediately followed by a decay to zero volume."
"can percussion instruments be sustained at a constant amplitude?","No, percussion instruments cannot be sustained at a constant amplitude."
"what happens to the sound of a drum after it is struck?","The sound reaches full volume and decays rapidly regardless of how it was struck."
"what happens to the tone of percussion instruments after the peak is reached?","The tone immediately begins to decay to zero amplitude after the peak is reached, regardless of when GATE is cleared."
"what is the amplitude envelope of pianos and harpsichords like?","The amplitude envelope of pianos and harpsichords is somewhat more complicated, but can be generated quite easily with the ADSR."
"what happens to the amplitude of pianos and harpsichords when a key is first struck?","The amplitude reaches full volume when a key is first struck."
"what happens to the amplitude of pianos and harpsichords when a key remains depressed?","The amplitude immediately begins to die away slowly as long as the key remains depressed."
"what happens to the amplitude of pianos and harpsichords when a key is released?","If the key is released before the sound has fully died away, the amplitude will immediately drop to zero."
"what is the amplitude envelope of the organ like?","When a key is pressed, the tone immediately reaches full volume and remains there."
"what happens to the amplitude of the organ when a key is released?","When the key is released, the tone drops immediately to zero volume."
"what is the real power of SID?","The real power of SID lies in the ability to create original sounds rather than simulations of acoustic instruments."
"what is an example of an original sound that can be created with SID?","A good example would be the 'backwards' envelope, which is characterized by a slow attack and rapid decay which sounds very much like an instrument that has been recorded on tape then played backwards."
"what can be created by applying the amplitude envelope of one instrument to the harmonic structure of another?","Many unique sounds can be created by applying the amplitude envelope of one instrument to the harmonic structure of another."
"what is necessary to achieve the desired sound?","Experimentation with various envelope rates and harmonic contents will be necessary in order to achieve the desired sound."
