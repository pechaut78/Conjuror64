question,answer
"what is the purpose of the OSC 3/RANDOM register?","The OSC 3/RANDOM register allows the microprocessor to read the upper 8 output bits of Oscillator 3, which can be used as a random number generator for games, a modulation generator, and for various timing and sequencing applications."
"what happens when the Sawtooth waveform of Oscillator 3 is selected?","When the Sawtooth waveform of Oscillator 3 is selected, the OSC 3/RANDOM register will present a series of numbers incrementing from 0 to 255 ($FF) at a rate determined by the frequency of Oscillator 3."
"what is the effect of selecting the Triangle waveform on the OSC 3/RANDOM register?","When the Triangle waveform is selected, the output of the OSC 3/RANDOM register will increment from 0 up to 255, then decrement down to 0."
"how can the OSC 3/RANDOM register be used to create dynamic effects?","The numbers generated by the OSC 3/RANDOM register can be added, via software, to the Oscillator or Filter Frequency registers or the Pulse Width registers in real-time, allowing for the creation of many dynamic effects such as siren-like sounds, synthesizer 'Sample and Hold' effects, and vibrato."
"what is the purpose of setting Oscillator 3 to a frequency around 7 Hz?","Setting Oscillator 3 to a frequency around 7 Hz allows for the creation of vibrato effects by adding the OSC 3 Triangle output (with proper scaling) to the Frequency control of another oscillator."
"what is the effect of adding the OSC 3 Sawtooth output to the frequency control of another oscillator?","Adding the OSC 3 Sawtooth output to the frequency control of another oscillator can create siren-like sounds."
"what is the effect of adding the OSC 3 Noise output to the Filter Frequency control registers?","Adding the OSC 3 Noise output to the Filter Frequency control registers can produce synthesizer 'Sample and Hold' effects."
"why should the audio output of Voice 3 be eliminated when using Oscillator 3 for modulation?","The audio output of Voice 3 should be eliminated (3 OFF = 1) when using Oscillator 3 for modulation to prevent unwanted audio output."
"what is the range of effects that can be generated by altering the frequency of Oscillator 3 and scaling the OSC 3 output?","An unlimited range of effects can be generated by altering the frequency of Oscillator 3 and scaling the OSC 3 output."
"what is the chief function of the OSC 3/RANDOM register?","The chief function of the OSC 3/RANDOM register is probably that of a modulation generator, allowing for the creation of various dynamic effects."
