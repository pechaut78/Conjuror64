"what is the resolution of a multi-color sprite?","The resolution of the sprite becomes 12 horizontal dots by 21 vertical dots, with each dot in the sprite becoming twice as wide, allowing for 4 colors to be displayed"
"what happens when a bit is set to 0 in a sprite definition?","Each bit set to 0 is transparent and will display whatever data is behind it"
"how do multi-color sprites trade off resolution for color?","Horizontal resolution is traded for extra color resolution, allowing for 4 colors to be displayed in the sprite"

"how are sprites defined?","Sprites are defined like programmable characters, but require more bytes due to their larger size"
"what happens when a bit is set to 1 in a sprite definition?","Each bit set to 1 is displayed in that sprite's foreground color"
"can you explain how a sprite definition block works?","A sprite definition block works by setting each bit to 0 for transparency or 1 for the foreground color, allowing for the creation of a sprite"
"what is the advantage of using multi-color sprites?","The advantage of using multi-color sprites is that they can display more colors, making them useful for creating detailed and colorful graphics"
