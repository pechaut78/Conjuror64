question,answer
"what is the source of color information in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, the color information is derived only from the data stored in the video matrix, and the color nybble is disregarded."
"How are the 8 bits divided in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, the 8 bits are divided into two 4-bit nybbles which allow two colors to be independently selected in each 8*8 dot block."
"What determines the output color when a bit in the display memory is a '0'?","When a bit in the display memory is a '0', the color of the output dot is set by the least significant (lower) nybble (LSN)."
"What determines the output color when a bit in the display memory is a '1'?","When a bit in the display memory is a '1', the output color is determined by the most significant nybble (MSN)."
"How many colors can be selected in each 8*8 dot block in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, two colors can be independently selected in each 8*8 dot block."
"What is the role of the video matrix pointer in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, the video matrix pointer is used to determine the display color, with the lower nybble of the video matrix pointer selecting the color when a bit in the display memory is a '0', and the upper nybble selecting the color when a bit in the display memory is a '1'."
"What is the significance of the least significant nybble (LSN) in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, the least significant nybble (LSN) determines the output color when a bit in the display memory is a '0'."
"What is the significance of the most significant nybble (MSN) in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, the most significant nybble (MSN) determines the output color when a bit in the display memory is a '1'."
"How does the bit value in the display memory affect the output color in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, the bit value in the display memory affects the output color, with a '0' selecting the color determined by the LSN and a '1' selecting the color determined by the MSN."
"What is the relationship between the display memory and the video matrix in standard bit map mode?","In standard bit map mode, the display memory and the video matrix are used together to determine the output color, with the display memory providing the bit values and the video matrix providing the color information."
