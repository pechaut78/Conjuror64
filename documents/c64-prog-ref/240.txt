 ZERO-PAGE MEMORY LOCATIONS AND USAGE FOR
  RS-232 SYSTEM INTERFACE

    $00A7-INBIT-Receiver input bit temp storage.
    $00A8-BITCI-Receiver bit count in.
    $00A9-RINONE-Receiver flag Start bit check.
    $00AA-RIDATA-Receiver byte buffer/assembly location.
    $00AB-RIPRTY-Receiver parity bit storage.
    $00B4-BITTS-Transmitter bit count out.
    $00B5-NXTBIT-Transmitter next bit to be sent.
    $00B6-RODATA-Transmitter byte buffer/disassembly location.


    All the above zero-page locations are used locally and are only given
  as a guide to understand the associated routines. These cannot be used
  directly by the BASIC or KERNAL level programmer to do RS-232 type
  things. The system RS-232 routines must be used.
