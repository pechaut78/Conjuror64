question,answer
"what is the function of FC LO and FC HI registers in the C64's programmable Filter?","Together, FC LO and FC HI registers form an 11-bit number that linearly controls the Cutoff (or Center) Frequency of the programmable Filter, with an approximate range of 30 Hz to 12 KHz."
"what is the purpose of the RES/FILT register in the C64's programmable Filter?","The RES/FILT register controls the resonance of the filter, with bits 4-7 (RES0-RES3) determining the resonance level, and bits 0-3 determining which signals will be routed through the Filter, including Voice 1, Voice 2, Voice 3, and External audio input."
"what is the range of resonance settings in the C64's programmable Filter?","The resonance settings range from no resonance (0) to maximum resonance (15 or $F), with 16 linearly spaced settings."
"how does the FILT 1 bit in the RES/FILT register affect Voice 1 in the C64's programmable Filter?","When the FILT 1 bit is set to 0, Voice 1 appears directly at the audio output and the Filter has no effect on it, but when set to 1, Voice 1 is processed through the Filter and its harmonic content is altered according to the selected Filter parameters."
"what is the function of the FILTEX bit in the RES/FILT register in the C64's programmable Filter?","The FILTEX bit determines whether the External audio input (pin 26) is processed through the Filter, with a 0 setting bypassing the Filter and a 1 setting routing the External audio input through the Filter."
"what is the total number of bits used to control the Cutoff Frequency in the C64's programmable Filter?","The Cutoff Frequency is controlled by an 11-bit number formed by FC LO and FC HI registers."
"what is the highest possible Cutoff Frequency in the C64's programmable Filter?","The highest possible Cutoff Frequency is approximately 12 KHz."
"what happens to the harmonic content of Voice 1 when the FILT 1 bit is set to 1 in the RES/FILT register?","The harmonic content of Voice 1 is altered according to the selected Filter parameters when the FILT 1 bit is set to 1."
"what is the purpose of bits 0-3 in the RES/FILT register in the C64's programmable Filter?","Bits 0-3 in the RES/FILT register determine which signals will be routed through the Filter, including Voice 1, Voice 2, Voice 3, and External audio input."
"what is the lowest possible Cutoff Frequency in the C64's programmable Filter?","The lowest possible Cutoff Frequency is approximately 30 Hz."
