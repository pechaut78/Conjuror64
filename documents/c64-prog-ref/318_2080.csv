question,answer
"what is the function of the GATE bit in the control register","The GATE bit controls the Envelope Generator for Voice 1, when set to a one, the Envelope Generator is Gated (triggered) and the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle is initiated, and when reset to a zero, the RELEASE cycle begins."
"what happens when the SYNC bit is set to a one","The SYNC bit synchronizes the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 3, producing 'Hard Sync' effects."
"what is the function of the RING MOD bit","The RING MOD bit replaces the Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1 with a 'Ring Modulated' combination of Oscillators 1 and 3, producing a wide range of non-harmonic overtone structures for creating bell or gong sounds and for special effects."
"what is the function of the TEST bit","The TEST bit resets and locks Oscillator 1 at zero until the TEST bit is cleared, the Noise waveform output of Oscillator 1 is also reset and the Pulse waveform output is held at a DC level."
"what waveform is selected when bit 4 is set to a one","The Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1 is selected, which is low in harmonics and has a mellow, flute-like quality."
"what waveform is selected when bit 5 is set to a one","The Sawtooth waveform output of Oscillator 1 is selected, which is rich in even and odd harmonics and has a bright, brassy quality."
"what waveform is selected when bit 6 is set to a one","The Pulse waveform output of Oscillator 1 is selected, the harmonic content of which can be adjusted by the Pulse Width registers, producing tone qualities ranging from a bright, hollow square wave to a nasal, reedy pulse."
"what waveform is selected when bit 7 is set to a one","The Noise output waveform of Oscillator 1 is selected, which is a random signal that changes at the frequency of Oscillator 1 and can be varied from a low rumbling to hissing white noise via the Oscillator 1 Frequency registers."
"what is the purpose of the Envelope Generator","The Envelope Generator controls the amplitude of Oscillator 1 appearing at the audio output, and the GATE bit must be set (along with suitable envelope parameters) for the selected output of Oscillator 1 to be audible."
"what happens when more than one output waveform is selected simultaneously","The result will be a logical ANDing of the waveforms, although this technique can be used to generate additional waveforms beyond the four listed above, it must be used with care."
"what happens if any other waveform is selected while Noise is on","The Noise output can 'lock up', and will remain silent until reset by the TEST bit or by bringing RES (pin 5) low."
"what is the condition for sync to occur","Oscillator 3 must be set to some frequency other than zero but preferably lower than the frequency of Oscillator 1."
"what is the condition for ring modulation to be audible","The Triangle waveform of Oscillator 1 must be selected and Oscillator 3 must be set to some frequency other than zero."
"what is the effect of varying the frequency of Oscillator 1 with respect to Oscillator 3","A wide range of complex harmonic structures from Voice 1 at the frequency of Oscillator 3 is produced."
"what is the effect of varying the frequency of Oscillator 1 with respect to Oscillator 3 in ring modulation","A wide range of non-harmonic overtone structures for creating bell or gong sounds and for special effects is produced."
"what is the purpose of the TEST bit in normal operation","The TEST bit is normally used for testing purposes, however, it can be used to synchronize Oscillator 1 to external events, allowing the generation of highly complex waveforms under real-time software control."
"what is the effect of sweeping the pulse width in real-time","A dynamic 'phasing' effect which adds a sense of motion to the sound is produced."
"what is the effect of rapidly jumping between different pulse widths","Interesting harmonic sequences are produced."
"what is the use of Noise in sound creation","Noise is useful in creating explosions, gunshots, jet engines, wind, surf and other unpitched sounds, as well as snore drums and cymbals."
"what is the effect of sweeping the oscillator frequency with Noise selected","A dramatic rushing effect is produced."
