question,answer
"what is the first type of sprite collision detected?","A collision between two sprites occurs when non-transparent output data of two sprites are coincident."
"what happens when a collision occurs between two sprites?","The sprite bits (MnM) in the sprite-sprite COLLISION register 30 ($1E) will be set to '1' for both colliding sprites."
"what happens to the collision bits after a read of the collision register?","The collision bits remain set until a read of the collision register, when all bits are automatically cleared."
"are sprites collisions detected even if positioned off-screen?","Yes, sprites collisions are detected even if positioned off-screen."
"what is the second type of collision detected?","A sprite-DATA collision between a sprite and foreground display data from the character or bit map modes."
"what is the purpose of the sprite-DATA COLLISION register 31 ($1F)?","The sprite-DATA COLLISION register 31 ($1F) has a 'bit (MnD) for each sprite which is set to '1' when both the sprite and non-background display data are coincident."
"what does not generate a collision in sprite-DATA collision?","The coincidence of only transparent data does not generate a collision."
"what is a special feature of the display data from the 0-1 multicolor bit pair?","The display data from the 0-1 multicolor bit pair also does not cause a collision."
"why is the display data from the 0-1 multicolor bit pair special?","This feature permits their use as background display data without interfering with true sprite collisions."
"can a sprite-DATA collision occur off-screen?","A sprite-DATA collision can occur off-screen in the horizontal direction if actual display data has been scrolled to an off-screen position."
"what happens to the sprite-DATA COLLISION register when read?","The sprite-DATA COLLISION register also automatically clears when read."
"what triggers the collision interrupt latches?","The collision interrupt latches are set whenever the first bit of either register is set to '1'."
"what happens to subsequent collisions after the collision interrupt latches are set?","Once any collision bit within a register is set high, subsequent collisions will not set the interrupt latch until that collision register has been cleared to all '0s' by a read."
"what is the purpose of the sprite-sprite COLLISION register 30 ($1E)?","The sprite-sprite COLLISION register 30 ($1E) has bits (MnM) that are set to '1' for both colliding sprites when a collision occurs."
"what is the difference between sprite-sprite collision and sprite-DATA collision?","Sprite-sprite collision occurs between two sprites, while sprite-DATA collision occurs between a sprite and foreground display data."
"can a collision occur between two transparent sprites?","No, coincidence of sprite transparent areas will not generate a collision."
"what is the purpose of the collision registers?","The collision registers detect and store information about sprite collisions."
"how many types of sprite collisions are detected?","Two types of sprite collisions are detected: sprite to sprite and sprite to display data."
"what is the purpose of the collision interrupt latches?","The collision interrupt latches are set whenever the first bit of either register is set to '1'."
"what happens when a sprite collides with display data?","The sprite-DATA COLLISION register 31 ($1F) has a 'bit (MnD) for each sprite which is set to '1' when both the sprite and non-background display data are coincident."
"can a sprite collision occur off-screen in the vertical direction?","The text does not specify whether a sprite collision can occur off-screen in the vertical direction."
"what is the purpose of the sprite bits (MnM)?","The sprite bits (MnM) in the sprite-sprite COLLISION register 30 ($1E) are set to '1' for both colliding sprites when a collision occurs."
"what is the purpose of the bit (MnD)?","The bit (MnD) in the sprite-DATA COLLISION register 31 ($1F) is set to '1' when both the sprite and non-background display data are coincident."
"what happens when a sprite collides with another sprite?","The sprite bits (MnM) in the sprite-sprite COLLISION register 30 ($1E) will be set to '1' for both colliding sprites."
"can a sprite-DATA collision occur on-screen?","A sprite-DATA collision can occur on-screen if the sprite and non-background display data are coincident."
"what is the purpose of clearing the collision registers?","Clearing the collision registers allows subsequent collisions to set the interrupt latch again."
"what happens when the collision registers are cleared?","The collision registers are automatically cleared when read."
