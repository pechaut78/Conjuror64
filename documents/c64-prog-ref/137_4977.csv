question,answer
"What is the opcode for the INC instruction in zero page addressing mode?","The opcode for the INC instruction in zero page addressing mode is E6, which increments the memory location by one."
"What is the difference in the number of bytes and cycles between the INC instruction in zero page and absolute addressing modes?","The INC instruction in zero page addressing mode uses 2 bytes and takes 5 cycles, whereas in absolute addressing mode it uses 3 bytes and takes 6 cycles."
"How does the INC instruction behave when used with the X register in zero page addressing mode?","When used with the X register in zero page addressing mode, the INC instruction increments the memory location specified by the X register, and the opcode is F6, using 2 bytes and taking 6 cycles."
"What is the purpose of the INC instruction in assembly language programming on the Commodore 64?","The INC instruction increments the value of a memory location by one, which is useful for counting, indexing, and other applications where a variable needs to be incremented."
"What is the opcode for the INC instruction in absolute addressing mode?","The opcode for the INC instruction in absolute addressing mode is EE, which increments the memory location specified by the absolute address."
"How does the INC instruction affect the flags on the Commodore 64?","The INC instruction affects the N and Z flags on the Commodore 64, setting them according to the result of the increment operation."
"What is the difference in the number of cycles between the INC instruction in zero page and zero page,X addressing modes?","The INC instruction in zero page addressing mode takes 5 cycles, whereas in zero page,X addressing mode it takes 6 cycles, due to the additional cycle required to access the memory location specified by the X register."
"What is the purpose of the X register in the INC instruction in zero page,X addressing mode?","The X register in the INC instruction in zero page,X addressing mode specifies the memory location to be incremented, allowing for flexible and efficient indexing and counting operations."
"How does the INC instruction interact with the memory architecture of the Commodore 64?","The INC instruction interacts with the memory architecture of the Commodore 64 by incrementing the value of a memory location, which can be used to implement counters, pointers, and other data structures."
"What is the relationship between the INC instruction and the DEC instruction on the Commodore 64?","The INC instruction and the DEC instruction are complementary, with the INC instruction incrementing a memory location and the DEC instruction decrementing it, allowing for flexible and efficient implementation of counters and other data structures."
