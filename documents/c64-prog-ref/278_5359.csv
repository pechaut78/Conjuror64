"what is the purpose of the MASK register in the 6526 interrupt control?","The MASK register provides convenient control of individual mask bits, allowing the user to selectively enable or disable interrupts from various sources. When writing to the MASK register, the user can set or clear individual mask bits by writing a 1 or 0 to the corresponding bit position, while leaving unaffected bits unchanged. This allows for fine-grained control over which interrupts are enabled and which are masked."
"how does the interrupt control register handle multiple interrupts?","The interrupt control register can handle multiple interrupts by setting the corresponding bit in the DATA register for each interrupt source. The IR bit (MSB) of the DATA register is set if any interrupt is enabled by the MASK register, and the /IRQ pin is brought low. This allows the processor to detect the presence of an interrupt and respond accordingly."
"what happens when an interrupt is cleared from the DATA register?","When an interrupt is cleared from the DATA register, the /IRQ line returns high, indicating that the interrupt has been serviced. The DATA register is cleared following a read of the register, which means that the interrupt information is lost unless it is preserved by the user."
"how does the 6526 handle polled interrupts?","The 6526 allows for polled interrupts by allowing the user to selectively mask individual interrupt sources. When an interrupt is masked, it does not generate an interrupt request, but the corresponding bit is still set in the DATA register. This allows the user to poll the DATA register to detect the presence of an interrupt, and then service the interrupt accordingly."
"what is the purpose of the SET/CLEAR bit in the MASK register?","The SET/CLEAR bit (bit 7) in the MASK register determines the behavior of the mask bits when writing to the register. If the SET/CLEAR bit is 0, writing a 1 to a mask bit clears it, while writing a 0 leaves it unaffected. If the SET/CLEAR bit is 1, writing a 1 to a mask bit sets it, while writing a 0 leaves it unaffected."
"how does the 6526 prioritize interrupts?","The 6526 does not have a built-in interrupt priority system. Instead, it relies on the user to prioritize interrupts by selectively masking and unmasking individual interrupt sources. This allows the user to customize the interrupt handling to suit the specific needs of their application."
"what is the function of the IR bit in the DATA register?","The IR bit (MSB) of the DATA register is set if any interrupt is enabled by the MASK register. This bit indicates the presence of an interrupt and is used to generate an interrupt request to the processor."
"how does the 6526 handle multi-chip systems?","In a multi-chip system, the IR bit can be polled to detect which chip has generated an interrupt request. This allows the user to determine which chip needs to be serviced and respond accordingly."
"what is the purpose of the DATA register in the 6526?","The DATA register provides a read-only interface to the interrupt status of the 6526. It contains a bit for each interrupt source, which is set when an interrupt occurs. The DATA register is cleared following a read, which means that the interrupt information is lost unless it is preserved by the user."
"can the 6526 generate multiple interrupt requests simultaneously?","Yes, the 6526 can generate multiple interrupt requests simultaneously. The DATA register contains a bit for each interrupt source, and multiple bits can be set simultaneously if multiple interrupts occur. The IR bit (MSB) of the DATA register is set if any interrupt is enabled by the MASK register, indicating the presence of an interrupt."
