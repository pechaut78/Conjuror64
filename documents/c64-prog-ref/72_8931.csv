question,answer
"what is the requirement for using multi-color mode in sprites","In multi-color mode, each colored 'dot' or 'block' in the sprite consists of two pixels side by side, which means you need to use pairs of pixels instead of individual pixels in your sprite picture."
"how many colors can you choose from in multi-color mode","You can choose from 4 colors in multi-color mode: Sprite Color, Multi-Color 1, Multi-Color 2, and Background Color, which is achieved by using zero settings that let the background color show through."
"what determines the color of each pair of pixels in a sprite picture","The color of each pair of pixels in a sprite picture is determined by whether the left, right, or both pixels are solid."
"in a horizontal 8-pixel block in a sprite picture, how are the pixels arranged","In a horizontal 8-pixel block in a sprite picture, each pair of pixels is arranged side by side, with the color of each pair determined by whether the left, right, or both pixels are solid."
"what is the purpose of using zero settings in multi-color mode","Using zero settings in multi-color mode allows the background color to show through, effectively making it the background color of the sprite."
"how do you achieve a background color in multi-color mode","You achieve a background color in multi-color mode by using zero settings, which allows the background color to show through."
"in multi-color mode, what happens when both pixels in a pair are solid","When both pixels in a pair are solid in multi-color mode, the resulting color is determined by the sprite color, multi-color 1, or multi-color 2, depending on the specific configuration."
"what is the significance of pairs of pixels in multi-color mode","Pairs of pixels are significant in multi-color mode because they determine the color of each 'dot' or 'block' in the sprite picture, with the color depending on whether the left, right, or both pixels are solid."
"how does the arrangement of pixels in a sprite picture affect the color","The arrangement of pixels in a sprite picture affects the color because the color of each pair of pixels is determined by whether the left, right, or both pixels are solid, which in turn determines the overall color of the sprite."
"in multi-color mode, what is the relationship between pixel pairs and color","In multi-color mode, pixel pairs are directly related to the color of the sprite, with each pair of pixels determining the color of each 'dot' or 'block' in the sprite picture."
