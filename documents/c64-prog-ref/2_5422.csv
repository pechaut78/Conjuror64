"What is the main difference between DIRECT mode and PROGRAM mode in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The main difference between DIRECT mode and PROGRAM mode in Commodore 64 BASIC is that in DIRECT mode, BASIC statements do not have line numbers and are executed immediately when the RETURN key is pressed, whereas in PROGRAM mode, BASIC statements must have line numbers and are executed when the program is run."
"What happens when you press the RETURN key in DIRECT mode?","When you press the RETURN key in DIRECT mode, the BASIC statement is executed immediately, allowing for interactive and immediate execution of BASIC commands."
"What is the purpose of the PROGRAM mode in Commodore 64 BASIC?","The purpose of the PROGRAM mode is to create and run programs, where each BASIC statement must have a line number, and the program can be executed as a whole when the RUN command is given."
"What is the character limit for a logical screen line in PROGRAM mode?","The character limit for a logical screen line in PROGRAM mode is 80 characters, which means that if a BASIC statement exceeds this limit, it must be continued on a new line with a new line number."
"Why is it important to type NEW and press RETURN before starting a new program?","Typing NEW and pressing RETURN before starting a new program is important because it clears the current program from memory, allowing you to start fresh and preventing any existing program from interfering with your new program."
"What is the significance of line numbers in PROGRAM mode?","Line numbers in PROGRAM mode are significant because they allow the BASIC interpreter to keep track of the order of execution of the program, and they enable the programmer to edit and debug the program more easily."
"How do you execute a program in PROGRAM mode?","To execute a program in PROGRAM mode, you simply type RUN and press RETURN, and the program will execute from the first line number to the last."
"What happens if you exceed the 80 character limit on a line in PROGRAM mode?","If you exceed the 80 character limit on a line in PROGRAM mode, you must continue the BASIC statement on a new line with a new line number, allowing you to break up long statements into more manageable pieces."
"What is the advantage of using DIRECT mode over PROGRAM mode?","The advantage of using DIRECT mode over PROGRAM mode is that it allows for interactive and immediate execution of BASIC commands, making it ideal for quick testing and experimentation."
"Can you have multiple BASIC statements on a single line in PROGRAM mode?","Yes, you can have multiple BASIC statements on a single line in PROGRAM mode, but you are limited by the 80 character limit, and you must separate each statement with a colon (:) or a semicolon (;)."
