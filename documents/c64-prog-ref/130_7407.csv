question,answer
"what is the opcode for the immediate addressing mode of the CMP instruction?","The opcode for the immediate addressing mode of the CMP instruction is C9, which requires 2 bytes and takes 2 cycles to execute."
"what is the difference in cycles between the zero page and absolute addressing modes of the CMP instruction?","The zero page addressing mode of the CMP instruction takes 3 cycles, while the absolute addressing mode takes 4 cycles, so the difference is 1 cycle."
"how does the CMP instruction with the (Indirect,X) addressing mode work?","The CMP instruction with the (Indirect,X) addressing mode works by first loading the value at the memory location specified by the operand plus the X register, and then comparing the accumulator with that value; this operation requires 2 bytes and takes 6 cycles to execute."
"what is the opcode for the absolute,Y addressing mode of the CMP instruction?","The opcode for the absolute,Y addressing mode of the CMP instruction is D9, which requires 3 bytes and takes 4 cycles to execute, plus an additional cycle if a page boundary is crossed."
"what is the purpose of the CMP instruction?","The purpose of the CMP instruction is to compare the value in the accumulator with the value in memory, setting the flags accordingly, but not changing the accumulator's value."
"how many bytes are required for the zero page addressing mode of the CMP instruction?","The zero page addressing mode of the CMP instruction requires 2 bytes."
"in what situations does the CMP instruction take an additional cycle to execute?","The CMP instruction takes an additional cycle to execute when a page boundary is crossed in the absolute,X and absolute,Y addressing modes."
"what is the opcode for the zero page addressing mode of the CMP instruction?","The opcode for the zero page addressing mode of the CMP instruction is C5, which requires 2 bytes and takes 3 cycles to execute."
"what is the difference between the CMP #Oper and CMP Oper instructions?","The CMP #Oper instruction compares the accumulator with an immediate value, while the CMP Oper instruction compares the accumulator with a value in memory; the former uses the immediate addressing mode, while the latter uses the zero page addressing mode."
"how does the CMP instruction affect the flags?","The CMP instruction sets the flags based on the result of the comparison, including the N, V, and C flags, but does not change the accumulator's value."
