"How are characters formed in the Commodore 64?","Each character is formed in an 8 by 8 grid of dots, where each dot may be either on or off, and the characters are stored in the Character Generator ROM chip as a set of 8 bytes for each character, with each byte representing the dot pattern of a row in the character, and each bit representing a dot, where a zero bit means that dot is off, and a one bit means the dot is on."
"What is the starting location of the character memory in ROM?","The character memory in ROM begins at location 53248 (when the I/O is switched off)."
"What is stored in the first 8 bytes of the character memory?","The first 8 bytes from location 53248 ($D000) to 53255 ($D007) contain the pattern for the @ sign, which has a character code value of zero in the screen memory."
"What is stored in the next 8 bytes of the character memory?","The next 8 bytes, from location 53256 ($D008) to 53263 ($D00F), contain the information for forming the letter A."
"How much memory does a complete character set take up?","Each complete character set takes up 2K (2048 bits) of memory, 8 bytes per character and 256 characters."
"How much memory does the character generator ROM take up in total?","The character generator ROM takes up a total of 4K locations, since there are two character sets, one for upper case and graphics and the other with upper and lower case."
"What is the organization of character data in the ROM chip?","The characters are stored as a set of 8 bytes for each character, with each byte representing the dot pattern of a row in the character, and each bit representing a dot."
"What is the significance of a zero bit in the character data?","A zero bit means that dot is off."
"What is the significance of a one bit in the character data?","A one bit means the dot is on."
"How many characters are stored in the character generator ROM?","There are 256 characters stored in the character generator ROM."
