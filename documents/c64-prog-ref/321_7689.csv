"what is the function of bit 4 in the MODE/VOL register","When set to a one, the Low-Pass output of the Filter is selected and sent to the audio output, for a given Filter input signal, all frequency components below the Filter Cutoff Frequency are passed unaltered, while all frequency components above the Cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 12 dB/Octave"
"what is the effect of setting bit 5 in the MODE/VOL register","Same as bit 4 for the Bandpass output, all frequency components above and below the Cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 6 dB/Octave, the Bandpass mode produces thin, open sounds"
"what is the function of bit 6 in the MODE/VOL register","Same as bit 4 for the High-Pass output, all frequency components above the Cutoff are passed unaltered, while all frequency components below the Cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 12 dB/Octave, the High-Pass mode produces tinny, buzzy sounds"
"what is the effect of setting bit 7 in the MODE/VOL register","When set to a one, the output of Voice 3 is disconnected from the direct audio path, setting Voice 3 to bypass the Filter and setting 3 OFF to a one prevents Voice 3 from reaching the audio output"
"what is the purpose of the Filter in SID","The Filter is, perhaps, the most important element in SID as it allows the generation of complex tone colors via subtractive synthesis, the Filter is used to eliminate specific frequency components from a harmonically rich input signal"
"how does the Filter output modes work","The Filter output modes ARE additive and multiple Filter modes may be selected simultaneously, for example, both LP and HP modes can be selected to produce a Notch or Band Reject Filter response"
"what is the requirement for the Filter to have an audible effect","At least one Filter output must be selected and at least one Voice must be routed through the Filter"
"what is the function of bits 0-3 in the MODE/VOL register","Bits 0-3 select 1 of 16 overall Volume levels for the final composite audio output, the output volume levels range from no output to maximum volume in 16 linear steps"
"what is the purpose of the Volume control","This control can be used as a static volume control for balancing levels in multi-chip systems or for creating dynamic volume effects, such as Tremolo"
"what is the minimum requirement for SID to produce sound","Some Volume level other than zero must be selected in order for SID to produce any sound"
"what is the effect of varying the Cutoff Frequency in real-time","The best results are achieved by varying the Cutoff Frequency in real-time"
"what is the function of the Filter in subtractive synthesis","The Filter is used to eliminate specific frequency components from a harmonically rich input signal"
"what is the result of selecting multiple Filter modes simultaneously","Multiple Filter modes can be selected simultaneously, for example, both LP and HP modes can be selected to produce a Notch or Band Reject Filter response"
"what is the purpose of the Filter in SID","The Filter is, perhaps, the most important element in SID as it allows the generation of complex tone colors via subtractive synthesis"
"what is the effect of setting Voice 3 to bypass the Filter and setting 3 OFF to a one","This allows Voice 3 to be used for modulation purposes without any undesirable output"
"what is the range of output volume levels in the MODE/VOL register","The output volume levels range from no output to maximum volume in 16 linear steps"
"what is the function of the MODE/VOL register","The MODE/VOL register selects various Filter mode and output options, and selects 1 of 16 overall Volume levels for the final composite audio output"
