"what is the purpose of poking V+16 with the number of the sprite being used","The purpose of poking V+16 with the number of the sprite being used is to set the sprite for display beyond the 255th X-position, allowing the sprite to be displayed on the right side of the screen. This is necessary because the X counter starts over from 0 at the 256th position on the screen, and poking V+16 with the sprite number enables the display of the sprite in this region."
"how do you display a sprite beyond the 255th X-position","To display a sprite beyond the 255th X-position, you need to POKE V+16 with the number of the sprite being used, and then set the X position, taking into account that the X counter starts over from 0 at the 256th position on the screen. For example, to display sprite 0 at X position 24, you would use the following code: POKE V+16,1:POKE V,24:POKE V+1,75."
"what is the effect of poking V+16 with the number of the sprite being used","Poking V+16 with the number of the sprite being used sets the most significant bit of the X position, allowing the sprite to be displayed beyond the 255th X-position. This enables the sprite to be displayed on the right side of the screen, starting from the 256th pixel position."
"what is the purpose of the X-Y chart in relation to sprite display","The X-Y chart is used to determine the correct settings for displaying sprites on the screen. The 'RIGHT X' row in the chart provides the necessary information for displaying sprites beyond the 255th X-position, and is used in conjunction with the POKE commands to set the X position and display the sprite correctly."
"how do you determine the correct X position for a sprite beyond the 255th X-position","To determine the correct X position for a sprite beyond the 255th X-position, you need to take into account that the X counter starts over from 0 at the 256th position on the screen. You can use the X-Y chart to determine the correct settings, and then adjust the X position accordingly. For example, to display sprite 0 at X position 24, you would use the following code: POKE V+16,1:POKE V,24:POKE V+1,75."
"what is the purpose of line 50 in the code","Line 50 in the code is used to set the X position of the sprite, taking into account that the X counter starts over from 0 at the 256th position on the screen. The code POKE V+16,1:POKE V,24:POKE V+1,75 sets the X position of sprite 0 to 24, which is 24 pixels to the right of the 255th X-position."
"how do you move sprites on the left and right sides of the screen","To move sprites on the left and right sides of the screen, you need to experiment with the settings in the sprite chart and use the correct POKE commands to set the X position. The section on 'moving sprites' provides additional information on how to move sprites around the screen."
"what is the significance of the 256th pixel position on the screen","The 256th pixel position on the screen is significant because it marks the point at which the X counter starts over from 0. This means that sprites can be displayed beyond the 255th X-position by setting the most significant bit of the X position and using the correct POKE commands."
"how do you check the right edge of the screen for sprite display","To check the right edge of the screen for sprite display, you can use the following code: POKE V+16,1:POKE V,65:POKE V+1,75. This code sets the X position of sprite 0 to 65, which is near the right edge of the screen."
"what is the relationship between the X-Y chart and sprite positioning","The X-Y chart is used to determine the correct settings for displaying sprites on the screen, including positioning beyond the 255th X-position. The chart provides the necessary information for setting the X position and displaying the sprite correctly, taking into account the wrap-around of the X counter at the 256th pixel position."
