question,answer
"What is the purpose of the /IRQ output in a device?","The /IRQ output is brought low when an enabled source of interrupt occurs within the device, indicating that an interrupt has been triggered and needs to be handled."
"What is the characteristic of the /IRQ output?","The /IRQ output is open drain, which means it requires an external pull-up resistor to function properly."
"What happens when an enabled source of interrupt occurs within the device?","When an enabled source of interrupt occurs within the device, the /IRQ output is brought low, signaling that an interrupt has been triggered and needs to be handled."
"What type of resistor is required for the /IRQ output to function?","An external pull-up resistor is required for the /IRQ output to function properly, as it is an open drain output."
"What is the effect of an enabled source of interrupt on the /IRQ output?","When an enabled source of interrupt occurs, the /IRQ output is brought low, indicating that an interrupt has been triggered and needs to be handled."
"In what situation is the /IRQ output brought low?","The /IRQ output is brought low when an enabled source of interrupt occurs within the device."
"What is the significance of the /IRQ output being open drain?","The /IRQ output being open drain means that it requires an external pull-up resistor to function properly, which is an important consideration in circuit design."
"How does the /IRQ output respond to an enabled source of interrupt?","The /IRQ output responds to an enabled source of interrupt by being brought low, signaling that an interrupt has been triggered and needs to be handled."
"What is the role of the external pull-up resistor in the /IRQ output circuit?","The external pull-up resistor is required to enable the /IRQ output to function properly, as it is an open drain output."
"What is the relationship between the /IRQ output and enabled sources of interrupt?","The /IRQ output is brought low when an enabled source of interrupt occurs within the device, indicating that an interrupt has been triggered and needs to be handled."
