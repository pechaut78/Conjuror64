"what is the purpose of the R/W input in a C64 system?","The R/W input determines the direction of data transfer on the data bus, in conjunction with /CS, where a high signal indicates data transfer from the selected register to the data bus output, and a low signal indicates data presented on the data bus pins is loaded into the selected register."
"what happens when the R/W input is high?","When the R/W input is high, data is transferred from the selected register to the data bus output, allowing the system to read data from the register."
"what is the function of the R/W input in conjunction with /CS?","The R/W input, in conjunction with /CS, determines the direction of data transfer on the data bus, controlling whether data is read from or written to the selected register."
"what is the effect of a low R/W input signal?","A low R/W input signal indicates that data presented on the data bus pins is loaded into the selected register, allowing the system to write data to the register."
"in what way does the R/W input influence data transfer on the data bus?","The R/W input influences data transfer on the data bus by determining the direction of data transfer, where a high signal indicates a read operation and a low signal indicates a write operation."
"what is the relationship between the R/W input and the data bus?","The R/W input controls the direction of data transfer on the data bus, where a high signal enables data transfer from the selected register to the data bus output, and a low signal enables data transfer from the data bus pins to the selected register."
"how does the R/W input interact with the /CS signal?","The R/W input interacts with the /CS signal to determine the direction of data transfer on the data bus, where the /CS signal selects the register and the R/W input determines the direction of data transfer."
"in what way does the R/W input control data transfer?","The R/W input controls data transfer by determining the direction of data transfer, where a high signal indicates a read operation and a low signal indicates a write operation, allowing the system to control the flow of data."
"what is the significance of the R/W input in a C64 system?","The R/W input is significant in a C64 system as it determines the direction of data transfer on the data bus, controlling whether data is read from or written to the selected register."
"how does the R/W input affect the data bus?","The R/W input affects the data bus by controlling the direction of data transfer, where a high signal enables data transfer from the selected register to the data bus output, and a low signal enables data transfer from the data bus pins to the selected register."
