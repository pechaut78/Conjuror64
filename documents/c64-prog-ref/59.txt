  POSITIONING SPRITES ON THE SCREEN

    The entire display screen is divided into a grid of X and Y coordi-
  nates, like a graph. The X COORDINATE is the HORIZONTAL position across
  the screen and the Y COORDINATE is the VERTICAL position up and down (see
  Figure 3-4).
    To position any sprite on the screen, you must POKE TWO SETTINGS...
  the X position and the Y position... these tell the computer where to
  display the UPPER LEFT HAND CORNER of the sprite. Remember that a sprite
  consists of 504 individual pixels, 24 across by 21 down... so if you POKE
  a sprite onto the upper left corner of your screen, the sprite will be
  displayed as a graphic image 24 pixels ACROSS and 21 pixels DOWN starting
  at the X-Y position you defined. The sprite will be displayed based on
  the upper left corner of the entire sprite, even if you define the sprite
  using only a small part of the 24X21-pixel sprite area.
    To understand how X-Y positioning works, study the following diagram
  (Figure 3-5), which shows the X and Y numbers in relation to your display
  screen. Note that the GREY AREA in the diagram shows your television
  viewing area... the white area represents positions which are OFF your
  viewing screen...

    To display a sprite in a given location, You must POKE the X and Y
  settings for each SPRITE... remembering that every sprite has its own
  unique X POKE and Y POKE.
