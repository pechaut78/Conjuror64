"What is bit mapping in the context of graphics?","Bit mapping is the method in which each possible dot (pixel) of resolution on the screen is assigned its own bit (location) in memory."
"What is the main advantage of using bit mapping?","The main advantage is that it allows for high-resolution displays."
"Why is bit mapping not used all the time?","It takes lots of memory to bit map the entire screen."
"How much memory is needed to map the whole screen?","8000 bytes of memory are needed to map the whole screen."
"What is the resolution of the Commodore 64 screen?","The resolution is 320 pixels by 200 pixels for the whole screen."
"Why are high-resolution operations slow in BASIC?","High-resolution operations are slow in BASIC because they are made of many short, simple, repetitive routines."
"What is the solution to the slow performance of high-resolution operations in BASIC?","The solution is to either write your programs entirely in machine language, or call machine language, high-resolution sub-routines from your BASIC program using the SYS command from BASIC."
"What is the VSP cartridge used for?","The VSP cartridge is used to add high-resolution commands to COMMODORE 64 BASIC."
"What is the main difference between writing in BASIC and machine language?","Machine language is faster than BASIC for graphics."
"What is the main advantage of using machine language for graphics?","Machine language is faster than BASIC for graphics."
"What is the main disadvantage of using machine language for graphics?","Machine language is more difficult to write than BASIC for graphics."
"What is the main advantage of using the SYS command?","The main advantage is that it allows you to call machine language, high-resolution sub-routines from your BASIC program."
"What is the main disadvantage of using the SYS command?","The main disadvantage is that it requires you to write your programs in machine language."
"What is the main advantage of using the VSP cartridge?","The main advantage is that it adds high-resolution commands to COMMODORE 64 BASIC."
"What is the main disadvantage of using the VSP cartridge?","The main disadvantage is that it requires additional hardware."
