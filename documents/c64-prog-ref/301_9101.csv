question,answer
"what is the purpose of the raster register?","The raster register is a dual-function register that returns the lower 8 bits of the current raster position when read, and can be written to latch a value for an internal raster compare, triggering a raster interrupt when the current raster matches the written value."
"what is the location of the MSB-RC8 bit in the raster register?","The MSB-RC8 bit is located in register 17 ($11), which is separate from the lower 8 bits of the raster position in register 18 ($12)."
"what is the purpose of interrogating the raster register?","Interrogating the raster register allows for implementing display changes outside the visible area, thereby preventing display flicker."
"what is the visible display window in terms of raster lines?","The visible display window is from raster 51 through raster 251 ($033-$0FB)."
"what happens when the current raster matches the written value in the raster register?","When the current raster matches the written value, the raster interrupt latch is set."
"what is the effect of writing to the raster bits in the raster register?","Writing to the raster bits, including RC8, latches the value for an internal raster compare, which triggers a raster interrupt when the current raster matches the written value."
"what is the address of the raster register?","The address of the raster register is $12 (18 decimal)."
"what is the significance of register 17 ($11) in relation to the raster register?","Register 17 ($11) contains the MSB-RC8 bit, which is part of the raster position and is separate from the lower 8 bits in the raster register."
"how can display flicker be prevented when making display changes?","Display flicker can be prevented by interrogating the raster register to implement display changes outside the visible area."
"what is the purpose of the internal raster compare in the raster register?","The internal raster compare in the raster register is used to trigger a raster interrupt when the current raster matches the written value, allowing for precise timing of display changes."
