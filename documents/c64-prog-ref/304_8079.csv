question,answer
"what is the purpose of the AEC signal in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The AEC signal is used to disable the processor address bus drivers allowing the video device to access the address bus."
"what is the frequency of the clock provided by the video chips?","The video chips provide a 1-MHz clock."
"what is the duration of a memory cycle in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","A memory cycle is 500 ns including address setup, data access and, data setup to the reading device."
"what is the purpose of the BA signal in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The BA signal is used to indicate that the video chip will require a Phase 2 data access."
"how many Phase-2 times are allowed after BA low for the processor to complete any current memory accesses?","Three Phase-2 times are allowed after BA low for the processor to complete any current memory accesses."
"what happens on the fourth Phase 2 after BA low?","On the fourth Phase 2 after BA low, the AEC signal will remain low during Phase 2 as the video chip fetches data."
"what is the purpose of the character pointer fetches in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The character pointer fetches occur every eighth raster line during the display window and require 40 consecutive Phase 2 accesses to fetch the video matrix pointers."
"how many memory accesses are required for sprite data fetches?","The sprite data fetches require 4 memory accesses."
"what is the condition for sprite Byte 1 fetch?","The sprite Byte 1 is fetched in Phase 2, each raster while sprite is displayed."
"what is the condition for sprite Byte 2 fetch?","The sprite Byte 2 is fetched in Phase 1, each raster while sprite is displayed."
"what is the condition for sprite Byte 3 fetch?","The sprite Byte 3 is fetched in Phase 2, each raster while sprite is displayed."
"when are sprite pointers fetched?","The sprite pointers are fetched every other Phase 1 at the end of each raster line."
"what is the purpose of the bus "sharing" in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The bus "sharing" allows the video device to access the address bus without affecting the processor operation."
"what is the advantage of the bus "sharing" in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The bus "sharing" allows operations such as character data fetches and memory refresh to be totally transparent to the processor and do not reduce the processor throughput."
"what is the function of the 6566/6567 video controller devices in the system?","The 6566/6567 video controller devices interact with the system data bus in a special way, allowing the video device to access the address bus without affecting the processor operation."
"what is the role of the video chips in the system?","The video chips provide the interface control signals required to maintain the bus sharing."
"what is the purpose of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clock cycles in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The Phase 1 and Phase 2 clock cycles are used to access the system memory and maintain the bus sharing."
"what is the relationship between the 6566/6567 video controller devices and the 65XX system?","The 6566/6567 video controller devices are designed to work with the 65XX system, using the system buses only during the Phase 2 (clock high) portion of the cycle."
"what is the benefit of using the 6566/6567 video controller devices in the 65XX system?","The use of the 6566/6567 video controller devices in the 65XX system allows for efficient use of the system buses and minimizes the impact on the processor throughput."
"how do the 6566/6567 video controller devices access the system memory?","The 6566/6567 video controller devices access the system memory during the Phase 1 (clock low) portion of the clock cycle."
"what is the purpose of the RDY input of a 65XX processor?","The RDY input of a 65XX processor is connected to the BA line, which indicates that the video chip will require a Phase 2 data access."
"what is the function of the BA line in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The BA line is used to indicate that the video chip will require a Phase 2 data access."
"what is the purpose of the sprite data fetches in the 6566/6567 video controller devices?","The sprite data fetches are used to retrieve sprite data from the system memory."
"how many sprite data fetches are required?","Four sprite data fetches are required."
"what is the condition for sprite data fetches?","The sprite data fetches occur every raster while the sprite is displayed."
