  B-24. Function Name: SAVE

    Purpose: Save memory to a device
    Call address: $FFD8 (hex) 65496 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
    Error returns: 5,8,9, READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine saves a section of memory. Memory is saved
  from an indirect address on page 0 specified by the accumulator to the
  address stored in the X and Y registers. It is then sent to a logical
  file on an input/output device. The SETLFS and SETNAM routines must be
  used before calling this routine. However, a file name is not required to
  SAVE to device 1 (the Datassette(TM) recorder). Any attempt to save to
  other devices without using a file name results in an error.

  
  NOTE: Device 0 (the keyboard), device 2 (RS-232), and device 3 (the 
  screen) cannot be SAVEd to. If the attempt is made, an error occurs,
  and the SAVE is stopped.                                            

  How to Use:

    0) Use the SETLFS routine and the SETNAM routine (unless a SAVE with no
       file name is desired on "a save to the tape recorder"),
    1) Load two consecutive locations on page 0 with a pointer to the start
       of your save (in standard 6502 low byte first, high byte next
       format).
    2) Load the accumulator with the single byte page zero offset to the
       pointer.
    3) Load the X and Y registers with the low byte and high byte re-
       spectively of the location of the end of the save.
    4) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    LDA #1              ;DEVICE = 1:CASSETTE
    JSR SETLFS
    LDA #0              ;NO FILE NAME
    JSR SETNAM
    LDA PROG            ;LOAD START ADDRESS OF SAVE
    STA TXTTAB          ;(LOW BYTE)
    LDA PROG+1
    STA TXTTA B+1       ;(HIGH BYTE)
    LDX VARTAB          ;LOAD X WITH LOW BYTE OF END OF SAVE
    LDY VARTAB+1        ;LOAD Y WITH HIGH BYTE
    LDA #<TXTTAB        ;LOAD ACCUMULATOR WITH PAGE 0 OFFSET
    JSR SAVE
