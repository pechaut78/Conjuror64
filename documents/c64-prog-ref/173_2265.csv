question,answer
"What is the problem facing programmers in the microcomputer field?","The problem is that changes to the operating system by the company can make machine language programs obsolete."
"What is the KERNAL?","The KERNAL is a standardized JUMP TABLE to the input, output, and memory management routines in the operating system."
"What is the purpose of the KERNAL?","The purpose of the KERNAL is to protect software writers from changes to the operating system."
"How does the KERNAL alleviate the problem of changes to the operating system?","The KERNAL alleviates the problem by providing a standardized jump table that always matches the locations of the system ROM routines."
"What is the KERNAL jump table located in?","The KERNAL jump table is located on the last page of memory, in read-only memory (ROM)."
"What is the benefit of using the KERNAL jump table?","The benefit is that it saves time and makes it easier to translate programs from one Commodore computer to another."
"How do you use the KERNAL jump table?","You set up the parameters that the KERNAL routine needs to work, then JSR to the proper place in the KERNAL jump table."
"What happens after the KERNAL routine performs its function?","The KERNAL transfers control back to your machine language program."
"What is the purpose of the registers in the KERNAL routine?","The registers pass parameters back to your program."
"Why is the jump table used instead of JSR directly to the KERNAL subroutine?","The jump table is used so that if the KERNAL or BASIC is changed, your machine language programs will still work."
"What happens to the KERNAL routines if the operating system is changed?","The KERNAL routines may have their memory locations moved around to a different position in the memory map."
"How does the jump table ensure compatibility with future operating systems?","The jump table will still work correctly even if the KERNAL or BASIC is changed."
"What is the advantage of using the KERNAL jump table?","The advantage is that your machine language programs will not become obsolete even if the operating system is changed."
"What is the KERNAL responsible for in the Commodore 64 computer?","The KERNAL is responsible for controlling all input, output, and memory management."
"How many input/output routines are available in the KERNAL jump table?","There are 39 input/output routines available in the KERNAL jump table."
"What is the benefit of using the KERNAL jump table for machine language programs?","The benefit is that it takes much less work to modify them if the operating system is changed."
"What is the KERNAL jump table used for?","The KERNAL jump table is used to simplify machine language programs and ensure compatibility with future operating systems."
"How does the KERNAL jump table make it easier to translate programs?","The KERNAL jump table makes it easier to translate programs from one Commodore computer to another."
"What is the purpose of the parameters in the KERNAL routine?","The parameters are used to set up the KERNAL routine to work properly."
"What happens to the control after the KERNAL routine performs its function?","The control is transferred back to your machine language program."
"What is the advantage of using the KERNAL jump table for software writers?","The advantage is that it protects software writers from changes to the operating system."
"How does the KERNAL jump table ensure that machine language programs remain compatible?","The KERNAL jump table ensures that machine language programs remain compatible by providing a standardized interface to the operating system."
"What is the benefit of using the KERNAL jump table for future-proofing?","The benefit is that it ensures that machine language programs will still work even if the operating system is changed."
"What is the purpose of the ROM in the KERNAL jump table?","The ROM is used to store the KERNAL jump table in read-only memory."
"How does the KERNAL jump table simplify machine language programs?","The KERNAL jump table simplifies machine language programs by providing a standardized interface to the operating system."
"What is the benefit of using the KERNAL jump table for machine language programmers?","The benefit is that it saves time and makes it easier to develop machine language programs."
"What is the purpose of the KERNAL in the Commodore 64 computer?","The purpose of the KERNAL is to provide a standardized interface to the operating system for machine language programs."
"What is the advantage of using the KERNAL jump table for compatibility?","The advantage is that it ensures that machine language programs will still work even if the operating system is changed."
