  SPRITE TO SPRITE COLLISIONS

    Sprite to sprite collisions are recognized by the computer, or flagged,
  in the sprite to sprite collision register at location 53278 ($D01E in
  HEX) in the VIC-II chip control register. Each sprite has a bit in this
  register. If that bit is a 1, then that sprite is involved in a
  collision. The bits in this register will remain set until read (PEEKed).
  Once read, the register is automatically cleared, so it is a good idea to
  save the value in a variable until you are finished with it.
  
   NOTE: Collisions can take place even when the sprites are off screen.
