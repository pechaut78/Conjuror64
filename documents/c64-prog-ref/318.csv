question,answer
"Does the GATE bit control the Envelope Generator for Voice 1?","Yes"
"What happens when the GATE bit is set to a one?","The Envelope Generator is triggered and the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle is initiated"
"What is the purpose of the SYNC bit?","To synchronize the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 3"
"What is the effect of varying the frequency of Oscillator 1 with respect to Oscillator 3?","It produces a wide range of complex harmonic structures from Voice I at the frequency of Oscillator 3"
"What is the purpose of the RING MOD bit?","To replace the Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1 with a 'Ring Modulated' combination of Oscillators 1 and 3"
"What is the effect of varying the frequency of Oscillator 1 with respect to Oscillator 3 in Ring Modulation?","It produces a wide range of non-harmonic overtone structures for creating bell or gong sounds and for special effects"
"What is the purpose of the TEST bit?","To reset and lock Oscillator 1 at zero until the TEST bit is cleared"
"What is the effect of setting the TEST bit to a one?","The Noise waveform output of Oscillator 1 is reset and the Pulse waveform output is held at a DC level"
"What is the purpose of the (Bit 4) bit?","To select the Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1"
"What is the characteristic of the Triangle waveform output?","It is low in harmonics and has a mellow, flute-like quality"
"What is the purpose of the (Bit 5) bit?","To select the Sawtooth waveform output of Oscillator 1"
"What is the characteristic of the Sawtooth waveform output?","It is rich in even and odd harmonics and has a bright, brassy quality"
"What is the purpose of the (Bit 6) bit?","To select the Pulse waveform output of Oscillator 1"
"What is the effect of adjusting the Pulse Width registers?","It produces tone qualities ranging from a bright, hollow square wave to a nasal, reedy pulse"
"What is the purpose of the NOISE bit?","To select the Noise output waveform of Oscillator 1"
"What is the characteristic of the Noise output waveform?","It is a random signal which changes at the frequency of Oscillator 1"
"What is the effect of sweeping the oscillator frequency with Noise selected?","It produces a dramatic rushing effect"
"What happens when more than one output waveform is selected simultaneously?","The result is a logical ANDing of the waveforms"
"What is the effect of selecting Noise while another waveform is selected?","The Noise output can 'lock up' and remain silent until reset by the TEST bit or by bringing RES low"
"What is the purpose of the Envelope Generator?","To control the amplitude of Oscillator 1 appearing at the audio output"
"What is the purpose of the GATE bit in the Envelope Generator?","To initiate the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle"
"What is the purpose of the SYNC bit in the Envelope Generator?","To synchronize the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 3"
"What is the purpose of the RING MOD bit in the Envelope Generator?","To replace the Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1 with a 'Ring Modulated' combination of Oscillators 1 and 3"
