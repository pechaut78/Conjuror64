"what instruction sets the zero result flag?","LDA #$00"
"what does the BEQ instruction mean?","Branch if result EQual to zero"
"what is the opposite of the BEQ instruction?","BNE, which means Branch on result Not Equal to zero"
"what is the purpose of the index registers?","to modify their contents"
"what does the INX instruction do?","INcrements the X index register"
"what happens when the X register is incremented from $FF?","it wraps around back to zero"
"what is the opposite of the INX instruction?","DEX, which DEcrements the X index register"
"what happens when the X index register is zero and DEX is executed?","it wraps around to $FF"
"what are CPX and CPY used for?","to compare the index registers with specific values or memory locations"
"what instruction is used to compare the X register with a specific value?","CPX"
"what is the purpose of the compare and branch instructions?","to play a major part in any machine language program"
"what is the operand specified in a branch instruction when using 64MON?","the address of the part of the program that the branch goes to"

"what is the total range of a branch instruction in 64MON?","255 bytes"
"what happens if a branch instruction is out of range in 64MON?","it refuses to assemble that particular instruction"
"what is the advantage of using an assembler like 64MON?","it calculates the correct offset for branch instructions"
"what is the purpose of the status register?","to store flags affected by different instructions"
"what is the zero result flag also known as?","Z"
"what is the opposite of the BEQ instruction in terms of the zero result flag?","BNE, which branches if Z is not set"
"what is the purpose of the branch instructions?","to branch to another part of the program based on certain conditions"
"what is the advantage of using branch instructions?","they allow for more complex program flow"
"what is the difference between a branch instruction and a jump instruction?","branch instructions examine the status register, while jump instructions do not"
