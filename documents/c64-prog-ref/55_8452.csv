question,answer
"Where is the INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER located?","The INTERRUPT ENABLE REGISTER is located at 53274 ($D01A)."
"What is the purpose of the interrupt enable register?","The purpose of the interrupt enable register is to enable or disable interrupts from specific sources, and unless the corresponding bit in the interrupt enable register is set to a 1, no interrupt from that source will take place."
"How do you enable an interrupt request?","To enable an interrupt request, the corresponding interrupt enable bit must be set to a 1."
"What is the benefit of using interrupts in split screen modes?","The benefit of using interrupts in split screen modes is that you can have half of the screen bit mapped, half text, more than 8 sprites at a time, etc."
"How can you display more than 8 sprites on the screen?","You can display more than 8 sprites by using interrupts to switch between different modes, for example, by setting the raster compare register to interrupt at the top of the screen, and then telling the VIC-II chip to get characters from RAM (bit map mode)."
"What is the role of the raster compare register in split screen modes?","The raster compare register is used to set the point at which the interrupt occurs, for example, halfway down the screen, and when the interrupt occurs, the VIC-II chip is told to get characters from ROM or RAM."
"Why is machine language preferred over BASIC for using display interrupts?","Machine language is preferred over BASIC for using display interrupts because BASIC isn't fast enough to handle the interrupts efficiently."
"What happens if the corresponding bit in the interrupt enable register is not set to a 1?","If the corresponding bit in the interrupt enable register is not set to a 1, no interrupt from that source will take place, but the interrupt status register can still be polled for information."
"How can you use interrupts to achieve complex screen modes?","You can use interrupts to achieve complex screen modes by setting the raster compare register to interrupt at specific points on the screen, and then switching between different modes, such as bit mapped and text modes."
"What is the advantage of using interrupts in graphics programming?","The advantage of using interrupts in graphics programming is that it allows for more complex and dynamic screen modes, such as split screens and multiple sprites, which would not be possible otherwise."
