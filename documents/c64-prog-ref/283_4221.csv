"what is the purpose of multi-color mode in c64?","Multi-color mode provides additional color flexibility allowing up to four colors within each character but with reduced resolution, which is selected by setting the MCM bit in register 22 ($16) to '1'."
"how does the multi-color mode interpret the dot data stored in the character base?","In multi-color mode, the dot data stored in the character base is interpreted differently, where if the MSB of the color nybble is a '0', the character will be displayed as described in standard character mode, and if the MSB of the color nybble is a '1', the character bits are interpreted in the multi-color mode."
"what is the function of the MSB of the color nybble in multi-color mode?","The MSB of the color nybble determines the mode of interpretation, where if it's '0', the character is displayed in standard mode, and if it's '1', the character is displayed in multi-color mode."
"how many colors can be displayed in each character region in multi-color mode?","Each character region can now contain 4 different colors, two as foreground and two as background, which is achieved by using two bits to specify one dot color."
"what is the resolution of the character in multi-color mode?","The character is displayed as a 4*8 matrix with each dot twice the horizontal size as in standard mode, resulting in reduced resolution."
"what is the purpose of registers 33, 34, and 35 in multi-color mode?","Registers 33, 34, and 35 specify the colors for background #0, background #1, and background #2, respectively, in multi-color mode."
"how does the sprite priority work in multi-color mode?","The sprite priority is affected by the multi-color mode, where each character region can now contain 4 different colors, two as foreground and two as background, which is important to consider when working with sprites."
"what is the advantage of using multi-color mode over standard character mode?","The advantage of using multi-color mode is that it provides additional color flexibility, allowing up to four colors within each character, although at the cost of reduced resolution."
"can standard character mode and multi-color mode be inter-mixed?","Yes, standard character mode and multi-color mode can be inter-mixed, as the MSB of the color nybble determines the mode of interpretation, allowing for a mix of both modes."
"what is the significance of the MCM bit in register 22 ($16) in multi-color mode?","The MCM bit in register 22 ($16) is used to select the multi-color mode, where setting it to '1' enables multi-color mode and setting it to '0' enables standard character mode."
