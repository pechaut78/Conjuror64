SPRITES

    The movable object block (sprite) is a special type of character which can
  be displayed at any one position on the screen without the block
  constraints inherent in character and bit map mode. Up to 8 unique sprites
  can be displayed simultaneously, each defined by 63 bytes in memory which
  are displayed as a 24*21 dot array (shown below). A number of special
  features make sprites especially suited for video graphics and game
  applications.
