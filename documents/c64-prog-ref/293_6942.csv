"what is the function of the MnXE register in the Commodore 64?","The MnXE register is used to control the horizontal expansion of a sprite, where a value of '1' enables expansion and a value of '0' sets it to normal size."
"How does the vertical expansion of a sprite work on the Commodore 64?","The vertical expansion of a sprite is controlled by the MnYE register, where a value of '1' enables expansion and a value of '0' sets it to normal size, allowing the sprite to be doubled in the vertical direction."
"What is the effect of expanding a sprite on the Commodore 64?","Expanding a sprite on the Commodore 64 does not increase the resolution, but rather doubles the overall sprite dimension in the desired direction, with the smallest sprite dot potentially becoming up to 4 times the standard dot dimension if the sprite is both multi-colored and expanded."
"What is the default size of a sprite on the Commodore 64?","The default size of a sprite on the Commodore 64 is a 24x21 array, which can be doubled in size through expansion."
"How do you enable horizontal expansion of a sprite on the Commodore 64?","To enable horizontal expansion of a sprite on the Commodore 64, you need to set the MnXE register to '1', which will double the sprite's size in the horizontal direction."
"What is the register address for controlling vertical expansion of a sprite?","The register address for controlling vertical expansion of a sprite is $1D, which corresponds to the MnYE register."
"What is the effect of setting MnXE to '0'?","Setting MnXE to '0' sets the sprite to its normal size, disabling horizontal expansion."
"Can a sprite be expanded in both horizontal and vertical directions on the Commodore 64?","Yes, a sprite can be expanded in both horizontal and vertical directions on the Commodore 64 by setting both MnXE and MnYE registers to '1'."
"What is the size of a multi-colored sprite on the Commodore 64?","A multi-colored sprite on the Commodore 64 is a 12x21 array, which can be doubled in size through expansion."
"How do you control the magnification of a sprite on the Commodore 64?","The magnification of a sprite on the Commodore 64 is controlled through the MnXE and MnYE registers, which allow for selective expansion in the horizontal and vertical directions."
