question,answer
"Where is the interrupt status register located?","The interrupt status register is located at 53273 ($D019)."
"What is the purpose of bit 7 in the interrupt status register?","Bit 7 is set with a 1 whenever an interrupt occurs."
"What happens when two sprites hit each other?","The current status of bit 2 of the interrupt register will be a 1 when two sprites hit each other."
"How do you clear an interrupt bit?","Once an interrupt bit has been set, it's 'latched' in and must be cleared by writing a 1 to that bit in the interrupt register when you're ready to handle it."
"What is the function of IRST (bit 0) in the interrupt status register?","IRST (bit 0) is set when the current raster count equals the stored raster count."
"What triggers the setting of IMDC (bit 1) in the interrupt status register?","IMDC (bit 1) is set by SPRITE-DATA collision (1st one only, until reset)."
"What is the function of ILP (bit 3) in the interrupt status register?","ILP (bit 3) is set by a negative transition of the light pen (1 per frame)."
"How does the interrupt status register allow for selective interrupt handling?","The interrupt status register allows for selective interrupt handling by allowing you to clear individual interrupt bits by writing a 1 to that bit in the interrupt register when you're ready to handle it, without having to store the other interrupt bits."
"What is the significance of the 'latched' state of an interrupt bit?","Once an interrupt bit has been set, it's 'latched' in and must be cleared by writing a 1 to that bit in the interrupt register when you're ready to handle it."
"What is the relationship between the bits in the interrupt status register and the interrupt sources?","The current status of bits 0-3 in the interrupt register corresponds to a 1 to 1 relationship with the interrupt sources, including SPRITE-DATA collision, SPRITE-SPRITE collision, and negative transition of the light pen."
