question,answer
"what is the numerical value stored in the SID Oscillator frequency control registers to produce the notes of the equal-tempered musical scale","The numerical values which must be stored in the SID Oscillator frequency control registers to produce the notes of the equal-tempered musical scale are listed in the table in Appendix E"
"what is the equal-tempered scale","The equal-tempered scale consists of an octave containing 12 semitones (notes): C,D,E,F,G,A,B and C#,D#,F#,G#,A#"
"how is the frequency of each semitone calculated","The frequency of each semitone is exactly the 12th root of 2 times the frequency of the previous semitone"
"what is the frequency of A-4 in concert pitch","440 Hz"
"what is the advantage of determining the note value algorithmically","Memory efficiency can be improved by determining the note value algorithmically"
"how can the note look-up table be reduced","The note look-up table can be reduced from 96 entries to 12 entries, as there are 12 notes per octave"
"what is the formula to derive notes in lower octaves","Notes in lower octaves can be derived by choosing the appropriate note in the eighth octave and dividing the 16-bit value by two for each octave of difference"
"why is division by two equivalent to a right-shift of the value","Division by two is nothing more than a right-shift of the value"
"what is the purpose of including note B-7 in the table","Note B-7 is included in the table for calculation purposes"
"how is the information about the semitone and octave specified","Each note must be specified in a form which indicates which of the 12 semitones is desired, and which of the eight octaves the semitone is in"
"how many bits are necessary to select 1 of 12 semitones","Four bits are necessary to select 1 of 12 semitones"
"how many bits are necessary to select 1 of 8 octaves","Three bits are necessary to select 1 of 8 octaves"
"how can the information fit in one byte","The information can fit in one byte, with the lower nybble selecting the semitone (by addressing the look-up table) and the upper nybble being used by the division routine to determine how many times the table value must be right-shifted"
"what is the purpose of the upper nybble in the byte","The upper nybble is used by the division routine to determine how many times the table value must be right-shifted"
"what is the purpose of the lower nybble in the byte","The lower nybble selects the semitone (by addressing the look-up table)"
"what is the advantage of using a software routine to calculate notes","The calculation can easily be accomplished by a simple software routine"
"what is the formula to calculate notes in higher octaves","Each note in an octave is exactly half the frequency of that note in the next octave"
"what is the range of the oscillators","The range of the oscillators is limited, and note B-7 is beyond the range of the oscillators"
"what is the purpose of the table in Appendix E","The table in Appendix E provides a simple and quick method for generating the equal-tempered scale"
"what is the disadvantage of using the table in Appendix E","The table in Appendix E is very memory inefficient as it requires 192 bytes for the table alone"
"what is the alternative to using the table in Appendix E","Determining the note value algorithmically is an alternative to using the table in Appendix E"
"what is the advantage of using a 16-bit value for each note","The 16-bit value for each note can be divided by two for each octave of difference"
"what is the purpose of the MSB of B-7","The MSB of B-7 would require a special software case, such as generating this bit in the CARRY before shifting"
