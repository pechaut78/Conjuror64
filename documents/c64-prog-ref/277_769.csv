question,answer
"what is the serial port system","a buffered, 8-bit synchronous shift register system"
"what determines the mode of the serial port","a control bit"
"in input mode, what triggers the shift of data into the shift register","the rising edge of the signal applied to the CNT pin"
"how many CNT pulses are required to dump data into the Serial Data Register","8"
"in output mode, what is used for the baud rate generator","TIMER A"
"what determines the maximum useable baud rate","line loading and the speed at which the receiver responds to input data"
"what triggers the start of transmission","a write to the Serial Data Register"
"what appears as an output on the CNT pin","the clock signal derived from TIMER A"
"when does data shifted out become valid","on the falling edge of CNT"
"how often is an interrupt generated","after 8 CNT pulses"
"what happens if the Serial Data Register is loaded with new information prior to the interrupt","the new data will automatically be loaded into the shift register and transmission will continue"
"what is required for continuous transmission","the microprocessor staying one byte ahead of the shift register"
"what happens to CNT and SP if no further data is to be transmitted","CNT will return high and SP will remain at the level of the last data bit transmitted"
"in what format is SDR data shifted out","MSB first"
"what is the capability of the Serial Port and CNT clock","bidirectional"
"how can multiple 6526 devices be connected","to a common serial communication bus"
"what is the role of one 6526 device in a common bus","master, sourcing data and shift clock"
"what is the role of other 6526 devices in a common bus","slaves"
"why are CNT and SP outputs open drain","to allow a common bus"
"how can protocol for master/slave selection be transmitted","over the serial bus, or via dedicated handshaking lines"
