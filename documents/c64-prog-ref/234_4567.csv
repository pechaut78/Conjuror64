"what generates NMI requests for RS-232 processing?","the 6526 CIA #2 device timers and interrupts"
"what is the purpose of the built-in hold-offs in the KERNAL, cassette, and serial bus routines?","to prevent the disruption of data storage or transmission by the NMIs"
"can data be received from RS-232 devices during cassette or serial bus activities?","no"
"what is the purpose of the two buffers in the Commodore 64 RS-232 interface?","to help prevent the loss of data when transmitting or receiving RS-232 information"
"what is the size of each of the two FIFO buffers in the Commodore 64 RS-232 interface?","256 bytes"
"what happens when an RS-232 channel is OPENed?","512 bytes of memory are automatically allocated for the buffers"
"what happens if there is not enough free space beyond the end of your BASIC program when an RS-232 channel is OPENed?","no error message will be printed, and the end of your program will be destroyed"
"how are the buffers automatically removed?","by using the CLOSE command"
