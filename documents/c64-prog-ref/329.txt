 R/W  (Pin 7)

    This TTL-level input controls the direction of data transfers between
  SID and the microprocessor. If the chip select conditions have been met,
  a high on this line allows the microprocessor to Read data from the
  selected SID register and a low allows the microprocessor to Write data
  into the selected SID register. This pin is normally connected to the
  system Read/Write line.
