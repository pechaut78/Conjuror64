question,answer
"what is the function of bits 4-7 in register 05","these bits select 1 of 16 ATTACK rates for the Voice 1 Envelope Generator"
"what determines how rapidly the output of Voice 1 rises from zero to peak amplitude","the ATTACK rate"
"what cycle follows the ATTACK cycle","the DECAY cycle"
"what determines how rapidly the output falls from the peak amplitude to the selected SUSTAIN level","the DECAY rate"
"what are the 16 DECAY rates listed in","Table 2"
"what do bits 0-3 of register 06 select","1 of 16 SUSTAIN levels for the Envelope Generator"
"what happens when the Gate bit remains set","the output of Voice 1 will remain at the selected SUSTAIN amplitude"
"what do bits 0-3 of register 06 also select","1 of 16 RELEASE rates for the Envelope Generator"
"what cycle follows the SUSTAIN cycle when the Gate bit is reset to zero","the RELEASE cycle"
"what happens to the output of Voice 1 when the Gate bit is reset to zero","it will fall from the SUSTAIN amplitude to zero amplitude at the selected RELEASE rate"
"can the cycling of the Envelope Generator be altered at any point","yes, via the Gate bit"
"what technique can be used to generate complex amplitude envelopes","real-time software control"
"what is the ATTACK rate for a value of 0 (0) in Table 2","2 ms"
"what is the DECAY/RELEASE rate for a value of 0 (0) in Table 2","6 ms"
"what is the ATTACK rate for a value of 15 (F) in Table 2","8 s"
"what is the DECAY/RELEASE rate for a value of 15 (F) in Table 2","24 s"
"what is the function of registers 07-$0D","they control Voice 2 and are functionally identical to registers 00-06"
"what is the function of registers $0E-$14","they control Voice 3 and are functionally identical to registers 00-06"
"what happens when SYNC is selected in Voice 2","Oscillator 2 is synchronized with Oscillator 1"
"what happens when RING MOD is selected in Voice 2","the Triangle output of Oscillator 2 is replaced with the ring modulated combination of Oscillators 2 and 1"
