"how do I turn on multiple sprites at once?","You can turn on multiple sprites at once by adding together the numbers of the sprites you want to turn on. For example, POKE V+21, 6 turns on sprites 1 and 2. This method allows you to control multiple sprites simultaneously without affecting each other."
"what is the purpose of using POKE V+21 and a number?","The purpose of using POKE V+21 and a number is to turn on individual sprites. The number corresponds to the sprite you want to turn on, and using POKE V+21 with that number will activate the sprite. However, turning on just one sprite will turn off any others, so you need to add the numbers together to turn on multiple sprites."
"how do I turn off a single sprite without affecting others?","To turn off a single sprite without affecting others, you can use the following method: POKE V+21, PEEK V+21 AND (255-1), where 1 corresponds to sprite 0. You can change the number 1 to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 to turn off sprites 0-7 respectively."
"what is the difference between POKE V+21, PEEK V+21 AND (255-1) and POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21)OR 1?","The difference between POKE V+21, PEEK V+21 AND (255-1) and POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21)OR 1 is that the first command turns off a sprite, while the second command turns on a sprite. The first command uses the AND operator to mask out the bit corresponding to the sprite you want to turn off, while the second command uses the OR operator to set the bit corresponding to the sprite you want to turn on."
"can I use POKE V+21 to turn on and off sprites simultaneously?","No, you cannot use POKE V+21 to turn on and off sprites simultaneously. Turning on one sprite will turn off any others. To turn on multiple sprites, you need to add their numbers together. To turn off a sprite without affecting others, you need to use the method described above."
"what is the significance of the number 255 in the command POKE V+21, PEEK V+21 AND (255-1)?","The number 255 in the command POKE V+21, PEEK V+21 AND (255-1) is a binary number that represents all bits set to 1. Subtracting 1 from it will give you a binary number with all bits set to 1 except for the bit corresponding to the sprite you want to turn off. The AND operator is then used to mask out that bit, effectively turning off the sprite."
"how do I re-enable a sprite that I previously turned off?","To re-enable a sprite that you previously turned off, you can use the command POKE V+21, PEEK(V+21)OR 1, where 1 corresponds to sprite 0. You can change the number 1 to 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128 to re-enable sprites 0-7 respectively."
"what is the purpose of the V+21 address in the POKE command?","The purpose of the V+21 address in the POKE command is to access the sprite control register. This register controls the state of the sprites, and by using POKE to modify this register, you can turn on and off individual sprites."
"can I use this method to control sprites in a game or animation?","Yes, this method can be used to control sprites in a game or animation. By carefully using the POKE command to turn on and off individual sprites, you can create the illusion of movement and animation. This is especially useful in games where you need to control multiple sprites simultaneously."
"how does the method of turning on and off sprites affect other graphics on the screen?","The method of turning on and off sprites using POKE V+21 does not affect other graphics on the screen. It only controls the state of the sprites, and does not interfere with other graphical elements such as characters, backgrounds, or text."
