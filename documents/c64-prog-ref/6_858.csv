"what is the maximum amount of memory that the VIC-II chip can access at a time?","The VIC-II chip can access 16K of memory at a time, which is a limitation that requires bank selection to access the entire 64K of memory in the Commodore 64."
"How many banks of memory are there in the Commodore 64?","There are 4 possible banks of 16K memory in the Commodore 64, which can be accessed by controlling the bank select bits in the CIA#2 chip."
"What is the purpose of the bank select bits in the CIA#2 chip?","The bank select bits in the CIA#2 chip are used to control which 16K bank of memory the VIC-II chip looks at, allowing access to the entire 64K of memory."
"How are the bank select bits controlled?","The bank select bits are controlled using the POKE and PEEK BASIC statements (or their machine language versions) to set bits 0 and 1 of PORT A of CIA#2 (location 56576) and setting bits 0 and 1 of location 56578 ($DD02,HEX) to change banks."
"What is the default bank setting when the Commodore 64 is powered on?","When the Commodore 64 is powered on, bits 0 and 1 of location 56576 are automatically set to BANK 0 ($0000-$3FFF) for all display information."
"What is the significance of the bank concept in the VIC-II chip?","The 16K bank concept is crucial in the VIC-II chip, as it affects where character data patterns come from, where the screen is, where sprites come from, etc. and it's essential to be aware of which bank the VIC-II chip is pointing at."
"How do you set bits 0 and 1 of PORT A of CIA#2 to outputs?","You set bits 0 and 1 of PORT A of CIA#2 to outputs by setting bits 0 and 1 of location 56578 ($DD02,HEX) using the POKE statement, for example: POKE 56578,PEEK(56578)OR 3."
"What is the purpose of the POKE statement in the bank selection process?","The POKE statement is used to change banks by setting the bank select bits in the CIA#2 chip, for example: POKE 56576,(PEEK(56576)AND 252)OR A."
"In which banks is the Commodore 64 character set not available to the VIC-II chip?","The Commodore 64 character set is not available to the VIC-II chip in BANKS 1 and 3."
"How do you change banks using machine language?","You change banks using machine language by controlling bits 0 and 1 of PORT A of CIA#2 (location 56576) and setting bits 0 and 1 of location 56578 ($DD02,HEX) to outputs, similar to the POKE statement."
