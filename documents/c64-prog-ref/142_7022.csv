question,answer
"what is the opcode for LDA in immediate addressing mode?","The opcode for LDA in immediate addressing mode is A9, which loads the accumulator with the immediate value specified in the operand."
"What is the difference in the number of cycles between the zero page and absolute addressing modes for the LDA instruction?","The zero page addressing mode for the LDA instruction takes 3 cycles, while the absolute addressing mode takes 4 cycles, resulting in a difference of 1 cycle."
"How many bytes are required to encode the LDA instruction in absolute addressing mode?","The LDA instruction in absolute addressing mode requires 3 bytes, which include the opcode and the 2-byte absolute address."
"What is the purpose of the LDA instruction in the context of the C64?","The LDA instruction loads the accumulator with the value stored in memory at the specified address, which is essential for performing arithmetic and logical operations in the C64."
"What is the opcode for LDA in zero page addressing mode?","The opcode for LDA in zero page addressing mode is A5, which loads the accumulator with the value stored in the zero page address specified in the operand."
"How does the LDA instruction handle page boundaries in absolute addressing mode?","When the LDA instruction accesses memory across a page boundary in absolute addressing mode, it takes an additional cycle, resulting in a total of 5 cycles."
"What is the difference between the LDA instructions with X and Y indexing?","The LDA instruction with X indexing loads the accumulator with the value stored in memory at the address specified in the operand plus the value of the X register, whereas the LDA instruction with Y indexing loads the accumulator with the value stored in memory at the address specified in the operand plus the value of the Y register."
"What is the opcode for LDA in indirect addressing mode?","The opcode for LDA in indirect addressing mode is A1, which loads the accumulator with the value stored in memory at the address specified in the operand plus the value of the X register."
"How many cycles does the LDA instruction take in indirect addressing mode?","The LDA instruction in indirect addressing mode takes 6 cycles, which includes the time required to access the memory location specified in the operand."
"What is the purpose of the LDA instruction with Y indexing?","The LDA instruction with Y indexing loads the accumulator with the value stored in memory at the address specified in the operand plus the value of the Y register, which is useful for accessing data structures such as arrays and tables."
