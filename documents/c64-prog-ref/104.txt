  INDEXING

    Indexing plays an extremely important part in the running of the 6510
  microprocessor. It can be defined as "creating an actual address from a
  base address plus the contents of either the X or Y index registers."
    For example, if X contains $05, and the microprocessor executes an LDA
  instruction in the "absolute X indexed mode" with base address (e.g.,
  $9000), then the actual location that is loaded into the A register is
  $9000 + $05 = $9005. The mnemonic format of an absolute indexed
  instruction is the same as an absolute instruction except a ",X" or ",Y"
  denoting the index is added to the address.

  EXAMPLE:

    LDA $9000,X

    There are absolute indexed, zero page indexed, indirect indexed, and
  indexed indirect modes of addressing available on the 6510
  microprocessor.
