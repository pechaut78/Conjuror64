"What is the difference between STANDARD and MULTI-COLOR sprite modes?","In STANDARD mode, a '0' bit of sprite data allows background data to show through and a '1' bit is displayed as the sprite color, whereas in MULTI-COLOR mode, the sprite data is interpreted in pairs to display different colors."
"How does the MnMC bit affect the sprite display?","When the MnMC bit is '1', the corresponding sprite is displayed in the multi-color mode, where the sprite data is interpreted in pairs to display different colors."
"What is the resolution of a sprite in MULTI-COLOR mode?","In MULTI-COLOR mode, the resolution of the sprite is reduced to 12x21, with each horizontal dot expanded to twice the standard size so that the overall sprite size does not change."
"What is the purpose of the sprite Multi-color register 28 ($1C)?","The sprite Multi-color register 28 ($1C) is used to select each sprite as a multi-color sprite via the MnMC bits."
"How many colors can be displayed in a sprite in MULTI-COLOR mode?","Up to 3 colors can be displayed in each sprite in MULTI-COLOR mode, in addition to transparent, but two of the colors are shared among all the sprites in this mode."
"What is the significance of the '00' bit pair in MULTI-COLOR mode?","In MULTI-COLOR mode, the '00' bit pair represents transparent, allowing background data to show through."
"What is the significance of the '10' bit pair in MULTI-COLOR mode?","In MULTI-COLOR mode, the '10' bit pair represents the sprite Color, which is determined by the corresponding sprite Color register."
"What is the purpose of registers 39-46 ($27-$2E) in MULTI-COLOR mode?","Registers 39-46 ($27-$2E) are used to store the sprite Color, which is displayed when the '10' bit pair is encountered in MULTI-COLOR mode."
