question,answer
"what is the opcode for BMI branch instruction?","The opcode for BMI branch instruction is 30. This instruction is used to branch on the result of a comparison, and it is commonly used to implement conditional jumps in 6502 assembly language programming."
"what is the addressing mode used in BMI instruction?","The addressing mode used in BMI instruction is Relative. This means that the target address of the branch is specified as a relative offset from the current program counter."
"how many bytes does the BMI instruction occupy in memory?","The BMI instruction occupies 2 bytes in memory. This is because the opcode is 1 byte, and the relative offset is 1 byte."
"what is the minimum number of cycles required to execute the BMI instruction?","The minimum number of cycles required to execute the BMI instruction is 2. However, this can increase to 3 or 4 cycles depending on whether the branch occurs to the same page or a different page."
"what happens to the cycle count if the branch occurs to the same page?","If the branch occurs to the same page, the cycle count increases by 1, making it a total of 3 cycles."
"what happens to the cycle count if the branch occurs to a different page?","If the branch occurs to a different page, the cycle count increases by 1, making it a total of 3 cycles. This is because the CPU needs to perform a page boundary crossing, which takes an additional cycle."
"can you give an example of BMI instruction in assembly language?","Here is an example of BMI instruction in assembly language: BMI Oper. This instruction branches to the target address specified by the oper operand if the result of the previous comparison is minus."
"what is the purpose of the BMI instruction in 6502 assembly language programming?","The purpose of the BMI instruction is to branch on the result of a comparison, allowing the program to implement conditional jumps and make decisions based on the result of a comparison."
"how does the BMI instruction affect the program counter?","The BMI instruction affects the program counter by modifying it to point to the target address specified by the relative offset. This allows the program to jump to a different location in memory."
"what is the relationship between the BMI instruction and the comparison flags?","The BMI instruction is related to the comparison flags because it branches on the result of a comparison, which sets or clears the comparison flags. The BMI instruction tests the minus flag, which is set if the result of the comparison is minus."
