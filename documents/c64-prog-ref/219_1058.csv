"What is the easiest method to add machine language programs to a BASIC program?","The easiest method is by using DATA statements, where the machine language routine is stored as a series of numeric values in a DATA statement, and then POKEing those values into memory at the start of the program."
"How do you add a machine language routine to a BASIC program using the DATA statement method?","You use a READ statement to read the values from the DATA statement, and then use a POKE statement to store those values in memory, typically at the start of the program."
"What are the drawbacks of using the DATA statement method to add machine language routines to a BASIC program?","The drawbacks include taking up more memory space, and the wait while the program is POKED in, making it better suited for smaller routines."
"What is an example of a BASIC program that uses the DATA statement method to add a machine language routine?","An example is: 10 RESTORE:FOR X=1 TO 9:READ A:POKE 12*4096+X,A:NEXT, which reads values from a DATA statement and POKEs them into memory."
"How do you store a machine language routine in a DATA statement?","You store the machine language routine as a series of numeric values in a DATA statement, where each value represents a byte of machine code."
"What is the purpose of the RESTORE statement in the example program?","The RESTORE statement is used to reset the DATA pointer to the beginning of the DATA statement, so that the READ statement can read the values in the correct order."
"Why is the DATA statement method better suited for smaller machine language routines?","The DATA statement method is better suited for smaller machine language routines because it takes up more memory space, and larger routines would use too much memory."
"How do you POKE the values from the DATA statement into memory?","You use a POKE statement to store the values from the DATA statement into memory, typically at the start of the program, using an address calculation like 12*4096+X."
"What is the advantage of using the DATA statement method to add machine language routines to a BASIC program?","The advantage is that it is easy to debug, and no special methods are needed to save the two parts of the program."
"Why is the DATA statement method a common method for adding machine language programs to a BASIC program?","The DATA statement method is a common method because it is easy to use, and does not require any special tools or techniques, making it accessible to beginners."
