question,answer
"Does the 6510 require a specific clock signal?","Yes, it requires a two-phase non-overlapping clock that runs at the Vcc voltage level."
"What is the purpose of the Address Bus?","The Address Bus is used to transfer data to and from the device and peripherals."
"What is the capacity of the Address Bus?","The Address Bus can drive one standard TTL load and 130 pf."
"What is the purpose of the Data Bus?","The Data Bus is a Bi-Directional bus, transferring data to and from the device and peripherals."
"What is the capacity of the Data Bus?","The Data Bus can drive one standard TTL load and 130 pf."
"What is the purpose of the Reset signal?","The Reset signal is used to reset or start the microprocessor from a power down condition."
"What happens when the Reset signal is held low?","Writing to or from the microprocessor is inhibited."
"What happens when the Reset signal is held low for at least two clock cycles?","The mask interrupt flag will be set and the microprocessor will load the program counter from the memory vector locations FFFC and FFFD."
"What is the purpose of the Interrupt Request signal?","The Interrupt Request signal requests that an interrupt sequence begin within the microprocessor."
"What happens when an interrupt is requested?","The microprocessor will complete the current instruction being executed before recognizing the request."
"What is the purpose of the Address Enable Control signal?","The Address Enable Control signal allows easy DMA and multiprocessor systems."
"What is the purpose of the I/O Port?","The I/O Port is used to transfer data to or from peripheral devices."
"What is the capacity of the I/O Port?","The I/O Port can drive one standard TTL load and 130 pf."
"What is the purpose of the Read/Write signal?","The Read/Write signal is used to control the direction of data transfers on the Data Bus."
"What happens when the Read/Write signal is low?","The microprocessor is writing to memory or a peripheral device."
"What is the capacity of the Read/Write signal?","The Read/Write signal is high except when the microprocessor is writing to memory or a peripheral device."
"What is the purpose of the microprocessor's clock signal?","The clock signal is used to control the timing of the microprocessor's operations."
