question,answer
"what is the function of the data direction register in the 6526 i/o ports","The Data Direction Register (DDR) determines whether a bit in the Peripheral Data Register (PR) is an input or an output. If a bit in the DDR is set to a one, the corresponding bit in the PR is an output; if a DDR bit is set to a zero, the corresponding PR bit is defined as an input."
"what happens when a bit in the data direction register is set to a one","When a bit in the Data Direction Register (DDR) is set to a one, the corresponding bit in the Peripheral Data Register (PR) is defined as an output, allowing data to be written to the port pin."
"what is the purpose of the peripheral data register in the 6526 i/o ports","The Peripheral Data Register (PR) reflects the information present on the actual port pins (PA0-PA7, PB0-PB7) for both input and output bits, allowing data to be read from or written to the port pins."
"what is the difference between a bit set to a one and a bit set to a zero in the data direction register","A bit set to a one in the Data Direction Register (DDR) defines the corresponding bit in the Peripheral Data Register (PR) as an output, while a bit set to a zero defines the corresponding PR bit as an input."
"what type of compatibility do the ports a and b provide","Ports A and B provide both CMOS and TTL compatibility, thanks to the passive pull-up devices as well as active pull-ups."
"what is the load drive capability of ports a and b","Both ports A and B have two TTL load drive capability."
"what additional function do pb6 and pb7 provide","In addition to normal I/O operation, PB6 and PB7 also provide timer output functions."
"what is the purpose of the passive pull-up devices in ports a and b","The passive pull-up devices in Ports A and B provide CMOS and TTL compatibility."
"how do ports a and b reflect the information present on the actual port pins","Ports A and B reflect the information present on the actual port pins (PA0-PA7, PB0-PB7) for both input and output bits through the Peripheral Data Register (PR)."
"what is the relationship between the data direction register and the peripheral data register","The Data Direction Register (DDR) determines whether a bit in the Peripheral Data Register (PR) is an input or an output, and the PR reflects the information present on the actual port pins for both input and output bits."
