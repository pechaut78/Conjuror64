question,answer
"What is the opcode for the SBC instruction in immediate addressing mode?","The opcode for the SBC instruction in immediate addressing mode is E9, which requires 2 bytes and takes 2 cycles to execute."
"What is the difference in cycles between the SBC instruction in zero page and absolute addressing modes?","The SBC instruction in zero page addressing mode takes 3 cycles to execute, while in absolute addressing mode it takes 4 cycles, a difference of 1 cycle."
"How many bytes are required to execute the SBC instruction in absolute,X addressing mode?","The SBC instruction in absolute,X addressing mode requires 3 bytes and takes 4 cycles to execute, with an additional cycle added if a page boundary is crossed."
"What is the opcode for the SBC instruction in (indirect,X) addressing mode?","The opcode for the SBC instruction in (indirect,X) addressing mode is E1, which requires 2 bytes and takes 6 cycles to execute."
"What is the purpose of the SBC instruction in the context of the Commodore 64?","The SBC instruction subtracts the value in memory from the accumulator with borrow, which is useful for performing arithmetic operations and handling borrow flags."
"How does the SBC instruction handle page boundaries in absolute,X and absolute,Y addressing modes?","When the SBC instruction is used in absolute,X and absolute,Y addressing modes, an additional cycle is added to the execution time if a page boundary is crossed."
"What is the difference in opcode between the SBC instruction in zero page and zero page,X addressing modes?","The opcode for the SBC instruction in zero page addressing mode is E5, while in zero page,X addressing mode it is F5, a difference of 10 in hexadecimal."
"In what situations would you use the SBC instruction with the (indirect),Y addressing mode?","The SBC instruction with the (indirect),Y addressing mode is useful when the memory location is stored in a zero page location and the Y register contains the offset, allowing for flexible and efficient memory access."
"How does the SBC instruction interact with the borrow flag on the Commodore 64?","The SBC instruction sets the borrow flag if a borrow is required to perform the subtraction, and clears it otherwise, allowing for efficient handling of arithmetic operations."
"What is the primary advantage of using the SBC instruction in immediate addressing mode?","The primary advantage of using the SBC instruction in immediate addressing mode is that it allows for fast and efficient subtraction of a constant value from the accumulator, with a shorter opcode and fewer cycles required compared to other addressing modes."
