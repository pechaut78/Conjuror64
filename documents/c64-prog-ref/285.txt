  BIT MAP MODE

    In bit map mode, the 6566/6567 fetches data from memory in a different
  fashion, so that a one-to-one correspondence exists between each
  displayed dot and a memory bit. The bit map mode provides a screen
  resolution of 320H * 200V individually controlled display dots. Bit map
  mode is selected by setting the BMM bit in register 17 ($11) to a "1".
  The VIDEO MATRIX is still accessed as in character mode, but the video
  matrix data is no longer interpreted as character pointers, but rather as
  color data. The VIDEO MATRIX COUNTER is then also used as an address to
  fetch the dot data for display from the 8000-byte DISPLAY BASE. The
  display base address is formed as follows:


     A13| A12| A11| A10| A09| A08| A07| A06| A05| A04| A03| A02| A01| A00
    CB13| VC9| VC8| VC7| VC6| VC5| VC4| VC3| VC2| VC1| VC0| RC2| RC1| RC0
