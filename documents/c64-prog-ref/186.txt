  B-10. Function Name: CLRCHN

    Purpose: Clear I/O channels
    Call address: $FFCC (hex) 65484 (decimal)
    Communication registers: None
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns:
    Stack requirements: 9
    Registers affected: A, X

    Description: This routine is called to clear all open channels and re-
  store the I/O channels to their original default values. It is usually
  called after opening other I/O channels (like a tape or disk drive) and
  using them for input/output operations. The default input device is 0
  (keyboard). The default output device is 3 (the Commodore 64 screen).
    If one of the channels to be closed is to the serial port, an UNTALK
  signal is sent first to clear the input channel or an UNLISTEN is sent to
  clear the output channel. By not calling this routine (and leaving lis-
  tener(s) active on the serial bus) several devices can receive the same
  data from the Commodore 64 at the same time. One way to take advantage
  of this would be to command the printer to TALK and the disk to LISTEN.
  This would allow direct printing of a disk file.
    This routine is automatically called when the KERNAL CLALL routine is
  executed.

  How to Use:
    1) Call this routine using the JSR instruction.
