"what is the maximum number of colors that can be displayed in each 8 by 8 section of bit map in multi-color bit map mode?","up to four different colors can be displayed in each 8 by 8 section of bit map in multi-color bit map mode, which is similar to multi-color mode characters."
"How does the horizontal resolution change when using multi-color bit map mode?","the horizontal resolution is sacrificed, decreasing from 320 dots to 160 dots, similar to multi-character mode."
"What is the size of the memory section used for the bit map in multi-color bit map mode?","an 8K section of memory is used for the bit map in multi-color bit map mode."
"Where are the colors for multi-color bit map mode selected from?","the colors for multi-color bit map mode are selected from the background color register 0 (the screen background color), the video matrix (the upper 4 bits give one possible color, the lower 4 bits another), and color memory."
"How is multi-color bit mapped mode turned ON?","multi-color bit mapped mode is turned ON by setting bit 5 of 53265 ($D011) and bit 4 at location 53270 ($D016) to a 1, which can be done using the following POKE: POKE 53265,PEEK(53625)OR 32: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16."
"How is multi-color bit mapped mode turned OFF?","multi-color bit mapped mode is turned OFF by setting bit 5 of 53265 ($D011) and bit 4 at location 53270 ($D016) to a 0, which can be done using the following POKE: POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND 223: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND 239."
"What is the relationship between the 8K section of memory and what is shown on the screen in multi-color bit mapped mode?","there is a one to one correspondence between the 8K section of memory being used for the display and what is shown on the screen, similar to standard (HI-RES) bit mapped mode."
"How are the horizontal dots represented in the display memory area in multi-color bit mapped mode?","each 2 bits in the display memory area form a dot, which can have one of 4 colors."
"What is the significance of the video matrix in multi-color bit map mode?","the video matrix provides two possible colors, with the upper 4 bits giving one possible color and the lower 4 bits giving another."
"What is the purpose of the background color register 0 in multi-color bit map mode?","the background color register 0 provides one of the possible colors that can be used in multi-color bit map mode, which is the screen background color."
