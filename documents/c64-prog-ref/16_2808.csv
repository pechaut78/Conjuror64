"how do you turn on multi-color character mode on a commodore 64","To turn on multi-color character mode, set bit 4 of the VIC-II control register at 53270 ($D016) to a 1 by using the following POKE: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16. This will enable multi-color mode for the entire screen, allowing for more colorful graphics and characters."
"what is the purpose of bit 3 in color memory","Bit 3 in color memory determines whether a space on the screen is displayed in high-resolution mode or multi-color mode. If the number in color memory is less than 8 (0-7), the corresponding space on the video screen will be standard hi-res, in the color (0-7) chosen. If the number located in color memory is greater or equal to 8 (from 8 to 15), then that space will be displayed in multi-color mode."
"how do you turn off multi-color character mode on a commodore 64","To turn off multi-color character mode, set bit 4 of location 53270 to a 0 by using the following POKE: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND 239. This will disable multi-color mode for the entire screen, reverting back to standard high-resolution mode."
"what is the significance of the number in color memory","The number in color memory determines the display mode for a space on the screen. If the number is between 0 and 7, the space will be displayed in high-resolution mode with the corresponding color. If the number is between 8 and 15, the space will be displayed in multi-color mode, with the color determined by the lower 3 bits in color memory."
"what is the purpose of the VIC-II control register at 53270 ($D016)","The VIC-II control register at 53270 ($D016) is used to control the display mode of the Commodore 64. Bit 4 of this register determines whether multi-color character mode is enabled or disabled for the entire screen."
"how do you change the color of a character in multi-color mode","By POKEing a number into color memory, you can change the color of the character in that position on the screen. POKEing a number from 0 to 7 gives the normal character colors. POKEing a number between 8 and 15 puts the space into multi-color mode, with the color determined by the lower 3 bits in color memory."
"what is the difference between high-resolution mode and multi-color mode","In high-resolution mode, the screen color is displayed everywhere there is a 0 bit, and the character color is displayed where the bit is a 1. In multi-color mode, the bits in pairs determine the color, according to the following chart: BIT PAIR - COLOR REGISTER - LOCATION, 00 - Background #0 color (screen color) - 53281 ($D021), 01 - Background #1 color - 53282 ($D022), 10 - Background #2 color - 53283 ($D023), 11 - Color specified by the lower 3 bits in color memory - color RAM."
"what is the purpose of the color memory starting at location 55296 ($D800)","The color memory starting at location 55296 ($D800) is used to store the color information for each character on the screen. The number in color memory determines whether a space on the screen is displayed in high-resolution mode or multi-color mode, and also determines the color of the character in multi-color mode."
"how do you set a space on the screen to high-resolution mode","To set a space on the screen to high-resolution mode, POKE a number from 0 to 7 into the corresponding location in color memory. This will display the character in the chosen color in high-resolution mode."
"what is the significance of the bit pairs in multi-color mode","In multi-color mode, the bits in pairs determine the color, according to the following chart: BIT PAIR - COLOR REGISTER - LOCATION, 00 - Background #0 color (screen color) - 53281 ($D021), 01 - Background #1 color - 53282 ($D022), 10 - Background #2 color - 53283 ($D023), 11 - Color specified by the lower 3 bits in color memory - color RAM."
