"what is the opcode for STA in zero page addressing mode?","The opcode for STA in zero page addressing mode is 85, which requires 2 bytes and takes 3 cycles to execute."
"what is the difference between STA Oper and STA Oper,X in zero page addressing mode?","In zero page addressing mode, STA Oper uses the opcode 85 and takes 3 cycles, whereas STA Oper,X uses the opcode 95 and takes 4 cycles, with the X register being used as an offset to the zero page address."
"what is the opcode for STA in absolute addressing mode?","The opcode for STA in absolute addressing mode is 80, which requires 3 bytes and takes 4 cycles to execute."
"how does the STA instruction differ when using the Y register in absolute addressing mode?","When using the Y register in absolute addressing mode, the STA instruction uses the opcode 99, requires 3 bytes, and takes 5 cycles to execute, with the Y register being used as an offset to the absolute address."
"what is the opcode for STA in indirect,X addressing mode?","The opcode for STA in indirect,X addressing mode is 81, which requires 2 bytes and takes 6 cycles to execute, with the X register being used as an offset to the indirect address."
"what is the difference between STA (Oper,X) and STA (Oper),Y in indirect addressing mode?","In indirect addressing mode, STA (Oper,X) uses the opcode 81 and takes 6 cycles, whereas STA (Oper),Y uses the opcode 91 and also takes 6 cycles, with the X register being used as an offset to the indirect address in the former, and the Y register being used as an offset in the latter."
"what is the purpose of the STA instruction?","The STA instruction is used to store the value of the accumulator in a specified memory location, with the addressing mode determining the memory location being written to."
"can you provide an example of using STA in a program?","Here is an example of using STA in a program: `LDA #$05 ; load the value 5 into the accumulator STA $0200 ; store the accumulator value in memory location $0200`"
"what is the relationship between the STA instruction and the accumulator?","The STA instruction is used to store the value of the accumulator in a specified memory location, meaning that the accumulator's value is copied to the specified memory location."
"how does the STA instruction interact with the X and Y registers?","The STA instruction can use the X and Y registers as offsets to the specified memory location, allowing for more flexible and dynamic memory access, with the X register being used in indirect,X and zero page,X addressing modes, and the Y register being used in absolute,Y and indirect,Y addressing modes."
