 SPRITE PRIORITY:

    Priority means one sprite will appear to move "in front of" or "behind"
  another sprite on the display screen. Sprites with more priority always
  appear to move "in front of" or "on top of" sprites with less priority.
  The rule is that lower numbered sprites have priority over higher
  numbered sprites. Sprite 0 has priority over all other sprites. Sprite 7
  has no priority in relation to the other sprites. Sprite 1 has priority
  over sprites 2-7, etc. If you put two sprites in the some position, the
  sprite with the higher priority will appear IN FRONT OF the sprite with
  the lower priority. The sprite with lower priority will either be
  obscured, or will "show through" (from "behind") the sprite with higher
  priority.
