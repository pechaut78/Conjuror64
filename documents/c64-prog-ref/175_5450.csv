question,answer
"what is the benefit of using the KERNAL routines?","it is an unnecessary duplication of effort to write these routines over and over again, so easy access to the operating system helps speed machine language programming."
"what is the KERNAL?","the KERNAL is a jump table, a collection of JMP instructions to many operating system routines."
"what must you do before calling a KERNAL routine?","you must make all of the preparations that the routine demands."
"how do you call a KERNAL routine?","you must call the routine by means of the JSR instruction."
"what instruction must KERNAL routines end with?","KERNAL routines must end with an RTS instruction."
"what happens when a KERNAL routine has finished its task?","control is returned to your program at the instruction after the JSR."
"what may KERNAL routines return?","many of the KERNAL routines return error codes in the status word or the accumulator."
"why is it important to handle error returns properly?","good programming practice and the success of your machine language programs demand that you handle this properly."
"what are the three simple steps to using the KERNAL?","set up, call the routine, and error handling."
"what is the purpose of the FUNCTION NAME in describing KERNAL routines?","it is the name of the KERNAL routine."
"what is the purpose of the CALL ADDRESS in describing KERNAL routines?","it is the call address of the KERNAL routine, given in hexadecimal."
"what is the purpose of the COMMUNICATION REGISTERS in describing KERNAL routines?","registers listed under this heading are used to pass parameters to and from the KERNAL routines."
"what is the purpose of the PREPARATORY ROUTINES in describing KERNAL routines?","certain KERNAL routines require that data be set up before they can operate, the routines needed are listed here."
"what is the purpose of the ERROR RETURNS in describing KERNAL routines?","a return from a KERNAL routine with the CARRY set indicates that an error was encountered in processing, the accumulator will contain the number of the error."
"what is the purpose of the STACK REQUIREMENTS in describing KERNAL routines?","it is the actual number of stack bytes used by the KERNAL routine."
"what is the purpose of the REGISTERS AFFECTED in describing KERNAL routines?","all registers used by the KERNAL routine are listed here."
"what is the purpose of the DESCRIPTION in describing KERNAL routines?","a short tutorial on the function of the KERNAL routine is given here."
"why is it important to use the KERNAL routines?","it helps speed machine language programming."
"what is the result of not handling error returns properly?","the rest of your program might 'bomb'."
"what is the purpose of the JSR instruction?","it is used to call a KERNAL routine."
"what is the purpose of the RTS instruction?","it is used to end a KERNAL routine."
"what is the benefit of using the operating system routines?","it helps speed machine language programming."
"what is the purpose of the accumulator in KERNAL routines?","it is used to pass parameters to and from the KERNAL routines."
"what is the purpose of the status word in KERNAL routines?","it is used to return error codes."
"what is the purpose of the stack in KERNAL routines?","it is used to store data temporarily."
"what is the purpose of the registers in KERNAL routines?","they are used to pass parameters to and from the KERNAL routines."
"what is the purpose of the error codes in KERNAL routines?","they indicate that an error was encountered in processing."
"what is the purpose of the CARRY flag in KERNAL routines?","it is set if an error was encountered in processing."
"what is the purpose of the DECIMAL address in describing KERNAL routines?","it is the call address of the KERNAL routine, given in decimal."
