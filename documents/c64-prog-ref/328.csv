question,answer
"Is the master clock for SID referenced to this clock?","This TTL-Level input is the master clock for SID."
"What controls data transfers between SID and the microprocessor?","02 also controls data transfers between SID and the microprocessor."
"What is the nominal operating frequency of the system clock?","1.0 MHz."
"What is the purpose of pin 6 in the system?","This TTL-Level input is the master clock for SID."
"What is the function of pin 6 in data transfers?","Essentially, (02 acts as a high-active chip select as far as data transfers are concerned."
"What is the condition for data transfer between SID and the microprocessor?","Data can only be transferred when (02 is high."
"What is the typical connection of pin 6 in the system?","This pin is normally connected to the system clock."
"What is the frequency of the system clock?","1.0 MHz."
"What is the role of pin 6 in the system?","All oscillator frequencies and envelope rates are referenced to this clock."
