question,answer
"what is the capacity of cassette tapes for data storage","almost unlimited"
"what is the limitation of cassette tapes","time it takes to find information"
"how can a programmer minimize the time factor when working with tape storage","read entire cassette data file into RAM, process it, and re-write all data on tape"
"what is the limitation of reading data from cassette tapes","must read through all data to access specific information"
"what is an alternative to cassette tapes for larger data files","floppy disk"
"what is an advantage of using floppy disks over cassette tapes","can read data at any position on the disk"
"how does the PRINT# statement format data","like the PRINT statement, but with consideration for the INPUT# statement"
"what happens when the INPUT# statement tries to read formatted strings from a cassette tape","it discovers no data for subsequent variables and combines all variables into one"
"how can you avoid wasting space on a cassette tape when using the PRINT# statement","use a separator such as a comma or RETURN code between variables"
"what is the RETURN code in CHR$ format","CHR$(13)"
"how can you put a RETURN code between each item when using the PRINT# statement","set a variable to the RETURN CHR$ code or use a comma"
"what is the GET# statement used for","to pick data from the tape one character at a time"
"what happens when the GET# statement receives a CHR$(0) code","it receives an empty string, not a one character string with a code of 0"
"how can you avoid an ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR when using the ASC function with the GET# statement","modify the line to GET#1, A$: A=ASC(A$+CHR$(0))"
"what is the purpose of adding CHR$(0) to the end of a string when using the ASC function","as insurance against empty strings"
"what happens when you try to use the ASC function on an empty string","you get an ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR"
"what is the advantage of using a floppy disk for business applications","can read data at any position on the disk"
"what type of applications typically use floppy disks","business applications like ledgers and mailing lists"
"how does the PRINT# statement work with the INPUT# statement","formats data with consideration for the INPUT# statement"
"what is the purpose of the INPUT# statement","to read data from a cassette tape"
"what happens when you use commas to separate variables in a PRINT# statement","it adds blank spaces between items, wasting space on the tape"
"how can you sort, edit, and examine data on a cassette tape","read the entire cassette data file into RAM, process it, and re-write all data on the tape"
"what is the limitation of using cassette tapes for data storage","size of available RAM"
"what happens when your data file is larger than the available RAM","it's probably time to switch to using a floppy disk"
"what is the purpose of the R$ variable in the PRINT# statement","to set a separator, such as a comma, between variables"
"what is the format of a proper tape file","with separators, such as commas or RETURN codes, between variables"
