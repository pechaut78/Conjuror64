"what is the only register that can be used as an index in indirect indexed mode?","The Y register is the only register that can be used as an index in indirect indexed mode, which allows for flexible memory access and manipulation."
"in indirect indexed mode, where can the actual address be located?","The actual address can only be in zero page, which is a 256-byte region of memory that is quickly accessible by the CPU."
"what is the significance of the zero page address specified in the instruction in indirect indexed mode?","The zero page address specified in the instruction contains the low byte of the actual address, and the next byte to it contains the high-order byte, which together form the complete memory address."
"how is the actual address calculated in indirect indexed mode?","The actual address is calculated by combining the low-order byte from the zero page address, the high-order byte from the next byte, and the value of the Y register, which serves as an index to offset the base address."
"in the example, what are the contents of locations $02 and $03?","The contents of location $02 are $45, and the contents of location $03 are $1E, which together form the actual address $1E45, to which the Y register is added to access the desired memory location."
"what is the purpose of the instruction LDA ($02),Y in the example code?","The instruction LDA ($02),Y loads the accumulator with the value stored at the memory location calculated by adding the value of the Y register to the base address stored in locations $02 and $03, which is $1E45 in this case."
"how does the analogy of delivering a letter to a post office illustrate indirect indexed mode?","The analogy illustrates how the CPU uses the zero page address as a 'post office' to retrieve the actual address, which is then offset by the value of the Y register, similar to how the letter is delivered to a specific house number past a base address on a street."
"what is the significance of the instruction LDY #$05 in the example code?","The instruction LDY #$05 sets the value of the Y register to $05, which is used as an index to offset the base address stored in locations $02 and $03, allowing the CPU to access a specific memory location."
"in indirect indexed mode, what is the role of the zero page address specified in the instruction?","The zero page address specified in the instruction serves as a 'pointer' to the actual address, which is stored in two consecutive bytes, with the low-order byte stored at the specified address and the high-order byte stored at the next address."
"what is the advantage of using indirect indexed mode in programming?","The advantage of using indirect indexed mode is that it allows for flexible and efficient memory access and manipulation, enabling the CPU to access a wide range of memory locations using a single instruction, which can improve the performance and efficiency of the program."
