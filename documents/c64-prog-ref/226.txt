  OUTPUT TO MODEM

    The modem is a simple device that can translate character codes into
  audio pulses and vice-versa, so that computers can communicate over
  telephone lines. The OPEN statement for the modem sets up the parameters
  to match the speed and format of the other computer you are communicating
  with. Two characters can be sent in the string at the end
  of the OPEN statement.
    The bit positions of the first character code determine the baud rate,
  number of data bits, and number of stop bits. The second code is op-
  tional, and its bits specify the parity and duplex of the transmission.
  See the RS-232 section or your VICMODEM manual for specific details on
  this device.

  EXAMPLE of OPEN Statement for Modem:

    OPEN 1,2,0,CHR$(6): REM 300 BAUD
    100 OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(163) CHR$(112): REM 110 BAUD, ETC.

    Most computers use the American Standard Code for Information In-
  terchange, known as ASCII (pronounced ASK-KEY). This standard set of
  character codes is somewhat different from the codes used in the Com-
  modore 64. When communicating with other computers, the Commodore
  character codes must be translated into their ASCII counterparts. A table
  of standard ASCII codes is included in this book in Appendix C.
    Output to the modem is a fairly uncomplicated task, aside from the need
  for character translation. However, you must know the receiving device
  fairly well, especially when writing programs where your computer "talks"
  to another computer without human intervention. An example of this would
  be a terminal program that automatically types in your account number and
  secret password. To do this successfully, you must carefully count the
  number of characters and RETURN characters. Otherwise, the computer
  receiving the characters won't know what to do with them.
