question,answer
"what is accumulator addressing","This form of addressing is represented with a one byte instruction, implying an operation on the accumulator."
"what is immediate addressing","In immediate addressing, the operand is contained in the second byte of the instruction, with no further memory addressing required."
"what is absolute addressing","In absolute addressing, the second byte of the instruction specifies the eight low order bits of the effective address while the third byte specifies the eight high order bits."
"what is zero page addressing","The zero page instructions allow for shorter code and execution times by only fetching the second byte of the instruction and assuming a zero high address byte."
"what is indexed zero page addressing","This form of addressing is used in conjunction with the index register and is referred to as Zero Page, X or Zero Page, Y."
"what is indexed absolute addressing","This form of addressing is used in conjunction with X and Y index register and is referred to as Absolute, X, and Absolute, Y."
"what is implied addressing","In the implied addressing mode, the address containing the operand is implicitly stated in the operation code of the instruction."
"what is relative addressing","Relative addressing is used only with branch instructions and establishes a destination for the conditional branch."
"what is indexed indirect addressing","In indexed indirect addressing, the second byte of the instruction is added to the contents of the X index register, discarding the carry."
"what is indirect indexed addressing","In indirect indexed addressing, the second byte of the instruction points to a memory location in page zero."
"what is absolute indirect addressing","The second byte of the instruction contains the low order eight bits of a memory location."
"what is the advantage of zero page addressing","Careful use of the zero page can result in significant increase in code efficiency."
"in what mode does the operand is contained in the second byte of the instruction","Immediate addressing"
"in what mode the address is implicitly stated in the operation code of the instruction","Implied addressing"
"in what mode the second byte of the instruction specifies the eight low order bits of the effective address","Absolute addressing"
"in what mode the second byte of the instruction points to a memory location in page zero","Indirect indexed addressing"
"in what mode the second byte of the instruction is added to the contents of the X index register","Indexed indirect addressing"
"what is the range of the offset in relative addressing","-128 to +127 bytes from the next instruction"
"what is the effective address formed by in indexed absolute addressing","adding the contents of X and Y to the address contained in the second and third bytes of the instruction"
"what is the effective address formed by in indexed indirect addressing","the result of the addition points to a memory location on page zero whose contents is the low order eight bits of the effective address"
"what is the effective address formed by in indirect indexed addressing","the contents of this memory location is added to the contents of the Y index register, the result being the low order eight bits of the effective address"
"what is the effective address formed by in absolute indirect addressing","the contents of the fully specified memory location is the low order byte of the effective address"
"what is the advantage of indexed absolute addressing","allows the index register to contain the index or count value and the instruction to contain the base address"
"what is the advantage of indexed zero page addressing","allows for shorter code and execution times"
"in what mode the high order eight bits of the effective address is contained in the third byte of the instruction","Absolute addressing"
"in what mode the high order eight bits of the effective address is contained in the next page zero memory location","Indexed indirect addressing"
"in what mode the high order eight bits of the effective address is contained in the next memory location","Indirect indexed addressing"
"in what mode the high order eight bits of the effective address is contained in the next memory location","Absolute indirect addressing"
"what is the purpose of indexed absolute addressing","allows any location referencing and the index to modify multiple fields resulting in reduced coding and execution time"
