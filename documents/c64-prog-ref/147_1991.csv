"what is the opcode for the ORA instruction in immediate addressing mode?","The opcode for the ORA instruction in immediate addressing mode is 09, which is used in the assembly language form ORA #Oper, and it takes 2 bytes and 2 cycles to execute."
"how many cycles does the ORA instruction take in zero page addressing mode?","The ORA instruction in zero page addressing mode takes 3 cycles to execute, and it has an opcode of 05, with an assembly language form of ORA Oper, and it takes 2 bytes."
"what is the difference in cycles between the ORA instruction in zero page and absolute addressing modes?","The ORA instruction in zero page addressing mode takes 3 cycles to execute, while in absolute addressing mode it takes 4 cycles to execute, with an opcode of 0D, and an assembly language form of ORA Oper, and it takes 3 bytes."
"how does the ORA instruction behave when the page is crossed in absolute,X addressing mode?","When the page is crossed in absolute,X addressing mode, the ORA instruction takes an additional cycle to execute, making it take 5 cycles in total, with an opcode of 10, and an assembly language form of ORA Oper,X, and it takes 3 bytes."
"what is the purpose of the ORA instruction in the context of bitwise operations?","The ORA instruction performs a bitwise OR operation between the accumulator and the memory location specified by the operand, setting the flags accordingly, and it is commonly used to set bits in a memory location or to test the state of bits in a memory location."
"what is the difference between the ORA instruction and the AND instruction?","The ORA instruction performs a bitwise OR operation, whereas the AND instruction performs a bitwise AND operation, the ORA instruction sets the flags based on the result of the OR operation, whereas the AND instruction sets the flags based on the result of the AND operation."
"how does the ORA instruction affect the flags in the processor status register?","The ORA instruction affects the flags in the processor status register by setting the N flag if the result of the OR operation is negative, setting the Z flag if the result is zero, and setting the V flag if an overflow occurs."
"what is the purpose of the ORA instruction in the context of input/output operations?","The ORA instruction can be used to read the state of input devices or to set the state of output devices, by performing a bitwise OR operation between the accumulator and the memory location specified by the operand."
"how does the ORA instruction interact with the X and Y registers?","The ORA instruction can use the X and Y registers as indices to access memory locations, allowing for more flexible and dynamic memory access, and enabling the use of tables and arrays in programming."
"what is the advantage of using the ORA instruction with indexed addressing modes?","The advantage of using the ORA instruction with indexed addressing modes is that it allows for more flexible and dynamic memory access, enabling the use of tables and arrays in programming, and making it easier to write efficient and compact code."
