question,answer
"what is the function of the raster register","The raster register is a dual-function register."
"what is the purpose of reading the raster register 18","A read of the raster register 18 returns the lower 8 bits of the current raster position"
"what is the location of the MSB-RC8","The MSB-RC8 is located in register 17 ($11)"
"what is the purpose of interrogating the raster register","The raster register can be interrogated to implement display changes outside the visible area to prevent display flicker"
"what is the range of the visible display window","The visible display window is from raster 51 through raster 251 ($033-$0FB)"
"what happens when the current raster matches the written value","When the current raster matches the written value, the raster interrupt latch is set"
"what is the purpose of writing to the raster bits","A write to the raster bits (including RC8) is latched for use in an internal raster compare"
"what is the purpose of the internal raster compare","The internal raster compare is used to compare the current raster with the written value"
"what is the purpose of the raster interrupt latch","The raster interrupt latch is set when the current raster matches the written value"
"what is the purpose of the internal raster compare latch","The internal raster compare latch is used to latch the written value for comparison with the current raster"
