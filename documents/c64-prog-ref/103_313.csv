"what happens when a GOSUB statement is encountered by the BASIC interpreter","The BASIC interpreter pushes its current position onto the stack before going to do the subroutine, and when a RETURN is executed, the interpreter pulls off the stack the information that tells it where it was before the subroutine call was made."
"in which memory page is the stack located","The stack is located in page one of memory."
"how long is the stack in bytes","The stack is 256 bytes long."
"in which direction is the stack organized in memory","The stack is organized backwards in memory."
"what is the function of the stack pointer","The stack pointer always points to the next available location in the stack."
"what happens to the stack pointer when something is pushed onto the stack","When something is pushed onto the stack, it is placed where the stack pointer points to, and the stack pointer is moved down to the next position (decremented)."
"what happens to the stack pointer when something is pulled off the stack","When something is pulled off the stack, the stack pointer is incremented, and the byte pointed to by the stack pointer is placed into the specified register."
"what is the implied mode in the context of instructions","The implied mode means that information is implied by an instruction itself, referring to what registers, flags, and memory the instruction is referring to."
"what is the function of the PHA instruction","The PHA instruction pushes the contents of the accumulator onto the stack."
"what is the function of the PLA instruction","The PLA instruction pulls a value off the stack and into the accumulator."
"what is the function of the PHP instruction","The PHP instruction pushes the status register onto the stack."
"what is the function of the PLP instruction","The PLP instruction pulls the status register from the stack."
"what is the starting address of the stack","The stack starts at address $01 00."
"what is the ending address of the stack","The stack ends at address $01 FF."
"what is the location of the first position in the stack","The first position in the stack is at $01 FF."
