  COLOR MEMORY

    Color memory can NOT move. It is always located at locations 55296
  ($D800) through 56295 ($DBE7). Screen memory (the 1000 locations starting
  at 1024) and color memory are used differently in the different graphics
  modes. A picture created in one mode will often look completely different
  when displayed in another graphics mode.
