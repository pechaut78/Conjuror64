"what is the opcode for decrement memory by one in zero page addressing mode?","The opcode for decrement memory by one in zero page addressing mode is C6, which requires 2 bytes and takes 5 cycles to execute."
"what is the assembly language form for decrement memory by one in zero page,X addressing mode?","The assembly language form for decrement memory by one in zero page,X addressing mode is DEC Oper,X, which has an opcode of D6, requires 2 bytes, and takes 6 cycles to execute."
"what is the opcode for decrement memory by one in absolute addressing mode?","The opcode for decrement memory by one in absolute addressing mode is CE, which requires 3 bytes and takes 6 cycles to execute."
"what is the assembly language form for decrement memory by one in absolute,X addressing mode?","The assembly language form for decrement memory by one in absolute,X addressing mode is DEC Oper,X, which has an opcode of DE, requires 3 bytes, and takes 7 cycles to execute."
"what is the difference in the number of bytes required between zero page and absolute addressing modes for the DEC instruction?","The zero page addressing mode requires 2 bytes, while the absolute addressing mode requires 3 bytes, making the absolute addressing mode require 1 more byte than the zero page addressing mode."
"how many cycles does it take to execute the DEC instruction in zero page addressing mode?","It takes 5 cycles to execute the DEC instruction in zero page addressing mode."
"what is the opcode for the DEC instruction in zero page,X addressing mode?","The opcode for the DEC instruction in zero page,X addressing mode is D6."
"in which addressing modes can the DEC instruction be used?","The DEC instruction can be used in zero page, zero page,X, absolute, and absolute,X addressing modes."
"what is the difference in the number of cycles required between the DEC instruction in zero page and absolute addressing modes?","The DEC instruction in zero page addressing mode requires 5 cycles, while in absolute addressing mode it requires 6 cycles, making the absolute addressing mode require 1 more cycle than the zero page addressing mode."
"what is the assembly language form for the DEC instruction in absolute addressing mode?","The assembly language form for the DEC instruction in absolute addressing mode is DEC Oper, which has an opcode of CE, requires 3 bytes, and takes 6 cycles to execute."
