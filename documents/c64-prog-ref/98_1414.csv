"what is the main limitation of writing machine language programs on a Commodore 64?","The main limitation of writing machine language programs on a Commodore 64 is that there is no facility in the computer for writing and editing machine language programs, requiring the use of a program or a BASIC program to facilitate the process."
"what is the purpose of an assembler in machine language programming?","The purpose of an assembler in machine language programming is to allow the writing of machine language instructions in a standardized mnemonic format, making the program more readable than a stream of numbers."
"what is a disassembler in machine language programming?","A disassembler in machine language programming is a program that displays a machine language program in mnemonic format, allowing for easier understanding and analysis of the program."
"what is the advantage of using an assembler in machine language programming?","The advantage of using an assembler in machine language programming is that it makes the machine language program more readable, as it allows the programmer to write machine language instructions in a standardized mnemonic format rather than a stream of numbers."
"what is the difference between an assembler and a disassembler?","The difference between an assembler and a disassembler is that an assembler is a program that allows you to write machine language programs in mnemonic format, while a disassembler is a program that displays a machine language program in mnemonic format."
"what is the name of the cartridge available for Commodore 64 that provides an assembler and disassembler?","The name of the cartridge available for Commodore 64 that provides an assembler and disassembler is the machine language monitor cartridge made by Commodore."
"why is it necessary to use a program or BASIC program to write machine language programs on a Commodore 64?","It is necessary to use a program or BASIC program to write machine language programs on a Commodore 64 because the computer does not have a built-in facility for writing and editing machine language programs."
"what is the benefit of using a machine language monitor cartridge on a Commodore 64?","The benefit of using a machine language monitor cartridge on a Commodore 64 is that it provides an assembler and disassembler, allowing for easier development and analysis of machine language programs."
"what is the format of machine language instructions when written using an assembler?","The format of machine language instructions when written using an assembler is a standardized mnemonic format, making the program more readable than a stream of numbers."
"what is the purpose of a machine language monitor cartridge on a Commodore 64?","The purpose of a machine language monitor cartridge on a Commodore 64 is to provide a facility for writing, editing, and analyzing machine language programs, including an assembler and disassembler."
