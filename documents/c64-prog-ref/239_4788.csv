question,answer
"Where is the Receiver Buffer base location pointer stored?","The Receiver Buffer base location pointer is stored at $00F7, which is a two-byte pointer set up by the OPEN KERNAL routine, pointing to a 256-byte buffer."
"What is the purpose of the CLOSE KERNAL entry?","The CLOSE KERNAL entry is used to de-allocate the Receiver and Transmitter Buffers by writing a zero into the high order bytes ($00F8 and $00FA) of the buffer base location pointers."
"How can a machine language programmer allocate/de-allocate the buffers?","A machine language programmer can allocate/de-allocate the buffers by writing a non-zero value to the high order bytes ($00F8 and $00FA) of the buffer base location pointers, and de-allocate by writing a zero to the same locations."
"What is the importance of maintaining correct top of memory pointers?","Maintaining correct top of memory pointers is crucial, especially when running BASIC programs concurrently, to prevent memory conflicts and ensure smooth program execution."
"What is the size of the buffers allocated by the OPEN KERNAL routine?","The buffers allocated by the OPEN KERNAL routine are 256-byte buffers."
"What is the purpose of the ROBUF pointer?","The ROBUF pointer, stored at $00F9, is a two-byte pointer to the Transmitter Buffer base location, set up by the OPEN KERNAL routine."
"How can a machine language programmer use the buffer pointers?","A machine language programmer can use the buffer pointers to allocate/de-allocate the buffers for their own purposes, removing/creating only the buffer(s) required, while taking care to maintain correct top of memory pointers."
"What happens when a zero is written to the high order bytes of the buffer base location pointers?","When a zero is written to the high order bytes ($00F8 and $00FA) of the buffer base location pointers, the buffers are de-allocated."
"What is the role of the OPEN KERNAL routine in setting up the buffer pointers?","The OPEN KERNAL routine sets up the buffer pointers, REBUF and ROBUF, to point to different 256-byte buffers."
"What precautions should a machine language programmer take when allocating/de-allocating buffers?","A machine language programmer should take care to maintain correct top of memory pointers, especially when running BASIC programs concurrently, to prevent memory conflicts and ensure smooth program execution."
