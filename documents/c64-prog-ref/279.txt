  6256 CONTROL REGISTERS

    There are two control registers in the 6526, CRA and CRB. CRA is
  associated with TIMER A and CRB is associated with TIMER B. The register
  format is as follows:

  CRA:
  Bit  Name    Function
   0  START    1=START TIMER A, 0=STOP TIMER A. This bit is automatically
               reset when underflow occurs during one-shot mode.
   1  PBON     1=TIMER A output appears on PB6, 0=PB6 normal operation.

   2  OUTMODE  1=TOGGLE, 0=PULSE
   3  RUNMODE  1=ONE-SHOT, 0=CONTINUOUS
   4  LOAD     1=FORCE LOAD (this is a STROBE input, there is no data
               storage, bit 4 will always read back a zero and writing a
               zero has no effect).
   5  INMODE   1=TIMER A counts positive CNT transitions, 0=TIMER A counts
               02 pulses.
   6  SPMODE   1=SERIAL PORT output (CNT sources shift clock),
               0=SERIAL PORT input (external shift clock required).
   7  TODIN    1=50 Hz clock required on TOD pin for accurate time,
               0=60 Hz clock required on TOD pin for accurate time.
  CRB:
  Bit  Name    Function
               (Bits CRB0-CRB4 are identical to CRA0-CRA4 for TIMER B with
               the exception that bit 1 controls the output of TIMER B on
               PB7).
  5,6 INMODE   Bits CRB5 and CRB6 select one of four input modes for
               TIMER B as:
               CRB6   CRB5
                0      0       TIMER B counts 02 pulses.
                0      1       TIMER B counts positive CNT transistions.
                1      0       TIMER B counts TIMER A underflow pulses.
                1      1       TIMER B counts TIMER A underflow pulses
                               while CNT is high.
  7   ALARM     1=writing to TOD registers sets ALARM, 0=writing to TOD
                registers sets TOD clock.

  

  All unused register bits are unaffected by a write and are forced to zero
  on a read.
