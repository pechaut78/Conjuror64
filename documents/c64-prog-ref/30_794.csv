"Where is the sprite definition block located if sprite pointer #0 at location 2040 contains the number 14?","The sprite definition block is located at location 896, which is in the cassette buffer, calculated using the formula LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE POINTER VALUE * 64), where BANK is the 16K segment of memory that the VIC-II chip is looking at and is from 0 to 3."
"What is the formula to calculate the start of the 64 bytes of the sprite definition block?","The formula is LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE POINTER VALUE * 64), where BANK is the 16K segment of memory that the VIC-II chip is looking at and is from 0 to 3, and SPRITE POINTER VALUE is the value stored in the sprite pointer."
"Why can't sprite definitions be placed in BANK 0 or BANK 2?","Because in BANK 0 or BANK 2, there is a ROM IMAGE of the character set present in certain locations, and sprite definitions cannot be placed there."
"What should you do if you need more than 128 different sprite definitions?","You should use one of the banks without the ROM IMAGE, which are BANK 1 or BANK 3, to place your sprite definitions."
"What is the purpose of the sprite pointer value?","The sprite pointer value is used to calculate the location of the sprite definition block, which is a 64-byte block that defines the sprite."
"What is the significance of the number 14 in the sprite pointer #0 at location 2040?","The number 14 is the sprite pointer value, which is used to calculate the location of the sprite definition block, which is 896 in this case."
"How many bytes are in a sprite definition block?","A sprite definition block is 64 bytes long."
"What is the range of values for the BANK in the formula LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE POINTER VALUE * 64)?","The range of values for the BANK is from 0 to 3."
"What is the purpose of the formula LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE POINTER VALUE * 64)?","The formula is used to calculate the start of the 64 bytes of the sprite definition block."
"In which banks can sprite definitions be placed?","Sprite definitions can be placed in BANK 1 or BANK 3, which do not have a ROM IMAGE of the character set."
