question,answer
"What is the maximum number of characters that the Commodore 64 receiver buffer can hold?","255 characters"
"What happens when the receiver buffer overflows?","All characters received during a full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost."
"Why is it important to keep the buffer as clear as possible?","To avoid losing characters received during a full buffer condition."
"What is recommended for receiving RS-232 data at high speeds?","Using machine language routines to handle data bursts."
"What is the recommended BASIC syntax for receiving RS-232 data?","GET#lfn, <string variable>"
"What is NOT recommended for receiving RS-232 data?","INPUT#lfn <variable list>"
"What is the purpose of the CHKIN kernal entry?","To handle the x-line handshake which follows the EIA standard for RS-232-C interfaces."
"What is the purpose of the GETIN kernal entry?","To get input from the RS-232 channel."
"What is the purpose of the CHRIN kernal entry?","To get a character from the RS-232 channel."
"What happens if the word length is less than 8 bits?","All unused bit(s) will be assigned a value of zero."
"What is returned if a GET# does not find any data in the buffer?","A null character."
"What happens if INPUT# is used and no data is received?","The system will hang in a waiting condition until a non-null character and a following carriage return is received."
"Why are INPUT# and CHRIN routines NOT recommended?","Because they can cause the system to hang in a RESTORE-only state if the CTS or DSR lines disappear during character input."
"What is the purpose of the RTS line in the RS-232-C interface?","To implement the x-line handshake."
"What is the purpose of the CTS line in the RS-232-C interface?","To implement the x-line handshake."
"What is the purpose of the DCD line in the RS-232-C interface?","To implement the x-line handshake."
"What is the EIA standard for RS-232-C interfaces?","A standard for RS-232-C interfaces published in August 1979."
"What is the Commodore 64 computer defined as in the RS-232-C interface?","A Data Terminal device."
"What is the purpose of the RS-232 status word?","To indicate the status of the RS-232 channel."
"What is the RS-232 status word referred to in BASIC?","ST"
"What is the RS-232 status word referred to in machine language?","RSSTAT"
"What happens if the receiver buffer overflows during high-speed data transfer?","All characters received during a full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost."
"Why is it important to use machine language routines for high-speed data transfer?","Because BASIC can only go so fast, especially considering garbage collects."
"What is the purpose of garbage collects in BASIC?","To free up memory and improve performance."
"Why can't BASIC handle high-speed data transfer?","Because it can only go so fast, especially considering garbage collects."
"What is the recommended way to receive RS-232 data in BASIC?","Using the GET# statement."
"What is the purpose of the GET# statement?","To get a string of characters from the RS-232 channel."
"What is the purpose of the INPUT# statement?","To get a list of variables from the RS-232 channel."
"Why is the INPUT# statement NOT recommended?","Because it can cause the system to hang in a RESTORE-only state if the CTS or DSR lines disappear during character input."
