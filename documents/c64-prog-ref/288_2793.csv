"How does the multi-color bit map mode differ from the standard bit map mode?","Multi-color bit map mode differs from standard bit map mode in the way it interprets the dot data, using the same memory access sequences but with a different interpretation of the bit pairs, allowing for the display of three independently selected colors in each 8*8 block in addition to the background color."
"What is the purpose of the MCM bit in register 22?","The MCM bit in register 22 is used to select the multi-color bit map mode when set to a '1' in conjunction with the BMM bit, enabling the use of multi-color mode."
"What is the significance of the bit pair '00' in multi-color bit map mode?","In multi-color bit map mode, the bit pair '00' represents the background color #0, which is set in register 33 ($21)."
"How is the video matrix pointer used in multi-color bit map mode?","The video matrix pointer is used in multi-color bit map mode, with the upper nybble of the pointer represented by the bit pair '01' and the lower nybble represented by the bit pair '10'."
"What is the resolution of the screen in multi-color bit map mode?","The screen resolution in multi-color bit map mode is 160H*200V, due to the horizontal dot size being doubled as a result of using two bits to select one dot color."
"How many colors can be displayed in each 8*8 block in multi-color bit map mode?","In multi-color bit map mode, three independently selected colors can be displayed in each 8*8 block, in addition to the background color."
"What is the role of the color nybble (DB11-DB8) in multi-color bit map mode?","The color nybble (DB11-DB8) is used in multi-color bit map mode to select the color of each dot, allowing for the display of multiple colors in each 8*8 block."
"What is the advantage of using multi-color bit map mode?","The advantage of using multi-color bit map mode is that it allows for the display of multiple colors in each 8*8 block, providing more color flexibility and detail in graphics and images."
"How is the background color set in multi-color bit map mode?","The background color is set in register 33 ($21) in multi-color bit map mode, and is represented by the bit pair '00'."
"What is the relationship between the BMM bit and the MCM bit in register 22?","The BMM bit and the MCM bit in register 22 must both be set to '1' to enable multi-color bit map mode, allowing for the display of multiple colors in each 8*8 block."
