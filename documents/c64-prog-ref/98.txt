  HOW DO YOU WRITE MACHINE LANGUAGE PROGRAMS?

    Since machine language programs reside in memory, and there is no
  facility in your Commodore 64 for writing and editing machine language
  programs, you must use either a program to do this, or write for yourself
  a BASIC program that "allows" you to write machine language.
    The most common methods used to write machine language programs are
  assembler programs. These packages allow you to write machine language
  instructions in a standardized mnemonic format, which makes the machine
  language program a lot more readable than a stream of numbers! Let's
  review: A program that allows you to write machine language programs in
  mnemonic format is called an assembler. Incidentally, a program that
  displays a machine language program in mnemonic format is called a
  disassembler. Available for your Commodore 64 is a machine language
  monitor cartridge (with assembler/disassembler, etc.) made by Commodore:
