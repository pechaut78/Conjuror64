"what is the maximum number of possible positions a sprite can have in the horizontal direction?","A sprite can have 512 possible positions in the left/right, X direction, which is achieved by adding an extra bit to control the X position, allowing for more possible combinations than can be seen on the visible part of the screen."
"How does the X MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT POSITION register affect the X position of a sprite?","The X MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT POSITION register must be set to 1 (turned ON) if the X position of a sprite is greater than 255 (on the right side of the screen), and set to 0 (turned OFF) if the X position of a sprite is less than 256 (on the left side of the screen)."
"What is the range of X positions that are visible on the screen?","The X positions that are visible on the screen range from 24 to 343, which is a subset of the total 512 possible positions."
"What is the purpose of the extra bit used to control the X position of a sprite?","The extra bit is used to control the X position of a sprite, allowing for 512 possible positions in the horizontal direction, which is necessary because there are more than 256 positions in the horizontal direction."
"How do the bits in the X MSB register correspond to sprites?","Bits 0 to 7 of the X MSB register correspond to sprites 0 to 7, respectively, which allows for the control of the X position of each sprite."
"What happens when the X position of a sprite is greater than 255?","When the X position of a sprite is greater than 255, the bit in the X MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT POSITION register must be set to 1 (turned ON)."
"What is the significance of the X MSB register in controlling the X position of a sprite?","The X MSB register plays a crucial role in controlling the X position of a sprite, as it determines whether the sprite is on the left or right side of the screen, and allows for the correct positioning of the sprite."
"How does the horizontal positioning of a sprite differ from the vertical positioning?","The horizontal positioning of a sprite is more complicated than the vertical positioning because it requires an extra bit to control the X position, allowing for 512 possible positions, whereas the vertical positioning only requires 256 possible positions."
"What is the range of values that a sprite's X position can take?","A sprite's X position can take values from 0 to 511, although only values between 24 and 343 are visible on the screen."
"In what way does the X MSB register affect the visibility of a sprite on the screen?","The X MSB register affects the visibility of a sprite on the screen by determining whether the sprite is on the left or right side of the screen, and thus whether it is visible or not."
