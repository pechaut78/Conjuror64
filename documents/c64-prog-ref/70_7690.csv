"what is the recommended approach for setting sprite pointers in RAM memory?","It is recommended to set sprite pointers at a higher area of memory, such as 2040,192 for sprite 0 at locations 12288 to 12350, to protect sprite data from being overwritten by a long BASIC program."
"how can you define multiple sprites with different shapes?","You can define multiple sprites with different shapes by defining several sprite 'shapes' in your DATA statements and then redefining a particular sprite by changing the 'pointer' to point to different areas of memory containing different sprite picture data."
"what is the purpose of adjusting the memory locations of sprite pointers?","The purpose of adjusting the memory locations of sprite pointers is to define as many as 64 different sprites plus a sizable BASIC program, by changing the memory locations from which sprites get their 'data'."
"how can you make two or more sprites have the same shape?","You can make two or more sprites have the same shape by using the same sprite pointer and memory location for the sprites you want to match, for example, by using POKE 2040,192 and POKE 2041, 192 to point sprites 0 and 1 to the same location."
"what is the risk of setting sprite pointers too low in memory?","The risk of setting sprite pointers too low in memory is that a long BASIC program may overwrite the sprite data, or vice versa."
"how can you protect sprite data from being overwritten by a long BASIC program?","You can protect sprite data from being overwritten by a long BASIC program by setting the sprites at a higher area of memory, such as 2040,192 for sprite 0 at locations 12288 to 12350."
"what is the purpose of redefining a sprite pointer?","The purpose of redefining a sprite pointer is to point to different areas of memory containing different sprite picture data, allowing you to define multiple sprites with different shapes."
"can you set sprite pointers anywhere in RAM memory?","Yes, you can set sprite pointers anywhere in RAM memory, but it is recommended to set them at a higher area of memory to protect sprite data from being overwritten by a long BASIC program."
"how many different sprites can you define using this method?","You can define as many as 64 different sprites using this method, plus a sizable BASIC program."
"what is the 'Dancing Mouse' an example of?","The 'Dancing Mouse' is an example of how to redefine a sprite pointer to point to different areas of memory containing different sprite picture data, allowing you to define multiple sprites with different shapes."
