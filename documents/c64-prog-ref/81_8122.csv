"what is the term for the rate at which a note rises from zero volume to its peak volume?","The term for the rate at which a note rises from zero volume to its peak volume is called the ATTACK."
"what is the term for the rate at which a note falls from its peak volume to a mid-ranged volume?","The term for the rate at which a note falls from its peak volume to a mid-ranged volume is called the DECAY."
"what is the term for the mid-ranged volume that a note sustains at after the decay phase?","The term for the mid-ranged volume that a note sustains at after the decay phase is called the SUSTAIN level."
"what is the term for the rate at which a note falls from the sustain level to zero volume when it stops playing?","The term for the rate at which a note falls from the sustain level to zero volume when it stops playing is called the RELEASE."
"what is the collective term for the ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, and RELEASE parameters that control the qualities and restrictions of a note?","The collective term for the ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, and RELEASE parameters that control the qualities and restrictions of a note is called ADSR."
"what do the parameters ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, and RELEASE control in a note?","The parameters ATTACK, DECAY, SUSTAIN, and RELEASE control the qualities and restrictions of a note, such as its volume and duration."
"where are the ADSR parameters controlled in a sound generator chip?","The ADSR parameters are controlled by a set of locations in the sound generator chip."
"what happens to a note when it is first struck?","When a note is first struck, it rises from zero volume to its peak volume, and the rate at which this happens is called the ATTACK."
"what happens to a note after it reaches its peak volume?","After a note reaches its peak volume, it falls from the peak to a mid-ranged volume, and the rate at which the fall of the note occurs is called the DECAY."
"what happens to a note when it stops playing?","When a note stops playing, it falls from the sustain level to zero volume, and the rate at which it falls is called the RELEASE."
