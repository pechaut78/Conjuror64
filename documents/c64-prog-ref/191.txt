  B-15. Function Name: LOAD

    Purpose: Load RAM from device
    Call address: $FFD5 (hex) 65493 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A, X, Y
    Preparatory routines: SETLFS, SETNAM
    Error returns: 0,4,5,8,9, READST
    Stack requirements: None
    Registers affected: A, X, Y

    Description: This routine LOADs data bytes from any input device di-
  rectly into the memory of the Commodore 64. It can also be used for a
  verify operation, comparing data from a device with the data already in
  memory, while leaving the data stored in RAM unchanged.
    The accumulator (.A) must be set to 0 for a LOAD operation, or 1 for a
  verify, If the input device is OPENed with a secondary address (SA) of 0
  the header information from the device is ignored. In this case, the X
  and Y registers must contain the starting address for the load. If the
  device is addressed with a secondary address of 1, then the data is
  loaded into memory starting at the location specified by the header. This
  routine returns the address of the highest RAM location loaded.
    Before this routine can be called, the KERNAL SETLFS, and SETNAM
  routines must be called.


NOTE: You can NOT LOAD from the keyboard (0), RS-232 (2), or the screen (3).

  How to Use:

    0) Call the SETLFS, and SETNAM routines. If a relocated load is de-
       sired, use the SETLFS routine to send a secondary address of 0.
    1) Set the A register to 0 for load, 1 for verify.
    2) If a relocated load is desired, the X and Y registers must be set
       to the start address for the load.
    3) Call the routine using the JSR instruction.
