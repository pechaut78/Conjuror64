"how do you enable a sprite for display on the Commodore 64?","To enable a sprite for display on the Commodore 64, you need to set its corresponding enable bit (MnE) to '1' in register 21 ($15). This allows the sprite to be displayed on the screen, and sprite operations will occur involving the enabled sprite."
"what happens when the MnE bit is set to '0'?","When the MnE bit is set to '0', the sprite is disabled and no sprite operations will occur involving the disabled sprite. This means that the sprite will not be displayed on the screen and will not participate in any sprite-related operations."
"what is the purpose of the MnE bit in register 21?","The MnE bit in register 21 is used to selectively enable or disable a sprite for display on the Commodore 64. By setting the MnE bit to '1', you can enable a sprite, and by setting it to '0', you can disable it."
"where is the MnE bit located?","The MnE bit is located in register 21 ($15) on the Commodore 64. This register is used to control the display of sprites on the screen."
"what is the effect of setting the MnE bit to '1'?","Setting the MnE bit to '1' enables the sprite for display on the Commodore 64, allowing it to be displayed on the screen and participate in sprite-related operations."
"what is the default state of the MnE bit?","The default state of the MnE bit is not explicitly stated, but it can be assumed to be '0', disabling the sprite by default, until it is explicitly set to '1' to enable it."
"can you enable multiple sprites at once?","Yes, you can enable multiple sprites at once by setting the corresponding MnE bits to '1' in register 21 ($15) for each sprite you want to enable."
"what happens if you try to display a disabled sprite?","If you try to display a disabled sprite (i.e., the MnE bit is set to '0'), the sprite will not be displayed on the screen, and no sprite operations will occur involving the disabled sprite."
"how do you disable a sprite?","To disable a sprite, you need to set its corresponding MnE bit to '0' in register 21 ($15). This will prevent the sprite from being displayed on the screen and from participating in sprite-related operations."
"what is the relationship between the MnE bit and sprite operations?","The MnE bit controls whether a sprite is enabled or disabled for display and participation in sprite-related operations. If the MnE bit is set to '1', the sprite is enabled, and if it is set to '0', the sprite is disabled."
