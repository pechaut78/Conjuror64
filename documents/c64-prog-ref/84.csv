question,answer
"Can the SID chip's parameters be changed dynamically during a note or sound?","Yes, the SID chip's parameters can be changed dynamically during a note or sound to create many interesting and fun effects."
"What are the digitized outputs available for you in registers?","Digitized outputs from oscillator three and envelope generator three are available for you in registers 27 and 28, respectively."
"What is the relationship between the output of oscillator 3 and the waveform selected?","The output of oscillator 3 is directly related to the waveform selected."
"What happens to the output of oscillator 3 when the sawtooth waveform is chosen?","The output will present a series of numbers incremented (increased step by step) from 0 to 255 at a rate determined by the frequency of oscillator 3."
"What happens to the output of oscillator 3 when the triangle waveform is chosen?","The output will increment from 0 up to 255, then decrement (decrease step by step) back down to 0."
"What happens to the output of oscillator 3 when the pulse wave is chosen?","The output will jump back-and-forth between 0 and 255."
"What happens to the output of oscillator 3 when the noise waveform is chosen?","The output will give you a series of random numbers."
"What is the purpose of setting bit 7 of register 24?","Setting bit 7 of register 24 turns the audio output of voice 3 off."
"What is the function of register 25?","Register 25 gives you access to the output of the envelope generator of oscillator 3."
"How can vibrato be achieved?","Vibrato can be achieved by adding the output of oscillator 3 to the frequency of another oscillator."
