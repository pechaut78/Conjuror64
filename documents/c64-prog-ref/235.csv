question,answer
"what is the maximum number of RS-232 channels that can be open at any time","Only one RS-232 channel should be open at any time; a second OPEN statement will cause the buffer pointers to be reset."
"what happens to characters in the transmit buffer when a second OPEN statement is executed","Any characters in either the transmit buffer or the receive buffer will be lost."
"how many characters can be sent in the filename field","Up to 4 characters can be sent in the filename field."
"what are the first two characters in the filename field","The first two are the control and command register characters;"
"what are the last two characters in the filename field","the other two are reserved for future system options."
"what options can be selected through the filename field","Baud rate, parity, and other options can be selected through this feature."
"is error-checking done on the control word to detect a non-implemented baud rate","No error-checking is done on the control word to detect a non-implemented baud rate."
"what happens when an illegal control word is used","Any illegal control word will cause the system output to operate at a very slow rate (below 50 baud)."
"what is the BASIC syntax for opening an RS-232 channel","OPEN lfn,2,0,\"<control register><command register><opt baud low><opt baud high>\""
"what is the range of logical file numbers (lfn) that can be used","lfn-The logical file number (lfn) then can be any number from 1 through 255."
"what happens if a logical file number greater than 127 is chosen","if you choose a logical file number that is greater than 127, then a line feed will follow all carriage returns."
"what is the purpose of the control register","Is a single byte character (see Figure 6-1, Control Register Map) required to specify the baud rates."
"how are the baud rates specified in the control register","If the lower 4 bits of the baud rate is equal to zero (0), the <opt baud low><opt baud high> characters give you a rate based on the following:"
"what is the formula for calculating the baud rate","<opt baud low>=<system frequency/rate/2-100-<opt baud high>*256 <opt baud high>=INT((system frequency/rate/2-100)/256"
"what is the system frequency for NTSC TV standard","system frequency = 1.02273E6 NTSC (North American TV standard)"
"what is the system frequency for PAL TV standard","system frequency = 0.98525E6 PAL (U.K. and most European TV standard)"
"what is the purpose of the command register","Is a single byte character (see Figure 6-2, Command Register Map) that defines other terminal parameters."
"is the command register required","This character is NOT required."
"what is the KERNAL entry for opening an RS-232 channel","OPEN ($FFC0) (See KERNAL specifications for more information on entry conditions and instructions.)"
"why should the RS-232 OPEN command be performed before creating variables or arrays","In a BASIC program, the RS-232 OPEN command should be performed before creating any variables or arrays because an automatic CLR is performed when an RS-232 channel is OPENed"
"what happens if 512 bytes of space are not available at the time of the OPEN statement","your program will be destroyed if 512 bytes of space are not available at the time of the OPEN statement."
"what happens when an RS-232 channel is OPENed","an automatic CLR is performed when an RS-232 channel is OPENed (This is due to the allocation of 512 bytes at the top of memory.)"
"why should the RS-232 OPEN command be performed before creating variables or arrays","because an automatic CLR is performed when an RS-232 channel is OPENed (This is due to the allocation of 512 bytes at the top of memory.)"
"what is the consequence of not having 512 bytes of space available at the time of the OPEN statement","your program will be destroyed if 512 bytes of space are not available at the time of the OPEN statement."
"what is the purpose of the OPEN command","to open an RS-232 channel"
"what is the syntax for specifying the baud rate","<opt baud low>=<system frequency/rate/2-100-<opt baud high>*256 <opt baud high>=INT((system frequency/rate/2-100)/256"
"what is the purpose of the control register and command register","to specify the baud rates and other terminal parameters"
"what is the range of baud rates that can be specified","any baud rate can be specified using the control register and command register"
"what happens if an illegal control word is used","the system output will operate at a very slow rate (below 50 baud)"
