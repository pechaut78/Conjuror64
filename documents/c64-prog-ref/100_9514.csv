question,answer
"what does LDA represent in 6510 assembly language","LDA represents 'load accumulator with...' and what the accumulator should be loaded with is decided by the parameter(s) associated with that instruction."
"in 6510 assembly language, how many characters do mnemonics have","mnemonics are always three characters."
"what happens when you put a '#' symbol in front of the parameter associated with the instruction","this means that you want the register specified in the instruction to be loaded with the 'value' after the '#'."
"what is the token for the LDA instruction in immediate mode","the token for this particular instruction, in this mode, is $A9."
"what is the difference between immediate mode and absolute mode of instruction","in immediate mode, the parameter is a 'value', rather than the contents of a memory location, or another register, whereas in absolute mode, the parameter is the contents of a memory location."
"what is the token for the LDA instruction in absolute mode","the token for the LDA instruction in absolute mode is $AD."
"in which mode is the parameter a 'value'","in immediate mode, the parameter is a 'value'."
"in which mode is the parameter the contents of a memory location","in absolute mode, the parameter is the contents of a memory location."
"what is the purpose of the '#' symbol in the instruction","the '#' symbol indicates that the parameter is a 'value'."
"what is the result of the instruction LDA #$05","this instruction will put $05 (decimal 5) into the accumulator register."
"what does the assembler do when assembling an instruction","the assembler puts into memory (at whatever address has been specified), the token, and what parameters, are given."
"what happens if you try to assemble something that the assembler or the 6510 microprocessor cannot do","some assemblers give error messages, or warnings."
"what is the purpose of the assembler","the assembler puts into memory (at whatever address has been specified), the token, and what parameters, are given."
"what is the difference between the LDA instruction in immediate mode and absolute mode","the LDA instruction in immediate mode has $A9 as its token, and the LDA instruction in absolute mode has $AD as its token."
"what is the result of the instruction LDA $102E","this instruction will put the contents of memory location $102E into the accumulator."
"in which mode is the parameter the contents of another register","neither immediate nor absolute mode, as the parameter is either a 'value' or the contents of a memory location."
"what is the purpose of the token in the instruction","the token is used by the 6510 microprocessor to distinguish between different instructions."
"what is the purpose of the parameter in the instruction","the parameter specifies what the accumulator should be loaded with."
"what is the difference between the LDA instruction and other instructions","the LDA instruction is used to load the accumulator, whereas other instructions are used for different purposes."
"what is the purpose of the accumulator","the accumulator is a register that holds the result of an instruction."
"what is the result of the instruction LDA #$05 in decimal","this instruction will put 5 into the accumulator register."
"what is the address where the token and parameters are stored","the address is specified by the programmer."
"what is the purpose of the assembler warnings or error messages","the warnings or error messages are used to inform the programmer of errors or inconsistencies in the code."
"what is the token for the LDA instruction in immediate mode in hexadecimal","the token for the LDA instruction in immediate mode is $A9 in hexadecimal."
"what is the token for the LDA instruction in absolute mode in hexadecimal","the token for the LDA instruction in absolute mode is $AD in hexadecimal."
"in which mode is the parameter a memory location","in absolute mode, the parameter is a memory location."
