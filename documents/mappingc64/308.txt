Discard a Temporary String

This routine calls the following routine which clears an entry from
the temporary descriptor stack.  If the descriptor was on the stack,
it exits after setting pointers to the string and its length.  If it
wasn't on the temporary stack and is at the bottom of string text
storage, the pointer to the bottom is moved up to deallocate the
string.
