Set Time-Out Flag for IEEE Bus

This documented Kernal routine can be entered fromthe jump table at
65442 ($FFA2).

The routine sets the time-out flag for the IEEE bus.  When timeouts
are enabled, the Commodore will wait for a device for 64 milliseconds,
and if it does not receive a response to its signal it will issue a
time-out error.  Loading the Accumulator with a value less than 128
and calling this routine will enable time-outs, while using a value
over 128 will disable time-outs.

This routine is for use only with the Commodore IEEE add-on card,
which at the time of this writing was not yet available.
