Current Foreground Color for Text

The process of PRINTing a character to the screen consists of both
placing the screen code value for the character in screen memory and
placing a foreground color value in the corresponding location in
color RAM.  Whenever a character is PRINTed, the Operating System
fetches the value to be put in color RAM from this location.

The foreground color may be changed in a number of ways.  Pressing the
CTRL or Commodore logo key and numbers 1-8 at the same time will
change the value stored here, and thus the color being printed.
PRINTing the PETASCII equivalent character with the CHR$ command will
have the same effect.  But probably the easiest method is to POKE the
color value directly to this location.  The table below lists the
possible colors that may be produced, and shows how to produce them
using all three methods.
