Flat: Type of Numeric Data (Integer or Floating Point)

If data which BASIC is using is determined to be numeric, it is
further classified here as either a floating point number or as an
integer.  A 128 ($80) in this location identifies the number as an
integer, and a 0 indicates a floating point number.
