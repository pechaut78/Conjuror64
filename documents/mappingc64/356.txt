On entry to this routine, .A and .Y point to a five-byte floating
point number to be compared to FAC1.  After the comparison, .A holds 0
if the two are equal, a 1 if the value of FAC1 is greater than that in
the memory location, and 255 ($FF) if the value of FAC1 is less than
that in the memory location.
