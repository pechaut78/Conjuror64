Storage Area for .P (Status) Register

The Status (.P) register has seven different flags.  Their bit
assignments are as follows:

Bit 7 (bit value of 128) = Negative
Bit 6 (bit value of 64)  = Overflow
Bit 5 (bit value of 32)  = Not Used
Bit 4 (bit value of 16)  = BREAK
Bit 3 (bit value of 8)   = Decimal
Bit 2 (bit value of 4)   = Interrupt Disable
Bit 1 (bit value of 2)   = Zero
Bit 0 (bit value of 1)   = Carry

If you wish to clear any flag before a SYS, it is safe to clear them
all with a POKE 783,0.  The reverse is not true, however, as you must
watch out for the Interrupt disable flag.

A 1 in this flag bit is equal to an SEI instruction, which turns off
all IRQ interrupts (like the one that reads the keyboard, for
example).  Turning off the keyboard could make the computer very
difficult to operate!  To set all flags except for Interrupt disable
to 1, POKE 783,247.
