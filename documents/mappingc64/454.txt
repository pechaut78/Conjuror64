Complex Interface Adapter (CIA) #1 Registers

Locations 56320-56335 ($DC00-$DC0F) are used to communicate with the
Complex Interface Adapter chip #1 (CIA #1).  This chip is a successor
to the earlier VIA and PIA devices used on the VIC-20 and PET.  This
chip functions the same way as the VIA and PIA:  It allows the 6510
microprocessor to communicate with peripheral input and output
devices.  The specific devices that CIA #1 reads data from and sends
data to are the joystick controllers, the paddle fire buttons, and the
keyboard.

In addition to its two data ports, CIA #1 has two timers, each of
which can count an interval from a millionth of a second to a
fifteenth of a second.  Or the timers can be hooked together to count
much longer intervals.  CIA #1 has an interrupt line which is
connected to the 6510 IRQ line.  These two timers can be used to
generate interrupts at specified intervals (such as the 1/60 second
interrupt used for keyboard scanning, or the more complexly timed
interrupts that drive the tape read and write routines).  As you will
see below, the CIA chip has a host of other features to aid in
Input/Output functions.
