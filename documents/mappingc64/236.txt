Perform FOR

FOR is performed mostly by saving the needed information for the NEXT
part of the command on the stack (see the entry for 256 ($100) for
details).  This includes the TO termination value, so if the upper
limit is a variable, the current value of the variable will be stored,
and you cannot end the loop early by decreasing the value of the TO
variable within the loop (although you can end it early by increasing
the value of the FOR variable within the loop).

Also, since the TO expression is evaluated only once, at the time FOR
is performed, a statement such as FOR I=1 TO I+100 is valid.  The
terminating value is not checked until NEXT is executed, so the loop
statements always execute at least once.  The variable used by FOR
must be a nonarray floating point variable.  Reusing the same FOR
variable in a loop that is still active will cause the previous FOR
loop and all intervening loops to be cancelled.
