RS-232 Baud Rate Tables for U.S. Television Standard (NTSC)

This table contains the ten prescaler values for the ten standard baud
rates implemented by the RS-232 Control Register at 659 ($293).  The
table starts with the two values needed for the lowest baud rate (50
baud) and finishes with the entries for the highest baud rate, 2400
baud.  The RS-232 routines are handled by NMI interrupts which are
caused by the timers on CIA #2.  Since the RS-232 device could both
receive and send a bit in a single cycle, the time between interrupts
should be a little less than half of the clock frequency divided by
the baud rate.  The exact formula used is:

((CLOCK/BAUD)/2)-100

where CLOCK is the processor clock speed and BAUD is the baud rate.
The clock frequency for machines using the U.S. television standard
(NTSC) is 1,022,730 cycles per second, while the frequency for the
European (PAL) standard is 985,250 cycles per second.  For this
reason, separate baud rate tables were added for European machines at
58604 ($E4EC).
