Column position of the Cursor before the Last TAB or SPC

TRMPOS is used by TAB and SPC.  The cursor column position prior to
the TAB or SPC is moved here from 211 ($D3), and is used to calculate
where the cursor ends up after one of these functions is invoked.
Note that the value contained here shows the position of the cursor on
a logical line.  Since one logical line can be up to two physical
lines long, the value stored here can range from 0 to 79.
