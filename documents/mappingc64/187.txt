Kernal Indirect Vectors

There are 39 Kernal routines for which there are vectors in the jump
table located at the top of the ROM (65409, $FF81).  For ten of these
routines, the jump table entry contains a machine language instruction
to jump to the address pointed to by the RAM vector in this table.
The addresses in this table are initialized to point to the
corresponding routines in the Kernal ROM.  Since these addresses are
in RAM, however, any entry in this table may be changed.  This enables
the user to add to these routines, or to replace them completely.

You will notice, for example, that many of these routines involve
Input/ Output functions.  By changing the vectors  to these routines,
it is possible to support new I/O devices, such as an IEEE disk drive
used through an adapter.

The user should be cautioned that since some of these routines are
interrupt-driven, it is dangerous to change these vectors without
first turning off all interrupts.  For a safe method of changing all
of these vectors at one time, along with the interrupt vectors above,
see the entry for the Kernal VECTOR routine at 64794 ($FD1A).

More specific information about the individual routines can be found
in the descriptions given for their ROM locations.
