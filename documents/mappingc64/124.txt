address       $F7-$F8        RIBUF
Pointer: RS-232 Input Buffer

When device number 2 (the RS-232 channel) is opened, two buffers of
256 bytes each are created at the top of memory.  This location points
to the address of the one which is used to store characters as they
are received.  A BASIC program should always OPEN device 2 before
assigning any variables to avoid the consequences of overwriting
variables which were previously located at the top of memory, as BASIC
executes a CLR after opening this device.
