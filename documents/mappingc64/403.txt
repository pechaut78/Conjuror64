Sprite Multicolor Registers

Bit 0:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 0 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 1:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 1 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 2:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 2 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 3:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 3 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 4:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 4 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 5:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 5 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 6:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 6 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)
Bit 7:  Select multicolor mode for Sprite 7 (1=multicolor, 0=hi-res)

Sprite multicolor mode is very similar to text and bitmap multicolor
modes (see Bit 4 of 53270, $D016).  Normally, the color of each dot of
the sprite is controlled by a single bit of sprite shape data.  When
thi mode is enabled for a sprite, by setting the corresponding bit of
this register to 1, the bits of sprite shape data are grouped together
in pairs, with each pair of bits controlling a double-wide dot of the
sprite display.  By sacrificing some of the horizontal resolution (the
sprite, although the same size, is now only 12 dots wide), you gain
the use of two additional colors.  The four possible combinations of
these bit-pairs display dot colors from the following sources:

00 Background Color Register 0 (transparent)
01 Sprite Multicolor Register 0 (53285, $D025)
10 Sprite Color Registers (53287-94, $D027-E)
11 Sprite Multicolor Register 1 (53286, $D026)

Like multicolor text characters, multicolor sprites all share two
color registers.  While each sprite can display three foreground
colors, only one of these colors in unique to that sprite.  The number
of unique colors may be increated by combining more than one sprite
into a single character.
