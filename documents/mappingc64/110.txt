Timer: Countdown to Blink Cursor

The interrupt routine that blinks the cursor uses this location to
tell when it's time for a blink.  First the number 20 is put here, and
every jiffy (1/60 second) the value here is decreased by one, until it
reaches zero.  Then the cursor is blinked, the number 20 is put back
here, and the cycle starts all over again.  Thus, under normal
circumstances, the cursor blinks three times per second.
