Flag: Kernal Message Control

This flag is set by the Kernal routine SETMSG (65048, $FE18), and it
controls whether or not Kernal error messages or control messages will
be displayed.

A value of 192 ($C0) here means that both Kernal error and control
messages will be displayed.  This will never normally occur when using
BASIC, which prefers its own plain text error messages over the
Kernal's perfunctory I/O ERROR (number).  The Kernal error messages
might be used, however, when you are SAVEing or LOADing with a machine
language monitor.

A 128 ($80) means that control messages only will be displayed.  Such
will be the case when you are in the BASIC direct or immediate mode.
These messages include SEARCHING, SAVING, FOUND, etc.

A value of 64 means that Kernal error messages only are on.  A 0 here
suppresses the display of all Kernal messages.  This is the value
placed here when BASIC enters the program or RUN mode.
