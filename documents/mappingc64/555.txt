Scroll Screen

This subroutine moves all of the screen lines up, so that a blank line
is created at the bottom of the screen and the top screen line is
lost.  If the top logical line is two physical lines long, all lines
are moved up two lines.  Holding down the CTRL key will cause a brief
pause after the scroll.
