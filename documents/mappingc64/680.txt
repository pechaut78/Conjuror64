6510 Hardware Vectors

The last six locations in memory are reserved by the 6510 processor
chip for three fixed vectors.  These vectors let the chip know at what
address to start executing machine language program code when an NMI
interrupt occurs, when the computer is turned on, or when an IRQ
interrupt or BRK occurs.
