This is the default location of the video screen memory area, which
contains the video matrix and the sprite data pointers.  Keep in mind,
however, that the video screen memory area can be relocated to start
on any even 1K boundary.  Its location at any given moment is
getermined by the VIC-II chip memory control register at 53272

(56576, $DD00).
