Voice 1 Sustain/Release Control Register

Bits 0-3:  Select release cycle duration (0-15)
Bits 4-7:  Select sustain volume level (0-15)

Bits 4-7 select the volume level at which the note is sustained.
Following the decay cycle, the volume of the output of voice 1 will
remain at the selected sustain level as long as the gate bit of the
Control Register is set to 1.  The sustain values range from 0, which
chooses no volume, to 15, which sets the output of voice 1 equal to
the peak volume achieved during the attack cycle.

Bits 0-3 determine the length of the release cycle.  This phase, in
which the volume fades from the sustain level to near zero volume,
begins when the gate bit of the Control Register is set to 0 (while
leaving the waveform setting that was previously chosen).  The
duration of this decline in volume corresponds to the number (0-15)
selected in the same way as for the decay value:

0 = 6 milliseconds           8 = 300 milliseconds
1 = 24 milliseconds          9 = 750 milliseconds
2 = 48 milliseconds         10 = 1.5 seconds
3 = 72 milliseconds         11 = 2.4 seconds
4 = 114 milliseconds        12 = 3 seconds
5 = 168 milliseconds        13 = 9 seconds
6 = 204 milliseconds        14 = 15 seconds
7 = 240 milliseconds        15 = 24 seconds

Voice 2 and Voice 3 Controls

The various control registers for these two voices correspond almost
exactly to those of voice 1.  The one exception is that the sync and
ring-modulation bits of voice 2 operate on Oscillators 1 and 2, while
the same bits of the Control Register for voice 3 uses Oscillators 2
and 3.
