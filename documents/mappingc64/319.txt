Get a 16-Bit Address Parameter and an 8-Bit Parameter (for POKE and WAIT)

This routine gets the next numeric parameter from the current place in
program text.  The routine evaluates it, checks that it is a positive
integer within the range 0-65535, and changes it from floating point
to a two-byte integer in 20-21 ($14-$15).  It checks for and skips a
comma, then gets a one-byte integer parameter in the .X register.  The
routine is used to get the parameters for POKE an WAIT.
