Perform GET and GET#

The GET routine first makes sure that the program is not in direct
mode.  It opens an input channel using the Kernal CHKIN routine
(61966, $F20E) if a number sign was added to make GET#.  Then it calls
the common I/O routines in READ to get a single character, and causes
the input channel to be closed if one was opened.
