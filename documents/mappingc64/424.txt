Voice 1 Pulse Waveform Width Control

As you will see below under the description of the Control Register at
54276 ($D404), you can select one of four different waveforms for the
output of each voice.  If the pulse waveform is selected, these
registers must be set to establish the pulse width.

The pulse width has a 12-bit resolution, being made up of the value in
the first register and the value in the lower nybble of the second
register.  The pulse width determines the duty cycle, or proportion of
the time that the rectangular wave will stay at the high part of the
cycle.

The following formula shows the relationship between the value in the
Pulse Width Register and the proportion of time that the wave stays at
the high part of the cycle:

PULSE WIDTH=(REGISTER VALUE/40.95)%

The possible range of the register values (0-4095) covers the range of
the duty cycles from 0 to 100 percent in 4096 steps.  Changing the
pulse width will vastly change the sound created with the pulse
waveform.
