Commodore Logo Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the logo keyboard, one
for each key which is struck while the Commodore logo key is pressed.
The table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for
the correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of
255 ($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress
value of 64, no key pressed).
