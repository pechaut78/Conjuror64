Character ROM Image for VIC-II Chip When Using Memory Bank 2

When the VIC-II chip is set up to use the third 16K block of memory
for graphics (as would be the case when the 64 is set up to emulate
the PET, which has its text screen memory at 32768 ($8000), it sees
the character generator ROM at this address (see entry at 4096 ($1000)
above for more details).

It should be noted that the character ROM is available only when the
VIC-II chip is using banks 0 or 2.  When using one of the other two
banks, the user must supply all of the character shape data in a RAM
table.
