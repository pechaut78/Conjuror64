This routine calculates the natural logarithm e (2.718281828...)
raised to the power in FAC1.  The result is left in FAC1.

This routine is split between the BASIC ROM wich ends at 49151 ($BFFF)
and the Kernal ROM which begins at 57344 ($E000).  Therefore, a JMP
$E000 instruction is tacked on to the end, which makes the BASIC
routines in the 64 Kernal ROM three bytes higher in memory than the
corresponding VIC-20 routines.
