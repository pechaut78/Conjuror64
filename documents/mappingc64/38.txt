address         $47-$48        VARPNT
Pointer to the Current BASIC Variable Value

This location points to the address of the descriptor of the current
BASIC variable (see location 45 ($2D) for the format of a variable
descriptor).  Specifically, it points to the byte just after the
two-character variable name.

During a FN call, this location does not point to the dependent
variable (the A of FN A), so that a real variable of the same name
will not have its value changed by the call.
