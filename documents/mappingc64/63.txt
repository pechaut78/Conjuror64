Flag: Was STOP Key Pressed?

This location is updated every 1/60 second during the execution of the
IRQ routine that reads the keyboard and updates the jiffy clock.

The value of the last row of the keyboard matrix is placed here.  That
row contains the STOP key, and although this location is used
primarily to detect when that key has been pressed, it can also detect
when any of the other keys in that row of the matrix have been
pressed.

In reading the keyboard matrix, a bit set to 1 means that no key has
been pressed, while a bit reset to 0 indicates that a key is pressed.
Therefore, the following values indicate the keystrokes detailed
below:

255 $FF  = no key pressed
254 $FE  = 1 key pressed
253 $FD  = (left arrow) key pressed
251 $FB  = CTRL key pressed
247 $F7  = 2 key pressed
239 $EF  = space bar pressed
223 $DF  = Commodore logo key pressed
191 $BF  = Q key pressed
127 $7F  = STOP key pressed

VIC owners will notice that the 64's keyboard matrix is very different
from the VIC's.  One of the advantages of this difference is that you
can test for the STOP key by following a read of this location with a
BPL instruction, which will cause a branch to occur anytime that the
STOP key is pressed.
