Pause after Finding a File on Cassette

This routine is a patch to the routine which finds a file on cassette.
After the file is found, the message FILETITLE FOUND appears on the
screen.  On the original versions of the Kernal, the user would then
have to hit the Commodore key to continue the load.  On the newer
versions, this patch causes a slight pause after the tape file is
round, during which time a keypress is looked for.  If a key is
pressed, the loading process continues immediately.  If it is not, the
load continues by itself after the end of the pause.
