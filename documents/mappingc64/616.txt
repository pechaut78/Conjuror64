CLALL is a documented Kernal routine whose entry point in the jump
table is 65511 ($FFE7).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 812 ($32C).  It closes all
open files, by resetting the index into open files at 152 ($98) to
zero.  It then falls through to the next routine, which restores the
default I/O devices.
