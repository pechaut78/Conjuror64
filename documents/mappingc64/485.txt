Serial Data Port

The CIA chip has an on-chip serial port, which allows you to send or
receive a byte of data one bit at a time, with the most significant
bit (Bit 7) being transferred first.  For more information about its
use, see the entry for location 56332 ($DC0C).  The 64's Operating
System does not use this facility.
