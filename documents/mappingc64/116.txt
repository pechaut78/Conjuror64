Flag: Editor in Quote Mode? 0=No

A nonzero value in this location indicates that the editor is in quote
mode.  Quote mode is toggled every time that you type in a quotation
mark on a given line--the first quote mark turns it on, the second
turns it off, the third turns it back on, etc.

If the editor is in this mode when a cursor control character or other
nonprinting character is entered, a printed equivalent will appear on
the screen instead of the cursor movement or other control operation
taking place.  Instead, that action is deferred until the string is
sent to the string by a PRINT statement, at which time the cursor
movement or other control operation will take place.

The exception to this rule is the DELETE key, which will function
normally within quote mode.  The only way to print a character which
is equivalent to the DELETE key is by entering insert mode (see
loctaion 216 ($D8)).  Quote mode may be exited by printing a closing
quote, or by hitting the RETURN or SHIFT-RETURN keys.

Sometimes, it would be handy to be able to escape from quote mode or
insert mode without skipping to a new line.  The machine language
program below hooks into the keyscan interrupt routine, and allows you
to escape quote mode by changing this flag to 0 when you press the f1
key:
