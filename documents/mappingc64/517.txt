Warm Start BASIC

This is the entry point into BASIC from the BRK routine at 65126
($FE66), which is executed when the STOP and RESTORE keys are both
pressed.  It first executes the Kernal CLRCHN routine which closes all
files.  It then sets the default devices, resets the stack and BASIC
program pointers, and jumps through the vector at 768 ($300) to the
next routine to print the READY prompt and enter the main BASIC loop.
