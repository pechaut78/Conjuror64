Load RAM from a Device

This is a documented Kernal routine, whose entry in the jump table
appears at 65493 ($FFD5).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 816 ($330).  LOAD is used to
transfer data froma device directly to RAM.  It can also be used to
verify RAM, comparing its contents to those of a disk or tape file.
To choose between these operations you must set the Accumulator with a
0 for LOAD, or a 1 for VERIFY.

Since the LOAD routine performs an OPEN, it must be preceded by a call
to the SETLFS routine to specify the logical file number, device
number, and secondary address, and a call to the SETNAM routine to
specify the filename (a LOAD from tape can be performed without a
filename being specified).  Then the .X and .Y registers should be set
with the starting address for the load, and the LOAD routine called.
If the secondary address specified was a 1, this starting address will
be ignored, and the header information will be used to supply the load
address.  If the secondary address was a 0, the address supplied by
the call will be used.  In either case, upon return from the
subroutine, the .X and .Y registers will contain the address of the
highest RAM location that was loaded.
