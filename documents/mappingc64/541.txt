Wait for a Carriage Return from the Keyboard

This subroutine is called by the portion of the CHKIN routine that
handles keyboard input.  It turns the cursor on, gets characters, and
echoes them to the screen until a carriage return has been entered.
It also looks for the shifted RUN/STOP key, and forces the output of
the commands LOAD and RUN if it finds it.
