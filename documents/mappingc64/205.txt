Sprite Shape Data Pointers

The last eight bytes of the video matrix (whether it is here at the
default location, or has been relocated elsewhere) are used as
pointers to the data blocks used to define the sprite shapes.

Each sprite is 3 bytes wide (24 bits) by 21 lines high.  It therefore
requires 63 bytes for its shape definition, but it actually uses 64
bytes in order to arrive at an even 256 shape blocks in the 16K area
of RAM which the VIC-II chip addresses.

Each pointer holds the current data block being used to define the
shape of one sprite.  The block numver used to define the shape of
Sprite 0 is held in location 2040 ($7F8), the Sprite 1 shape block is
designated by location 2041 ($7F9), etc.  The value in the pointer
times 64 equals the starting location of the sprite shape data table.
For example, a value of 11 in location 2040 indicates that the shape
data for Sprite 0 starts at address 704 (11*64), and continues for 63
more bytes to 767.

individual VIC-II chip sprite graphics locations, and the summary at
the beginning of the VIC-II chip section, at 53248 ($D000).
