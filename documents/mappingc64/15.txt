Flag: Subscript Reference to an Array or User-Defined Function Call (FN)

This flag is used by the PTRGET routine which finds or creates a
variable, at the time it checks whether the name of a variable is
valid.  If an opening parenthesis is found, this flag is set to
indicate that the variable in question is either an array variable or
a user-defined function.

You should note that it is perfectly legal for a user-defined function
(FN) to have the same name as a floating point variable.  Moreover, it
is also legal to redefine a function.  Using a FN name in an already
defined function results in the new definition of the function.
