Low Order Mantissa Byte of Floating Point Accumulator #1 (For
Rounding)

If the mantissa of the floating point number has more significant
figures than can be held in four bytes, the least significant figures
are placed here.  They are used to extend the accuracy of intermediate
mathematical operations and to round to the final figure.
