This area is used to store important information for the Operating
System and BASIC.  It contains vectors to certain BASIC routines as
well as Operating System Kernal routines.  Registers for RS-232 serial
I/O are located here.  Buffer space is allocated in this area for tape
I/O, BASIC text input, and the keyboard queue.  In addition, there are
a number of Operating System variables and pointers here which the
programmer can utilize.
