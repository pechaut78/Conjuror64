RS-232 Pseudo 6551 Registers

For serial Input/Output via the RS-232 port, the internal software of
the Commodore 64 emulates the operation of a 6551 UART chip (that's
Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, for you acronym buffs),
also known as an ACIA (Asynchronous Communications Interface Adapter).

These RAM locations are used to mimic the functions of that chip's
hardware command, control, and status registers.  Although RAM
locations are allocated for mimicking the 6551's ability to use either
an on-board baud rate generator or an external clock crystal, this
function is not implemented by the internal software.

Provisions have been made for the user to communicate with these
registers through the RS-232 OPEN command.  When device 2 is opened, a
filename of up to four characters may be appended.  These four
characters are copied to locations 659-662 ($293-$296), although the
last two, which specify a nonstandard baud rate, are not used because
that feature is not implemented.
