Flag: Is Data Input to GET, READ or INPUT?

Since the keywords GET, INPUT, and READ perform similar functions,
BASIC executes some of the same instructions for all three.  There are
also many areas of difference, however, and this flag indicates which
of the three keywords is currently being executed, so that BASIC will
know whether or not to execute the instructions which relate to the
areas in which the commands differ (152 ($98)=READ, 64 ($40)=GET,
0=INPUT).

As a result, INPUT will show the ? prompt, will echo characters back
to the screen, and will wait for a whole line of text ended by a
carriage return.  GET gives no prompt and accepts one character
without waiting.  The colon character and the comma are valid data for
GET, but are treated as delimiters between data by INPUT and READ.

As each command has its own error messages, this flag is used to
determine the appropriate message to issue in case of an error.
