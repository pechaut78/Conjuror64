Matrix Coordinate of Last Key Pressed, 64=None Pressed

During every normal IRQ interrput this location is set with the value
of the last keypress, to be used in keyboard debouncing.  The
Operating System can check if the current keypress is the same as the
last one, and will not repeat the character if it is.

The value returned here is based on the keyboard matrix values as set
forth in the explanation of location 56320 ($DC00).  The values
returned for each key pressed are shown at the entry for location 203
($CB).
