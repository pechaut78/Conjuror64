Perform FRE

The FRE function calls the garbage collection routine at 46374 ($B526)
to get rid of unused string text, and calculates the difference
between the bottom of string text and the top of array storage.  It
then drops through to the follow routine, which assumes that the free
memory value is a 16-bit signed integer, and converts it to floating
point accordingly.

Of course, while the free memory space on the PET might have always
been 32767 or less (the maximum value of a signed integer), sich is
definitely not the case on the 64.  Because conversion is from a
signed integer, any memory value over 32767 will be regarded as
negative (the high bit is treated as a sign bit).  Therefore, for
these higher values you must add twice the bit value of the high bit
(65536) in order to come up with the correct value.  The expression
FRE(0)-6556*(FRE(0)<0) will always return the correct amount of free
memory.
