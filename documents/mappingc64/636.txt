Test Cassette Buttons and Handle Messages for Tape Write

This routine tests the sense switch, and if no buttons are depressed
it prints the PRESS PLAY & RECORD message, and loops until a cassette
button is pressed, or until the STOP key is pressed.  If a button is
pressed, it prints the message OK.  These messages cannot be supressed
by changing the flag at 157 ($9D).  See the entry for 63511 ($F817)
for more information.
