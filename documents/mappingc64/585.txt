Send a Byte to an I/O Device over the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at 65448 ($FFA8).  Its purpose is to send a byte of data over
the serial bus.  In order for the data to be received, the serial
device must have first been commanded to LISTEN and been given a
secondary address if necessary.  This routine always buffers the
current character, and defers sending it until the next byte is
buffered.  When the UNLISTEN command is sent, the last byte will be
sent with an End or Identify (EOI).
