GETIN for the RS-232 Device

The Kernal GETIN routine calls this subroutine to remove the next byte
of data from the RS-232 receive buffer and return it in the
Accumulator.  The routine checks for the Receive Buffer Empty Error.
It is also called by the Kernal CHRIN routine, which essentially does
the same thing as GETIN for the RS-232 device.
