CIA #2 Data Direction Registers A and B

These Data Direction registers control the direction of data flow over
Data Ports A and B.  For more details on the operation of these
registers, see the entry for the CIA #1 Data Direction Registers at
56322 ($DC02).

The default setting for Data Direction Register A is 63 (all bits
except 6 and 7 are outputs), and for Data Direction Register B the
default setting is 0 (all inputs).  Bits 1 and 2 of Port B are changed
to output when the RS-232 device is opened.
