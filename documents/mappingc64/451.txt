Envelope Generator 3 Output

This register allows you to read the output of the voice 3 Envelope
generator, in much the same way that the preceding register lets you
read the output of Oscillator 3.  This output can also be added to
another oscillator's Frequency Control Registers, Pulse Width
Registers, or the Filter Frequency Control Register.  In order to
produce any output from this register, however, the gate bit in
Control Register 3 must be set to 1.  Just as in the production of
sound, setting the gate bit to 1 starts the attack/decay/sustain
cycle, and setting it back to 0 starts the release cycle.

The SID chip has been provided with enough addresses for 32 different
registers, but as it has only 29, the remaining three addresses are
not used.  Reading them will always return a value of 255 ($FF), and
writing to them will have no effect.
