Set Logical File Number, Device Number, and Secondary Address

This is a documented Kernal routine, which can be entered through the
jump table at location 65466 ($FFBA).

It stores the value in the Accumulator in the location which holds the
current logical file number, the value in the .X register is put in
the location that holds the current device number, and the value in
the .Y register is stored in the location that holds the current
secondary address.  If no secondary address is used, the .Y register
should be set to 255 ($FF).  It is necessary to set the values of the
current file number, device number, and secondary address before you
OPEN a file, or LOAD or SAVE.
