RS-232 Input Byte Buffer/Cassette Temporary Storage

Serial routines use this area to reassemble the bits received into a
byte that will be stored in the receiving buffer pointer to by 247
($F7).  Tape routines use this as a flag to help determine whether a
received character should be treated as data or as a synchronization
character.
