Floating Point Accumulator #1: Mantissa

The most significant digit can be assumed to be a 1 (remember that the
range of the mantissa is from 1 to 1.99999...) when a floating point
number is stored to a variable.  The first bit is used for the sign of
the number, and the other 31 bits of the four-byte mantissa hold the
other significant digits.

The first two bytes (98-99, $62-$63) of this location will hold the
signed integer result of a floating point to integer conversion, in
high-byte, low- byte order.
