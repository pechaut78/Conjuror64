Kernal I/O Status Word (ST)

The Kernal routines which open I/O channels or perform input/output
functions check and update this location.  The value here is almost
always the same as that returned to BASIC by use of the reserved
variable ST.  Note that BASIC syntax will not allow an assignment such
as ST=4.  A table of status codes for cassette and serial devices
follows below:

Cassette:
Bit 2 (Bit Value of 4) = Short Block
Bit 3 (Bit Value of 8) = Long Block
Bit 4 (Bit Value of 16) = Unrecoverable error (Read), mismatch
Bit 5 (Bit Value of 32) = Checksum error
Bit 6 (Bit Value of 64) = End of file

Serial Devices:
Bit 0 (Bit Value of 1) = Time out (Write)
Bit 1 (Bit Value of 2) = Time out (Read)
Bit 6 (Bit Value of 64) = EOI (End or Identify)
Bit 7 (Bit Value of 128) = Device not present

Probably the most useful bit to test is Bit 6 (end of file).  When
using the GET statement to read in individual bytes from a file, the
statement IF ST AND 64 will be true if you have got to the end of the
file.

($297).
