Test Cassette Buttons and Handle Messages for Tape Read

This routine tests the sense switch, and if no buttons are depressed
it prints the PRESS PLAY ON TAPE message, and loops until a cassette
button is pressed, or until the STOP key is pressed.  If a button is
pressed, it prints the message OK.

Since the message printing routine is entered after the test for
direct mode, these messages cannot be superseded by changing the flag
at 157 ($9D).  You could have them harmlessly printed to ROM, however,
by changing the value of HIBASE at 648 ($288) temporarily to 160, and
then back to 4.
