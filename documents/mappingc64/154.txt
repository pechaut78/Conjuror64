RS-232: Mock 6551 Command Register

This location performs the same function as the 6551 UART chip's
command register, which specifies type of parity, duplex mode, and
handshaking protocol.

The type of parity used determines how the 64 will check that RS-232
data is received correctly.

The duplex mode can be either full duplex (the 64 will be able to
transmit at the same time it is receiving) or half duplex (it will
take turns sending and receiving).

The handshaking protocol has to do with the manner in which the
sending device lets the receiver know that it is ready to send data,
and the receiver lets the sender know that it has gotten the data
correctly.  The meanings of the bit patterns in this register are as
follows:

Bits 7-5: Parity
XX0 (bit value of
     0,64,128, or 192) = No Parity Generated or Received
001 (bit value of 32)  = Odd Parity Transmitted and Received
011 (bit value of 96)  = Even Parity Transmitted and Received
101 (bit value of 160) = Mark Parity Transmitted and Received
111 (bit value of 224) = Space Parity Transmitted and Received

Bit 4: Duplex
0 (bit value of 0)  = Full Duplex
1 (bit value of 16) = Half Duplex

Bits 3-1: Unused

Bit 0: Handshake Protocol
0 (bit value of 0) = 3 Line
1 (bit value of 1) = X Line

This register can be set at the user's option when opening RS-232
device (number 2).  The second character of the filename will be
stored here.  For example, the statement

OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(6+32)+CHR$(32+16)

will set the value of this location to 48, which is the value of the
second character in the filename portion of the statement.  As you can
see from the above chart, this configures the RS-232 device for half
duplex data transfer using odd parity and three-line handshaking.
