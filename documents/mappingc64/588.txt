Receive a Byte of Data from a Device on the Serial Bus

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry point in the jump
table is 65445 ($FFA5).  When called, it will get a byte of data from
the current TALKer on the serial bus and store it in the Accumulator.
In order to receive the data, the device must have previously been
sent a command to TALK and a secondary address if it needs one.
