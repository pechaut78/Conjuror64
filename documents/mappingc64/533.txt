address              $E505          SCREEN
Store Number of Screen Rows and Columns in .Y and .X

This is a documented Kernal routine which is vectored in the jump
table at 65517 ($FFED), and is provided to allow for program
compatibility between computers.

When called, this subroutine returns the number of screen columns in
the .X register, and the number of screen rows in .Y.  Thus, a program
can detect the screen format of the machine on which it is running,
and make sure that text output is formatted accordingly.

The present version of this routine loads the .X register with 40
($28) and the .Y register with 25 ($19).
