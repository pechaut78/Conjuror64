address         $A94B          ONGOTO
Perform ON GOTO or ON GOSUB

ON is performed by converting the argument to an integer, and then
skipping a number between commas each time that the integer is
decremented until the argument reaches 0.  If a GOTO or GOSUB is the
next token, the current number between commas is used to execute one
of those statements.  If the numbers between commas are used up before
the argument reaches 0, the statement has no effect, and the next
statement is executed.
