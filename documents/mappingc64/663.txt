Set Filename Parameters

This is a documented Kernal routine, which can be entered through the
jump table at location 65469 ($FFBD).

It puts the value in the Accumulator into the location which stores
the number of characters in the filename, and sets the pointer to the
address of the ASCII text of the filename from the .X and .Y
registers.  This sets up the filename for the OPEN, LOAD, or SAVE
routine.
