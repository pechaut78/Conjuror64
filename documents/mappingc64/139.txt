address       $283-284       MEMSIZ
Pointer: O.S. End of Memory

When the power is first turned on, or a cold start RESET is performed,
the Kernal routine RAMTAS (64848, $FD50) performs a nondestructive
test of RAM from 1024 ($400) up, stopping when the test fails,
indicating the presence of ROM.  This will normally occur at 40960
($A000), the location of the BASIC ROM.  The top of user RAM pointer
is then set to point to that first ROM location.

After BASIC has been started, the system will alter this location only
when an RS-232 channel (device number 2) is OPENed or CLOSEd.  As 512
bytes of memory are required for the RS-232 transmission and reception
buffers, this pointer, as well as the end of BASIC pointer at 55
($37), is lowered to create room for those buffers when the device is
opened.  CLOSing the device resets these pointers.

The Kernal routine MEMTOP (65061, $FE25) may be used to read or set
this pointer.
