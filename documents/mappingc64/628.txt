Set Kernal I/O Error Messages

This subroutine is used to handle I/O errors from Kernal I?O routines.
It calls CLRCHN to restore default I/O devices.  If Bit 6 of the flag
at 157 ($9D) is set, it prints I/O ERROR followed by the error number,
and then sets the Carry flag to indicate an error, with the error
number in the Accumulator.  The Kernal error messages are not used by
BASIC, but may be used by machine language monitors and other
applications.
