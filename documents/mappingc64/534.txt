Read/Set Location of the Cursor

The jump table entry for this documented Kernal is at 65520 ($FFF0).

The routine allows the user to read or set the position of the cursor.
If the carry flag is set with the SEC instruction before calling this
subroutine, cursor column (X position) will be returned in the .X
register, and the cursor row (Y position) will be returned in the .Y
register.  If the carry flag is cleared with a CLC instruction before
entering this routine, and the .Y and .X registers are loaded with the
desired row and column positions respectively, this routine will set
the cursor position accordingly.

The current read routine loads .X and .Y from locations 214 ($D6) and
211 ($D3) respectively.  The cursor set routine stores .X and .Y in
these locations, and calls the routine that sets the screen pointers
at 58732 ($E56C).

The user can access this routine from BASIC by loading the .X, .Y, and
.P register values desired to the save area starting at 780 ($30C).
