Set Flag to Enable or Disable Switching Character Sets

This subroutine is also used to check for special characters to print.
In this case, it checks for the characters that enable or disable the
SHIFT/logo combination from toggling the character set currently in
use (CHR$(8) and CHR$(9)).  If one of these is to be printed, the flag
at 657 ($291) is changed.
