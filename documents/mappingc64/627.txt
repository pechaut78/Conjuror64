Test STOP Key

STOP is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at location 65505 ($FFE1).

It is vectored through RAM at 808 ($328).  The routine checks to see
if the STOP key was pressed during the last UDTIM call.  If it was,
the Zero flag is set to 1, the CLRCHN routine is called to set the
input and output devices back to the keyboard and screen, and the
keyboard queue is emptied.
