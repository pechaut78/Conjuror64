Cursor X,Y Position at Start of Input

These locations keep track of the logical line that the cursor is on,
and its column position on that logical line (in line, column format).

Each logical line may contain one or two 40-column physical lines.
Thus there may be as many as 25 logical lines, or as few as 13 at any
one time.  Therefore, the logical line number might be anywhere from
1-25.  Depending on the length of the logical line, the cursor column
may be from 1-40 or 1-80.

For a more detailed exaplanation of logical lines, see the description
of the screen line link talbe, 217 ($D9).
