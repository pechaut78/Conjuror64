Screen Line Link Table/Editor Temporary Storage

This table contains 25 entries, one for each row of the screen
display.  Each entry has two functions.  Bits 0-3 indicate on which of
the four pages of screen memory  the first byte of memory for that row
is located.  This is used in calculating the pointer to the starting
address of a screen line at 209 ($D1).

While earlier PETs used one table for the low bytes of screen rows and
another for the high bytes, this is not possible on the 64, where
screen memory is not fixed in any one spot.  Therefore, the Operating
System uses a table of low bytes at 60656 ($ECF0), but calculates the
high byte by adding the value of the starting page of screen memory
held in 648 ($288) to the displacement page held here.

The other function of this table is to establish the makeup of logical
lines on the screen.  While each screen line is only 40 characters
long, BASIC allows the entry of program lines that contain up to 80
characters.  Therefore, some method must be used to determine which
pairs of physical lines are linked into a longer logical line, so that
this longer logical line may be edited as a unit.

The high bit of each byte here is used as a flag by the screen editor.
That bit is set (leaving the value of the byte over 128 ($80)) when a
line is the first or only physical line in a logical line.  The high
bit is reset to 0 only when a line is the second half of a logical
line.
