Matrix Coordinate of Current Key Pressed

The keyscan interrupt routine uses this location to indicate which key
is currently being pressed.  The value here is then used as an index
into the appropriate keyboard table to determine which character to
print when a key is struck.

The correspondence between the key pressed and the number stored here
is as follows:

0  = INST/DEL                34 = J
1  = RETURN                  35 = 0

33 = I                       64 = NO KEY PRESSED

The RESTORE key is not accounted for, because it is not part of the
normal keyboard matrix.  Instead, it is connected directly to the
microprocessor NMI line, and causes an NMI interrupt whenever it is
pressed.
