Current BASIC Line Number

This location contains the line number of the BASIC statement which is
currently being executed, in LSB/MSB format.  A value of 255 ($FF) in
location 58 ($3A), which translates to a line number of 65280 or above
(well over the 63999 limit for a program line), means that BASIC is
currently in immediate mode, rather than RUN mode.

BASIC keywords that are illegal in direct mode check 58 ($3A) to
determine whether or not this is the current mode.

When in RUN mode, this location is updated as each new BASIC line is
fetched for execution.  Therefore, a TRACE function could be added by
diverting the vector at 776 ($308), which points to the routine that
executes the next token, to a user-written routine which prints the
line number indicated by this location before jumping to the token
execution routine.  (LISTing the line itself would be somewhat harder,
because LIST uses many Page 0 locations that would have to be
preserved and restored afterwards.)

This line number is used by BREAK and error messages to show where
program execution stopped.  The value here is copied to 59 ($3B) by
STOP, END, and the stop-key BREAK, and copied back by CONT.
