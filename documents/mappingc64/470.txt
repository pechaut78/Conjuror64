Control Register A

Bit 0:  Start Timer A (1=start, 0=stop)
Bit 1:  Select Timer A output on Port B (1=Timer A output appears on Bit 6 of
        Port B)
Bit 2:  Port B output mode (1=toggle Bit 6, 0=pulse Bit 6 for one cycle)
Bit 3:  Timer A run mode (1=one-shot, 0=continuous)
Bit 4:  Force latched value to be loaded to Timer A counter (1=force load
        strobe)
Bit 5:  Timer A input mode (1=count microprocessor cycles, 0=count signals on
        CNT line at pin 4 of User Port)
Bit 6:  Serial Port (56332, $DC0C) mode (1=output, 0=input)
Bit 7:  Time of Day Clock frequency (1=50 Hz required on TOD pin, 0=60 Hz)

Bits 0-3.  This nybble controls Timer A.  Bit 0 is set to 1 to start
the timer counting down, and set to 0 to stop it.  Bit 3 sets the
timer for one-shot or continuous mode.

In one-shot mode, the timer counts down to 0, sets the counter value
back to the latch value, and then sets Bit 0 back to 0 to stop the
timer.  In continuous mode, it reloads the latch value and starts all
over again.

Bits 1 and 2 allow you to send a signal on Bit 6 of Data Port B when
the timer counts.  Setting Bit 1 to 1 forces this output (which
overrides the Data Direction Register B Bit 6, and the normal Data
Port B value).  Bit 2 allows you to choose the form this output to Bit
6 of Data Port B will take.  Setting Bit 2 to a value of 1 will cause
Bit 6 to toggle to the opposite value when the timer runs down (a
value of 1 will change to 0, and a value of 0 will change to 1).
Setting Bit 2 to a value of 0 will cause a single pulse of a one
machine-cycle duration (about a millionth of a second) to occur.

Bit 4.  This bit is used to load the Timer A counter with the value
that was previously written to the Timer Low and High Byte Registers.
Writing a 1 to this bit will force the load (although there is no data
stored here, and the bit has no significance on a read).

Bit 5.  Bit 5 is used to control just what it is Timer A is counting.
If this bit is set to 1, it counts the microprocessor machine cycles
(which occur at the rate of 1,022,730 cycles per second).  If the bit
is set to 0, the timer counts pulses on the CNT line, which is
connected to pin 4 of the User Port.  This allows you to use the CIA
as a frequency counter or an event counter, or to measure pulse width
or delay times of external signals.

Bit 6.  Whether the Serial Port Register is currently inputting or
outputting data (see the entry for that register at 56332 ($DC0C) for
more information) is controlled by this bit.

Bit 7.  This bit allows you to select from software whether the Time
of Day Clock will use a 50 Hz or 60 Hz signal on the TOD pin in order
to keep accurate time (the 64 uses a 60 Hz signal on that pin).
