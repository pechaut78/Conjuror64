Get One Byte from the Input Device

This is a documented Kernal routine whose jump table entry point is at
65508 ($FFE4).  The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 810 ($32A).
Its function is to get a character from the current input device
(whose device number is stored at 153 ($99)).  In practive, it
operates identically to the CHRIN routine below for all devices except
for the keyboard.  If the keyboard is the current input device, this
routine gets one character from the keyboard buffer at 631 ($277).  It
depends on the IRQ interrupt routine to rad the keyboard and put
characters into the buffer.
