Send a Secondary Address to a Device on the Serial Bus after TALK

This is a documented Kernal routine that can be entered from the jump
table at 65430 ($FF96).  It sends a secondary address from the
Accumulator to the device on the serial bus that has just been
commanded to TALK.  This is usually done to give the device more
particular instructions on how the I/O is to be carried out before
information is sent.
