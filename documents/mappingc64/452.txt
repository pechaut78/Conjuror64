SID Register Images

Since the SID chip requires enough addressing lines for only 32
locations (the minimum possible for its 29 registers), none of the
higher bits are decoded when addressing the 1K area that has been
assigned to it.  The result is that every 32-byte area in this 1K
block is a mirror of every other.  For the sake of clarity in your
programs, it is advisable not to use these addresses at all.
