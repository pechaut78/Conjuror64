Common Code for Reading a Data Block from Tape and Writing a Block to Tape

This routine sets the actual reading or writing of a block of data.
It sets CIA #1 Timer B to call the IRQ which drives the actual reading
or writing routine, saves the old IRQ vector, and sets the new IRQ
vector to the read or write routine.  It also blanks the screen so
that the video chip's memory addressing (which normally takes away
some of the 6510 microprocessor's addressing time) will not interfere
with the timing of the routines.
