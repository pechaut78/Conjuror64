Main IRQ/BRK Interrupt Entry Point

The 6510 hardware IRQ/BRK vector at 65534 ($FFFE) points to this
address.

Anytime the BRK instruction is encountered or an IRQ interrupt occurs,
this routine will be executed.  The routine first saves the .A, .X,
and .Y registers on the stack, and then tests the BRK bit of the
status register (.P) to see if a BRK was executed.  If it was, the
routine exits through the RAM BRK vector at 790 ($316), where it will
usually be directed to the BRK routine at 65126 ($FE66).  If not, the
routine exits through the RAM IRQ vector at 788 ($314), where it will
usually be directed to the handler that scans the keyboard at 59953
($EA31).

If you plan to change either of these vectors to your own routine,
remember to pull the stored register values off the stack before
finishing.

Location Range: 65371-65407 ($FF5B-$FF7F)
Patches Added to Later Kernal Versions

This area contains additional code not found in the original version
of the Kernal.  It is used to test whether a European (PAL) or U.S.
(NTSC) standard monitor is used, and to compensate so that the
sixtieth of a second interrupt will be accurately timed on either
system.
