Tape Motor Interlock

This location is maintained by the IRQ interrupt routine that scans
the keyboard.  Whenever a button is pressed on the recorder, this
location is checked.  If it contains a 0, the motor is turned on by
setting Bit 5 of location 1 to 0.  When the button is let up, the tape
motor is turned off, and this location is set to 0.

Since the interrupt routine is executed 60 times per second, you will
not be able to keep the motor bit set to keep the motor on if no
buttons are pushed.  Likewise, if you try to turn the motor off when a
button is pressed and this location is set to 0, the interrupt routine
will turn it back on.

To control the motor via software, you must set this location to a
nonzero value after one of the buttons on the recorder has been
pressed.
