Character Under Cursor

The cursor is formed by printing the inverse of the character that
occupies the cursor position.  If that characters is the letter A, for
example, the flashing cursor merely alternates between printing an A
and a reverse-A.  This location keeps track of the normal screen code
of the character that is located at the cursor position, so that it
may be restored when the cursor moves on.
