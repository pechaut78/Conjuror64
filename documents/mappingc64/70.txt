Number of Open I/O Files/Index to the End of File Tables

The number of currently open I/O files is stored here.  The maximum
number that can be open at one time is ten.  The number stored here is
used as the index to the end of the tables that hold the file numbers,
device numbers, and secondary address numbers (see locations 601-631
($259-$277) for more information about these tables).

CLOSE decreases this number and removes entries from the tables
referred to above, while OPEN increases it and adds the appropriate
information to the end of the tables.  The Kernal routine CLALL closes
all files by setting this number to 0, which effectively empties the
table.
