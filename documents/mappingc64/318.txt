address         $B7AD          VAL
Perform VAL

The VAL routine obtains the string pointer, and reads the string one
character at a time until an invalid character is found (ASCII
numbers, sign character, a single decimal point, exponent, and spaces
are all valid).  Then the string is changed to floating point.  If no
valid characters are found, a 0 is returned.
