Function Dispatch Vector Table

This table contains two-byte vectors, each of which points to the
address of one of the routines that performs a BASIC function.

A function is distinguished by a following argument, in parentheses.
The expression in the parentheses is first evaluated by the routines
which begin at 44446 ($AD9E).  Then this table is used to find the
address of the function that corresponds to the token number of the
function to be executed.

The substance of this table, which can be used for locating the
addresses of these routines, is reproduced below.  Note that the
address for the USR function is 784 ($310), which is the address of
the JMP instruction which precedes the user-supplied vector.
