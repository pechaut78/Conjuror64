Timers A and B Low and High Bytes

These four timer registers (two for each timer) have different
functions depending on whether you are reading from them or writing to
them.  When you read from these registers, you get the present value
of the Timer Counter (which counts down from its initial value to 0).
When you write data to these registers, it is stored in the Timer
Latch, and from there it can be used to load the Timer Counter using
the Force Load bit of Control Register A or B (see 56334-5 ($DC0E-F)
below).

These interval timers can hold a 16-bit number from 0 to 65535, in
normal 6510 low-byte, high-byte format (VALUE=LOW BYTE+256*HIGH BYTE).
Once the Timer Counter is set to an initial value, and the timer is
started, the timer will count down one number every microprocessor
clock cycle.  Since the clock speed of the 64 (using the American NTSC
television standard) is 1,022,730 cycles per second, every count takes
approximately a millionth of a second.  The formula for calculating
the amount of time it will take for the timer to count down from its
latch value to 0 is:

TIME=LATCH VALUE/CLOCK SPEED

where LATCH VALUE is the value written to the low and high timer
registers (LATCH VALUE=TIMER LOW+256*TIMER HIGH), and CLOCK SPEED is
1,022,370 cycles per second for American (NTSC) standard television
monitors, or 985,250 for European (PAL) monitors.

When Timer Counter A or B gets to 0, it will set Bit 0 or 1 in the
Interrupt Control Register at 56333 ($DC0D).  If the timer interrupt
has been enabled (see 56333 ($DC0D)), an IRQ will take place, and the
high bit of the Interrupt Control Register will be set to 1.
Alternately, if the Port B output bit is set, the timer will write
data to Bit 6 or 7 of Port B.  After the timer gets to 0, it will
reload the Timer Latch Value, and either stop or count down again,
depending on whether it is in one-shot or continuous mode (determined
by Bit 3 of the Control Register).

Although usually a timer will be used to count the microprocessor
cycles, Timer A can count either the microprocessor clock cycles or
external pulses on the CTN line, which is connected to pin 4 of the
User Port.

Timer B is even more versatile.  In addition to these two sources,
Timer B can count the number of times that Timer A goes to 0.  By
setting Timer A to count the microprocessor clock, and setting Timer B
to count the number of times that Timer A zeros, you effectively link
the two timers into one 32-bit timer that can count up to 70 minutes
with accuracy within 1/15 second.

In the 64, CIA #1 Timer A is used to generate the interrupt which
drives the routine for reading the keyboard and updating the software
clock.  Both Timers A and B are also used for the timing of the
routines that read and write tape data.  Normally, Timer A is set for
continuous operation, and latched with a value of 149 in the low byte
and 66 in the high byte, for a total Latch Value of 17045.  This means
that it is set to count to 0 every 17045/1022730 seconds, or
approximately 1/60 second.

For tape reads and writes, the tape routines take over the IRQ
vectors.  Even though the tape write routines use the on-chip I/O port
at location 1 for the actual data output to the cassette, reading and
writing to the cassette uses both CIA #1 Timer A and Timer B for
timing the I/O routines.
