RS-232: Mock 6551 Control Register

This location is used to control the RS-232 serial I/O baud rate
(speed at which data is transmitted and received), the word length
(number of bits per data character), and the number of stop bits used
to mark the end of a transmitted character.  It uses the same format
as that of the 6551 UART control register to set these parameters,
although, as you will see, some of the 6551 configurations are not
implemented by the software that emulates the UART device.  For
example, the standard baud rates which are higher than 2400 baud are
not implemented, presumably because the software cannot keep up at
higher rates.  The meanings of the various bit patterns are as
follows:

Bit 7: STOP Bits
0    (bit value of 0)   = 1 STOP Bit
1    (bit value of 128) = 0 STOP Bits

Bits 6-5: WORD LENGTH
00   (bit value of 0)   = 8 DATA Bits
01   (bit value of 32)  = 7 DATA Bits
10   (bit value of 64)  = 6 DATA Bits
11   (bit value of 96)  = 5 DATA Bits

Bit 4: Unused

Bits 3-0: BAUD RATE
0000 (bit value of 0)   = Nonstandard (User-Defined) Rate (Not Implemented)
0001 (bit value of 1)   = 50 Baud
0010 (bit value of 2)   = 75 Baud
0011 (bit value of 3)   = 110 Baud
0100 (bit value of 4)   = 134.5 Baud
0101 (bit value of 5)   = 150 Baud
0110 (bit value of 6)   = 300 Baud
0111 (bit value of 7)   = 600 Baud
1000 (bit value of 8)   = 1200 Baud
1001 (bit value of 9)   = 1800 Baud
1010 (bit value of 10)  = 2400 Baud
1011 (bit value of 11)  = 3600 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)
1100 (bit value of 12)  = 4800 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)
1101 (bit value of 13)  = 7200 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)
1110 (bit value of 14)  = 9600 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)
1111 (bit value of 15)  = 19200 Baud (Not Implemented on the Commodore 64)

This register is the only one which must be set when opening RS-232
device (number 2).  The first character of the filename will be stored
here.  For example, the statement OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(6+32) will set the
value of this location to 38.  As you can see from the above chart,
this sets up the RS-232 device for a data transfer rate of 300 baud,
using seven data bits per character and one stop bit.
