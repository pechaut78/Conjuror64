VIC-II Color Register

Although these color registers are used for various purposes, all of
them have one thing in common.  Like the Color RAM Nybbles, only the
lower four bits are connected.  Therefore, when reading these
registers, you must mask out the upper four bits (that is,
BORDERCOLOR=PEEK(53280)AND15) in order to get a true reading.
