Output a Byte

This is a documented Kernal routine whose jump table entry point is at
65490 ($FFD2).  The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 806 ($326).
It is probably one of the best known and most used Kernal routines,
because it sends the character in the Accumulator to the current
output device.  Unless a device has been OPENed and designated as the
current output channel using the CHKOUT routine, the character is
printed to the screen, which is the default output device.  If the
cassette is the current device, outputting a byte will only add it to
the buffer.  No actual transmission of data will occur until the
192-byte buffer is full.
