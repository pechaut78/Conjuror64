List of Keywords

This table contains a complete list of the reserved BASIC keywords
(those combinations of ASCII text characters that cause BASIC to do
something).  The ASCII text characters of these words are stored in
token number order.  Bit #7 of the last letter of each word is set to
indicate the end of the word (the last letter has 128 added to its
true ASCII value).

When the BASIC program text is stored, this list of words is used to
reduce any keywords to a single-byte value called a token.  The
command PRINT, for example, is not stored in a program as five ASCII
bytes, but rather as the single token 153 ($99).

When the BASIC program is listed, this table is used to convert these
tokens back to ASCII text.  The entries in this table consist of the
following:

1.  The statements found in STMDSP at 40972 ($A00C), in the token
number order indicated (token numbers 128-162).

2.  Some miscellaneous keywords which never begin a BASIC statement:

Token #    Keyword
162 $A3    TAB(
164 $A4    TO
165 $A5    FN
166 $A6    SPC(
167 $A7    THEN
168 $A8    NOT
169 $A9    STEP

3.  The math operators found in OPTAB at 41088 ($A080), in the token
number order indicated (token numbers 170-179).

4.  The functions found in FUNDSP at 41042 ($A052), in the token
number order indicated (token numbers 182-202).

5.  The word GO (token number 203 ($CB)).  This word was added to the
table to make the statement GO TO legal, to afford some compatibility
with the very first PET BASIC, which allowed spaces within keywords.

ASCII Text of BASIC Error Messages

This table contains the ASCII text of all of the BASIC error messages.
As in the keyword table, Bit 7 of the last letter of each message is
set to indicate the end of the message.  Although we've all seen some
of them at one time or another, it's somewhat daunting to see the
whole list at once.  The possible errors you can make include:

 1.  TOO MANY FILES
 2.  FILE OPEN
 3.  FILE NOT OPEN
 4.  FILE NOT FOUND
 5.  DEVICE NOT PRESENT
 6.  NOT INPUT FILE
 7.  NOT OUTPUT FILE
 8.  MISSING FILENAME
 9.  ILLEGAL DEVICE NUMBER
10.  NEXT WITHOUT FOR
11.  SYNTAX
12.  RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB
13.  OUT OF DATA
14.  ILLEGAL QUANTITY
15.  OVERFLOW
16.  OUT OF MEMORY
17.  UNDEF'D STATEMENT
18.  BAD SUBSCRIPT
19.  REDIM'D ARRAY
20.  DIVISION BY ZERO
21.  ILLEGAL DIRECT
22.  TYPE MISMATCH
23.  STRING TOO LONG
24.  FILE DATA
25.  FORMULA TOO COMPLEX
26.  CAN'T CONTINUE
27.  UNDEF'D FUNCTION
28.  VERIFY
29.  LOAD

Message number 30, BREAK, is located in the Miscellaneous Messages
table below.

This table contains the two-byte address of the first letter of each
of the 30 error messages.

Miscellaneous Messages

The text of some of the other messages that BASIC can give you is
stored here.  This text includes cursor movement characters, and each
message ends with a 0 character.  The messages are:

1) Carriage return, OK, carriage return
2) Space, space, ERROR
3) Space, IN, space
4) Carriage return, linefeed, READY., carraige return, linefeed
5) Carriage return, linefeed, BREAK
