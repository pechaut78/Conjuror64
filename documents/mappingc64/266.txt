Evaluate Expression

This is the beginning point of a very powerful group of subroutines
which are used extensively by BASIC.

The main purpose of these routines is to read in the ASCII text of
BASIC expressions, separate the operators and terms of the expression,
check them for errors, combine the individual terms by performing the
indicated operations, and obtain a single value which the BASIC
program can use.

This can be a very complex task, and expressions an be of the string
or numeric type, and can contain any type of variable, as well as
constants.

At the end, the flag which shows whether the resulting value is string
or numeric at 13 ($D) is set, and if the value is numeric, the flag at
14 ($E) is set as well, to show if it is an integer or floating point
numer.
