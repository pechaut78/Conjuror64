address  $D000-$DFFF

This 4K block of memory is used for several key functions.  Normally,
the 6510 microprocessor addresses the two Complex Interface Adapter
(CIA) Input/Output chips here, along with the VIC-II video controller
chip, the Sound Interface Device (SID) music synthesizer, and the
Color RAM.

Alternatively, the 6510 can address the character ROM here (though
normally only the VIC-II chip has access to it).  Finally, there is
also 4K of RAM here, although to use it may require banking it in only
when necessary, as the I/O devices are needed for such niceties as
reading he keyboard, and updating the screen display.

It will appear from the map of the I/O devices below that many of the
locations are not accounted for.  That is beause these devices tie up
more addressing space than they actually use.  Each of them uses only
a few addresses, mostly on the bit level.

The missing addresses either consist of images of the hardware
registers, or cannot be addressed in this configuration.  In addition,
some address space is left open for the use of future hardware devices
which might be plugged into the expansion port, like the CP/M card.

As mentioned above, memory usage by these I/O devices is to intensive
that to work with them often requires that you turn individual bits on
and off.  Here is a quick reminder of how to manipulate bits.

The bit values for each bit are:

Bit 0 = 1
Bit 1 = 2
Bit 2 = 4
Bit 3 = 8
Bit 4 = 16
Bit 5 = 32
Bit 6 = 64
Bit 7 = 128

To set a bit to 1 from BASIC, POKE address, PEEK(address) OR Bitvalue.
To reset a bit to 0 from BASIC, POKE address, PEEK(address) AND
255-Bitvalue.
