Filter Resonance Control Register

Bit 0:  Filter the output of voice 1?  1=yes
Bit 1:  Filter the output of voice 2?  1=yes
Bit 2:  Filter the output of voice 3?  1=yes
Bit 3:  Filter the output from the external input?  1=yes
Bits 4-7:  Select filter resonance 0-15

Bits 0-3 are used to control which of the voices will be altered by
the filters.  If one of these bits is set to 1, the corresponding
voice will be processed through the filter, and its harmonic content
will be changed accordingly.  If the bit is set to 0, the voice will
pass directly to the audio output.  Note that there is also a
provision for processing an external audio signal which is brought
through pin 5 of the Audio/Video Port.

Bits 4-7 control the resonance of the filter.  By placing a number
from 0 to 15 in these four bits, you may peak the volume of those
frequencies nearest the cutoff.  This creates an even sharper
filtering effect.  A setting of 0 causes no resonance, while a setting
of 15 gives maximum resonance.
