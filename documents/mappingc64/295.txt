Perform POS

The POS command calls the Kernal PLOT routine (58634, $E50A) to get
the position of the cursor on the logical line.  What it really does
is an equivalent of PEEK(211).  Remember, since we are dealing with a
logical line, this number can be over 39.  The statement "THIS
SENTENCE IS LONGER THAN ONE PHYSICAL LINE";POS(X) will return a value
of 48 for the POS(X).
