C64 Basic Free Memory
This function is used to determine how much memory is avail-
able for use by BASIC. Your Commodore 64 gets its name
from the fact that it has 64K of memory. K, a computer term
for measuring groups of memory units, is similar in use to the
word dozen, which stands for 12 units. One K is used to indi
cate 1024 units. The computer has 64*1024, or 65536, units of
memory. This is why the POKE locations are limited to the
range 0 to 65535. (Remember that we count memory units be
ginning with zero.)
Some of these locations are reserved for the special com
puter chips that handle graphics, sound, and other operations.
More locations are reserved for the system software, including
the BASIC language which accounts for 8K of the locations.
After all of these reserved areas are provided for, there are
about 38K memory locations remaining. This memory is called
free memory, which means it can be used to hold program
information.
As a program gets longer and longer, more of this free
memory is used up. The free memory function, FRE, is used to
determine just how much memory remains. Type the follow
ing line to see how the function works.
PRINT FRE(O)
If the number printed is negative, a small adjustment
must be made to get the correct value.
PRINT FRE(0)+65536
When you turn on your Commodore 64, a message is dis
played which reads something like 38911 BASIC BYTES
FREE. A byte is another name for one memory unit, so you
could say that the computer has 64K bytes of memory, and
about 38K bytes which can be used for a BASIC program.
These bytes are used for things like program lines and vari
ables. A variable takes up seven bytes of free memory. To ver-
ify this, choose a new variable name, one that you haven't yet
given a value. Print the amount of free memory, assign a value
to the variable for the first time, and print the free memory
byte count again.
