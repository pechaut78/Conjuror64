C64 Basic:
• The use of a variable name after NEXT is optional but
recommended, because it helps catch errors which otherwise
might go unnoticed and cause problems later in the program.
• Jumping out of an unfinished FOR-NEXT loop can create
problems that may not be immediately detected. Always
allow FOR-NEXT loops to go to completion. If it is necessary
to jump out of a loop, do not use FOR and NEXT. Instead,
use assignment statements and conditional logic.
• The counting variable retains its value after a FOR-NEXT
loop has ended.
