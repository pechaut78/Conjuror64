C64 Basic:
Several functions are available for use with character strings.
The three functions introduced in this section are LEN, ASC,
and CHR$.
• The LEN and ASC functions require a string for an argu
ment and return a number. This is reversed for CHR$, which
needs a number for an argument and returns a string. The
presence of the $ at the end of the function name indicates
that the function returns a character string.
• The LEN function is used to count the number of characters
in a string. The range of this function is 0 to 255, with 0
being the length of the null string.
• The ASC function returns the ASCII code for the first
character in a string. The string must not be the null string,
or the ILLEGAL QUANTITY error will be printed. ASC is
often used to check input characters. The special function
keys have ASCII codes which can be detected by this
function.
• The CHR$ function takes an ASCII code and returns a string
one character long, the character of the given ASCII code. A
common use for this function is to print the double quote
character. It also simplifies the printing of special control
codes, such as those for screen clearing and color changing.
