C64 Basic
The END statement causes the computer to stop executing a
program, and return to the immediate mode.
• The syntax for the END statement consists only of the
keyword END.
• A program automatically ends after the last line has been
executed, so there is no real need to put an END as the last
line. Using END in this way is a formality, not a necessity.
• END can be placed on a line by itself, or after other state
ments on a line. This is often done in conjunction with the
IF-THEN statement. It is sometimes desirable for a program
to end early, such as when a potential error has been detected.
• Statements placed after an END statement on the same line
will never be executed.
