C64 basic variables
All variables have an initial, or default, value of 0.
• Variables are assigned new values with a LET statement.
• The syntax for the LET statement is the keyword LET, a
variable name, an equal sign, and a number or expression.
• During execution of a LET statement, the value to the right
of the equal sign is determined first, and then it is assigned
to the variable specified to the left of the equal sign.
• Variables can be used just like numbers.
• The LET statement does not cause anything to be printed on
the screen.
