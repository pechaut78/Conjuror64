C64 Basic:
Summary
• The arithmetic operators cannot be used with character
strings, but the plus sign, which indicates addition when used
with numbers, means concatenate when used with strings.
• When two strings are concatenated, the second string is
appended to the end of the first one, in left-to-right order,
forming a longer string.
• The maximum length for a string is 255 characters. Attempt
ing to make a character string longer than this limit causes
the STRING TOO LONG error to be printed.
• All of the relational operators can be used with strings,
including combinations such as < = .
• The conditions less than and greater than depend on the
alphabetical ordering of the characters in the strings. A
comparison is made on the first character of each string. If
the first characters are equal, checking will continue to sub
sequent characters until two are found which are not equal.
• If one string runs out of characters before unequal characters
are found, the longer string is greater.
• The null string is always less than any other string.
• None of the logical operators can be used directly with
character strings.
• With any operator, the two operands must be of the same
type, or the TYPE MISMATCH error will occur.
