C64 Basic:
To print more than one value on a line, separate the items to
be printed with a comma or semicolon.
• A semicolon is used for close spacing, and a comma is used
for far spacing.
• The far spacing of the comma can be used to print numbers
in columns.
• If output exceeds the length of one line, printing will wrap
around to the next line.
• If a PRINT statement ends with a comma or semicolon, the
computer will not print the RETURN, and the cursor will not
move.
