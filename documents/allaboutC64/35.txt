C64 Basic:
• Commodore 64 BASIC supports a second kind of variable
besides the numeric variable used exclusively in previous
chapters. The new kind of variable is called a string variable.
• The two kinds of variables are used to contain different
types of values. A numeric variable has a value of the type
number. A string variable has a value of the type character
string.
• To distinguish between the two types of variables, string
variable names end with a $ symbol. Otherwise, all the other
rules about variable names apply, including the rule about
two significant characters.
• Variable names used for numeric variables have no effect on
names used for string variables. The numeric variable C and
the string variable C$ are entirely different things.
• A null string is a string which consists of no characters.
