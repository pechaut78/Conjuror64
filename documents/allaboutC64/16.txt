C64 Basic:
• When a program line is placed in memory for deferred exe
cution, the cursor moves to the next line, but no READY
prompt is printed.
• The LIST command is used to print every line currently in
the program.
• Line numbers must be integers in the range from 0 to 63999.
Any other numbers cause the SYNTAX ERROR to be
printed.
• The line number is used only to indicate the position in the
program in which a line is to be placed. A line numbered 10
is not necessarily the tenth line in a program.
• The computer ignores unused line numbers.
