C64 Basic:
A variable is cleared when it is reset to its initial value of 0.
• The statement CLR is used to clear all variables. Every vari- *—'
able is set to 0 by the CLR statement.
• The syntax for CLR consists only of the keyword CLR. Un
like PRINT, POKE, or LET, no numbers are needed in the
statement.
