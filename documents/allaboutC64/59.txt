C64 Basic:
• If an array is one-dimensional, only one number will be
inside the DIM statement parentheses, and only one number
will be needed to form a subscript.
• A two-dimensional array requires two numbers in the DIM
statement and subscript. These arrays are often thought of
in terms of rows and columns.
• Arrays of more than two dimensions are possible.
-  If a subscript contains too few or too many numbers for the
dimension of an array, or if a subscript number exceeds the
maximum number specified in the DIM statement, the BAD
SUBSCRIPT error will occur.
