"What function is used to replace a character in a string in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, changing a character in a string requires using LEFTS and RIGHTS functions with concatenation. The LEFTS function returns a specified number of characters from the left side of a string, while the RIGHTS function returns a specified number of characters from the right side of a string. By using these functions, you can replace a character in a string by concatenating the left part of the string, the new character, and the right part of the string."
"What is the minimum number of arguments required for the MID$ function in C64 Basic?","The MID$ function in C64 Basic needs at least two arguments. The second argument tells how far into the string the substring starts."
"What is the purpose of the optional third argument in the MID$ function in C64 Basic?","The optional third argument in the MID$ function in C64 Basic specifies the length of the substring. If the third argument is not provided, the substring continues to the end of the string."
"What happens if the third argument is not provided in the MID$ function in C64 Basic?","If the third argument is not provided in the MID$ function in C64 Basic, the substring continues to the end of the string."
"What is the maximum length of the substring returned by the MID$ function in C64 Basic?","The MID$ function in C64 Basic will not return a string longer than the original string."
"What error message is displayed if too many string functions are nested in C64 Basic?","Nesting of too many string functions in C64 Basic results in the FORMULA TOO COMPLEX error."
"What is the effect of using the LEFTS and RIGHTS functions with concatenation in C64 Basic?","Using the LEFTS and RIGHTS functions with concatenation in C64 Basic allows you to replace a character in a string or extract a substring from a string."
"What is the maximum number of arguments that can be used in the MID$ function in C64 Basic?","The MID$ function in C64 Basic needs at least two arguments and has an optional third argument. Therefore, the maximum number of arguments that can be used in the MID$ function in C64 Basic is three."
"What is the effect of using the MID$ function without the third argument in C64 Basic?","If the third argument is not provided in the MID$ function in C64 Basic, the substring continues to the end of the string."
"What is the effect of using too many string functions in a single statement in C64 Basic?","Nesting of too many string functions in C64 Basic results in the FORMULA TOO COMPLEX error."
