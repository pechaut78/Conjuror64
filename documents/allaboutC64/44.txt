C64 Basic:
• A subroutine is a sequence of statements that occurs once in
a program, but is executed from several places in the
program.
• The purpose of using a subroutine is to avoid duplicating
statement sequences in a program.
• The statements used to implement subroutines are GOSUB
(go to subroutine) and RETURN (return to main program).
• The syntax for the GOSUB statement is the keyword
GOSUB followed by a line number. The RETURN statement
consists only of the keyword RETURN.
• The GOSUB statement makes execution jump to the begin
ning of the specified line. If the specified line does not exist,
an UNDEFD STATEMENT error will occur.
• The main difference between GOSUB and GOTO is that
with GOSUB, the computer remembers where execution
stopped in the main program.
