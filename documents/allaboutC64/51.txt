C64 Basic:
• When the NEXT statement checks if the value of the count
ing variable is still in range, it checks not just for equality,
but also for less than. This means that the counting variable
does not have to exactly match the ending value for the loop
to end.
• With a positive step value, the NEXT statement will repeat
the loop if the counting variable is less than or equal to the
loop's ending value. For a negative step value, a check for
greater than or equal to is used.
• All of the statements in a FOR-NEXT loop will be executed
once before the NEXT statement is ever reached. This means
that even if the starting and ending values in a FOR state
ment are wrong, as in FOR K=l TO -1 (no STEP -1), the
loop will be executed at least once.
• There is no sense in using a step value of 0, because doing
so creates an infinite loop.
• Any number of independent FOR-NEXT loops can be used
in one program.
