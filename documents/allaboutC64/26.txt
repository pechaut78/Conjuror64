C64 Basic
• If your program enters an infinite loop, execution can be
aborted at any time by pressing the RUN/STOP key.
• The GOTO statement makes the computer jump to the
beginning of the new line. Execution starts with the first
statement on the line.
• You should not put statements after a GOTO on the same
line, because they will never be executed.
The syntax for this statement is the keyword GOTO and a
line number. A number must be used; variables and
expressions are not valid.
• An alternate spelling for the name of the GOTO statement is
GO TO.
• If an attempt is made to GOTO a line which is not in the j_J
program, or if a variable is used instead of a line number,
the UNDEFD STATEMENT error will occur, which means
that the referenced line is undefined.
