C64 Basic:
• There are many advantages to using FOR and NEXT to
create loops:
1. Only two statements are needed.
2. The FOR statement indicates right away how many times
the loop will repeat.
3. The boundaries of a loop defined using FOR and NEXT
are easy to spot, especially if the variable name is put
after NEXT.
4. Because the NEXT statement can jump into the middle of
a line, an entire loop can be written on just one line.
5. It is possible to perform a FOR-NEXT loop in the immedi
ate mode.
• Although the value of the counting variable should never be
changed while it is in the middle of a loop, the value can be
used by other statements in the loop.
• If the STEP keyword is omitted in the FOR statement, a
stepping value of 1 is assumed.
• To make the counting variable count backward, a negative
step value has to be used.
