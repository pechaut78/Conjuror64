"What is a subroutine in C64 Basic and how can multiple subroutines be used in one program?","A subroutine in C64 Basic is a block of code that can be called and executed from multiple places in a program. Several subroutines can be used in one program by defining them and calling them whenever needed. This allows for code reuse and modularity."
"What happens when one subroutine calls another subroutine in C64 Basic?","When one subroutine calls another subroutine in C64 Basic, the subroutines are nested. This means that the called subroutine is executed before the calling subroutine continues its execution."
"What is required for nested subroutines to work without creating a RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB error in C64 Basic?","In order for nested subroutines to work without creating a RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB error in C64 Basic, exactly one RETURN must be executed for every GOSUB executed. This ensures that each subroutine call is properly closed before the program continues."
"What is the maximum nesting limit for subroutines in C64 Basic and what error occurs when this limit is exceeded?","The Commodore 64 cannot nest deeper than 23 levels. Nesting beyond this limit causes the OUT OF MEMORY error."
"What is recursion in C64 Basic and when is it best avoided?","Recursion in C64 Basic is when a subroutine calls itself. It is best avoided for our purposes as it can lead to issues such as stack overflow and make the code harder to understand and debug."
"What is a RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB error in C64 Basic and how can it be avoided?","A RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB error in C64 Basic occurs when there is a RETURN statement without a corresponding GOSUB statement. This can be avoided by ensuring that exactly one RETURN is executed for every GOSUB executed in nested subroutines."
"What is the purpose of the GOSUB statement in C64 Basic and how is it used?","The GOSUB statement in C64 Basic is used to call a subroutine. It transfers the program control to the subroutine and when the subroutine is finished, the program control is returned to the statement following the GOSUB statement."
"What is the purpose of the RETURN statement in C64 Basic and how is it used?","The RETURN statement in C64 Basic is used to return the program control from a subroutine to the statement following the GOSUB statement. It must be used exactly once for every GOSUB executed in nested subroutines to avoid a RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB error."
"What is the maximum nesting limit for subroutines in C64 Basic and what happens when this limit is exceeded?","The maximum nesting limit for subroutines in C64 Basic is 23 levels. Exceeding this limit causes the OUT OF MEMORY error."
"What is recursion in C64 Basic and why is it best avoided for our purposes?","Recursion in C64 Basic is when a subroutine calls itself. It is best avoided for our purposes as it can lead to issues such as stack overflow and make the code harder to understand and debug."
