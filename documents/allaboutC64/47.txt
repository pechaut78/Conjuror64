C64 Basic:
-Several subroutines can be used in one program.
• When one subroutine calls another subroutine, the sub-
routines are nested,
• In order for nested subroutines to work without creating a
RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB error, exactly one RETURN
must be executed for every GOSUB executed.
• The Commodore 64 cannot nest deeper than 23 levels. Nest-
ing beyond this limit causes the OUT OF MEMORY error.
• The third form of repetition, recursion, happens when a sub
routine calls itself. For our purposes, recursion is best
avoided.
