C64 basic:
• Variables are independent, so assigning a value to one vari
able does not affect the values of other variables.
• There is no reason why two variables can't have the same
value, even though the variables are independent.
• A variable keeps its value until it is assigned a new one.
• A variable can have only one value at a time.
• Numbers cannot be assigned new values.
