C64 basic:
PRINT is a versatile statement used to output information to
the screen.
• If a value is placed after the keyword, it will be printed be-
ginning at the place on the screen currently pointed to by
the cursor.
• After a PRINT statement is executed, the computer prints a
RETURN, which moves the cursor back to the left edge and
down one row.
• If no value is specified after the PRINT keyword, the auto-
matic RETURN leaves a blank line on the screen.
