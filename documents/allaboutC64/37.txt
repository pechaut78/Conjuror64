C64 Basic:
In general, the three distinguishing characteristics of a vari
able are its name, value, and type.
• The availability of string variables makes the GET statement
much more useful. GET will assign the indicated string vari
able the null value if no key is pressed. Otherwise, a single
character will be assigned, according to the key pressed.
The INPUT statement is used to input strings longer than
one character.
• Pressing RETURN only in response to an input prompt of ?
does not change the value of the variable being assigned. But
entering nothing for ?? causes all unassigned string variables
in the variable list to be assigned the null string.
• String variables can also be included in the variable list for
READ.
• The quote marks that delimit a character string are optional
when used in DATA statements. The only time that they
have to be used is when the string includes a comma or
colon as one of its characters.
