C64 BASIC:
When a line is executed as soon as it is typed, the computer
is operating in the immediate or direct mode.
• When the computer executes a program, it is said to be
operating in the deferred or program mode.
• If a number is placed at the beginning of a line, the com
puter will not execute it immediately, but instead will place
it in computer memory as a program line. A program is a se
quence of numbered lines.
• The position of a line in a program is determined by the
value of the number at the beginning of the line.
