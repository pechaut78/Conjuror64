C64 Basic:
Conditional logic is implemented  by means
of the IF-THEN statement.
• The syntax for the IF-THEN statement is the keyword IF, a
conditional expression, a second keyword THEN, and a
statement.
• The conditional expression can be any mathematical phrase.
• Any statement may be placed after the THEN, even another
IF-THEN statement.
The statement after the THEN is executed if the conditional
expression is true. If it is false, nothing happens. All of the
statements on the rest of the line are ignored. No error mes-
sage is printed.
• A missing THEN keyword causes a SYNTAX ERROR (see
GOTO exception above)
• The IF-THEN statement controls the execution of statements
within a line.
