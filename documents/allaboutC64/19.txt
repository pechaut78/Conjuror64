C64 Basic:
• To move a line from one place in the program to another,
type the line using the new line number, and delete the old
line.
• A line can also be moved by using the editing keys, list the
line, position the cursor on top of the line number, type the
new line number, and press RETURN. You must still delete
the old line, though.
• A fast way to erase a program is to use the NEW command,
which deletes every line in the program, and clears all vari
ables at the same time.
• Variables retain their values after a program has stopped
executing.
• Variables are cleared as soon as the program is modified in
any way.
• The RUN command also automatically clears all variables
before program execution starts.
• Errors in a program line are detected only when the line is
executed, not when the line is entered and placed in
memory.
