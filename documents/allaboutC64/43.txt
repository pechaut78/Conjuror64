C64 Basic:
• Changing a character in a string requires using LEFTS and
RIGHTS with concatenation.
• The MID$ function needs at least two arguments. The sec
ond argument tells how far into the string the substring
starts. The optional third argument specifies the length of
the substring. If the third argument is not provided, the
substring continues to the end of the string.
• These functions may return the null string as the substring.
They will not return a string longer than the original string.
• Nesting of too many string functions results in the FOR
MULA TOO COMPLEX error.
