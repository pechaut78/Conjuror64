C64 Basic:
• Subroutines are usually put after the main program. An
END statement is needed to separate the main program from
the subroutine. Having a main program accidentally fall into
a subroutine is a sure way of getting the RETURN
WITHOUT GOSUB error.
• When execution is transferred to a subroutine, it is said that
the subroutine has been called.
• To make a subroutine more flexible, it can use a variable
that is assigned just before the subroutine is called.
• The entry point of a subroutine is the line to which execution
jumps when the subroutine is called. Subroutines can have
more than one entry point.
