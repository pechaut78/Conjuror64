C64 Basic
 The GOTO statement changes the order in which program
lines are executed.
• Normally, after the computer executes one line, it will exe
cute the next one in the sequence. The GOTO statement
causes execution to jump to a different line.
• GOTO can move execution forward or backward in the
program.
• When GOTO is used to skip backward so that lines can be
executed again, the lines that are repeated form a loop.
If these lines are executed continuously, without ever
stopping, the loop is called an infinite loop.
