C64 Basic:
• Using two commas together can make the computer assume
a default value of 0 for one of the variables, so caution is
advised.
• The only way to abort a program while an INPUT statement
is being executed is to press RUN/STOP and RESTORE.
• The INPUT statement can be used only in the program
mode, not in the immediate mode.
