C64 Basic:
• Programs can be stored on cassette tape or floppy disks with
the SAVE command, and retrieved later by using the LOAD
command.
• The SAVE command stores a copy of the program in mem
ory onto tape or disk. The program is still in memory after
a SAVE command is used.
• The syntax for SAVE is the keyword SAVE followed by a
character string which is called a filename. When saving to
the disk drive, a comma and device number of 8 (a second
drive would be device number 9) must be put after the
character string.
• The LOAD command copies a program from tape or disk
back into the computer's memory. Any program that was
already in memory is erased when the new program is
loaded.
• The syntax for LOAD is the keyword LOAD, the filename, 
and a comma and device number of 8 if the disk drive is 
being used.
