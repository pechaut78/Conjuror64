C64 Basic:
To avoid the problem of GOTO forming an infinite loop,
conditional logic must be used. The combination of IF-THEN
with GOTO is one way to achieve this.
• A variable can be used in a LET statement such as A=A+1
to count how many times a loop is executed. A variable used
in this manner is called a counting variable.
• By basing conditional logic on a counting variable, you can
have a program control exactly how many times the loop is
executed.
• Sometimes the value of a counting variable is used within a
loop, so that something is done differently every time a loop
is executed.
• Because it is used so often, there are two short forms to the
IF-THEN and GOTO combination. The first is to make the
GOTO optional, and the second is to make the THEN
optional.
