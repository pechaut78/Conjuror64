C64 Basic
• There are two kinds of loops. One kind repeats indefinitely,
waiting for a condition to be met. The computer does not
know, when it first enters the loop, how many times the
loop will be executed. The other type of loop repeats a set
number of times. In this case, the computer does know
when it enters the loop how many times the loop will be
executed.
• The kind of loop which repeats a set number of times is very
simple, but to implement it in a program requires assignment
statements, conditional logic, and a way to make execution
jump to the top of a loop.
• The FOR and NEXT statements are used to simplify the han
dling of loops which repeat a specified number of times.
These two statements do all the work normally done by two
LET statements and an IF-GOTO statement.
• The syntax of the FOR statement starts with the keyword
FOR. Then comes the name of the counting variable. This
must be a numeric variable. String variables cannot be used.
After the variable name comes an equal sign, just as in the
LET statement, followed by a value which is the starting 
value for the loop. Next comes the keyword TO and another
value, this time the ending value for the loop. All of this
may optionally be followed by the keyword STEP and one 
more value.
