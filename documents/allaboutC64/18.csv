"What happens to a program line when it is stored in memory in C64 Basic?","When a program line is stored in memory in C64 Basic, it is placed exactly as it was typed, with the exception of abbreviations or leading spaces being converted to a single space. The question mark is converted to the keyword PRINT. Only one leading space is placed after the line number, regardless of how many spaces were typed."
"How can a program line be changed in C64 Basic?","A program line can be changed in C64 Basic by typing the same line number and new statements, followed by pressing the RETURN key. Alternatively, the editing keys can be used to move the cursor to a listing of the line to be changed, and the INSert and DELete keys can be used to modify the line. After the changes have been made, the RETURN key must be pressed while the cursor is still on the line."
"What happens when the RETURN key is pressed while the cursor is on a line in C64 Basic?","When the RETURN key is pressed while the cursor is still on a line in C64 Basic, the line is entered into the program. If the line has been modified using the editing keys, the changes will be saved. If the RETURN key is pressed on a deleted line, the line will be retrieved and added back into the program."
"How can a line be deleted in C64 Basic?","A line can be deleted in C64 Basic by typing only the line number and pressing the RETURN key. This will remove the line from the program."
"How can a deleted line be retrieved in C64 Basic?","A deleted line can be retrieved in C64 Basic by retyping the line, or by moving the cursor on top of the line if a listing of the line is still on the screen and pressing the RETURN key. This will add the line back into the program."
"Does a line appearing on the screen in C64 Basic mean it is part of the program?","No, a line appearing on the screen in C64 Basic does not necessarily mean it is part of the program. The line must be added to the program by pressing the RETURN key while the cursor is on the line."
"How are abbreviations handled in C64 Basic when a program line is stored in memory?","Abbreviations are handled by being expanded to their full form when a program line is stored in memory in C64 Basic. For example, the abbreviation for PRINT is the question mark, which is converted to PRINT before the line is stored in memory."
"How are leading spaces handled in C64 Basic when a program line is stored in memory?","Leading spaces are handled by being reduced to a single space when a program line is stored in memory in C64 Basic. This means that if multiple spaces are typed before the line number, only one space will be stored in memory."
"How can the editing keys be used to modify a program line in C64 Basic?","The editing keys can be used to move the cursor to a listing of the line to be changed in C64 Basic, and the INSert and DELete keys can be used to modify the line. After the changes have been made, the RETURN key must be pressed while the cursor is still on the line to save the changes."
"What is the effect of typing only the line number and pressing the RETURN key in C64 Basic?","Typing only the line number and pressing the RETURN key in C64 Basic will delete the line from the program. This can be used to remove a line from the program if it is no longer needed."
