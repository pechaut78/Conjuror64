"What is the purpose of the ON statement in C64 Basic?","The ON statement in C64 Basic is used to perform a GOTO or GOSUB to a line number in a list, based on the integer portion of a numeric value. It is used to get around the problem that line numbers after GOTO or GOSUB cannot be expressions or variables."
"What is the syntax for the ON statement in C64 Basic?","The syntax for the ON statement in C64 Basic is: ON, a numeric value, the keyword GOTO or the keyword GOSUB, and a list of line numbers."
"What happens when the ON statement is executed in C64 Basic?","When the ON statement is executed in C64 Basic, it takes the integer portion of the numeric value, counts that far into the line number list, and then performs a GOTO or GOSUB to that line."
"What happens if the value exceeds the number of line numbers in the list in the ON statement in C64 Basic?","If the value exceeds the number of line numbers in the list in the ON statement in C64 Basic, the statement will be ignored and execution will continue with the next statement."
"What happens if the value is 0 in the ON statement in C64 Basic?","If the value is 0 in the ON statement in C64 Basic, the statement will be ignored and execution will continue with the next statement."
"What error is produced when a negative value is used in the ON statement in C64 Basic?","A negative value produces the ILLEGAL QUANTITY error in the ON statement in C64 Basic."
"Is it possible to use expressions or variables as line numbers after GOTO or GOSUB in C64 Basic?","No, it is not possible to use expressions or variables as line numbers after GOTO or GOSUB in C64 Basic. The ON statement is used to get around this problem."
"What is an example of using the ON statement with GOTO in C64 Basic?","An example of using the ON statement with GOTO in C64 Basic is: ON 3 GOTO 100, 200, 300, which will perform a GOTO to line 200."
"What is an example of using the ON statement with GOSUB in C64 Basic?","An example of using the ON statement with GOSUB in C64 Basic is: ON 2 GOSUB 1000, 2000, 3000, which will perform a GOSUB to line 2000."
"Can the ON statement be used for other purposes besides getting around the problem of line numbers after GOTO or GOSUB in C64 Basic?","No, the ON statement is specifically used for getting around the problem of line numbers after GOTO or GOSUB in C64 Basic, and cannot be used for other purposes."
