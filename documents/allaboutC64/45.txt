C64 Basic:
- Because execution eventually resumes where it left off in the
main program, statements can be placed after a GOSUB on
the same line.
• The RETURN statement causes execution to jump to the first
statement after the most recent GOSUB. This may mean
jumping into the middle of a line. RETURN is comparable
to the END statement of a main program.
• RETURN should be used only when a GOSUB has been
previously executed. If the computer encounters a RETURN
without having previously executed a matching GOSUB, the
place to jump back to is undefined, so a RETURN WITH-
OUT GOSUB error is printed.
• A subroutine can contain several RETURN statements, pro
vided that for every GOSUB executed, exactly one RETURN
is executed.
