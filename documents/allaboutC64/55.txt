C64 Basic:
• There are no restrictions on the line numbers in the list,
other than that no variables or expressions are allowed.
The line numbers do not have to be in increasing order or
increment by the same number, although programmers have
a tendency to use the numbers that way.
• The same line number can be used more than once in the
same list.
• Consecutive commas are counted as meaning that a line
number of 0 is intended. It is not possible to make ON work
with only selected values in a range.
• One ON statement can often replace several IF-THEN state
ments. For this reason the ON statement is considered
another form of conditional logic.
• Sometimes it is necessary to use a couple of ON statements
together, if the line number list is too long. In such a case,
the number of line numbers in the first line must be sub
tracted from the value in the second ON statement.
• Because the ON statement can perform a GOTO or GOSUB,
it will cause the UNDEFD STATEMENT error to be gen
erated when a requested line is not found.
