"What is the default maximum subscript in C64 Basic?","The default maximum subscript in C64 Basic is 10. This means that if you try to access an element of an array using a subscript that is larger than 10, you will get a 'BAD SUBSCRIPT' error."
"What happens if you use a negative subscript in C64 Basic?","Using a negative subscript in C64 Basic will result in an 'ILLEGAL QUANTITY' error. Subscript numbering in C64 Basic starts with 0, so negative subscripts are not allowed."
"What are the default values in an array in C64 Basic?","The default values in an array in C64 Basic are the number 0 and the null string. This means that if you create a new array without specifying any values, it will be filled with these default values."
"What is the advantage of using an array in C64 Basic?","The advantage of using an array in C64 Basic is that it makes it easier to manage a lot of values. Because subscripts can be variables, arrays are ideal for use in loops. This allows you to easily iterate over and manipulate large sets of data."
"What happens if you try to access an element of an array in C64 Basic using a subscript that is too large?","If you try to access an element of an array in C64 Basic using a subscript that is too large, you will get a 'BAD SUBSCRIPT' error. The default maximum subscript in C64 Basic is 10, so if you use a subscript that is larger than 10, you will get this error."
"Can you use negative subscripts in C64 Basic?","No, you cannot use negative subscripts in C64 Basic. If you try to use a negative subscript, you will get an 'ILLEGAL QUANTITY' error. Subscript numbering in C64 Basic starts with 0, so negative subscripts are not allowed."

"What is the default maximum subscript in C64 Basic and what happens if you try to use a subscript that is larger than this?","The default maximum subscript in C64 Basic is 10. If you try to use a subscript that is larger than 10, you will get a 'BAD SUBSCRIPT' error. This means that you cannot access elements of an array using subscripts that are larger than the default maximum subscript."
