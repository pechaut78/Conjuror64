C64 Basic:

• The RESTORE statement resets the data pointer so that
reading will start from the first value in the first DATA
statement of the program. This makes it possible to use
READ in an infinite loop without getting an OUT OF DATA
error.
• It does not matter how much data has already been read
when RESTORE is used. The data pointer will always be
restored to the initial state when the program started running.
• The CLR statement automatically performs a RESTORE.
Because the RUN command does a CLR before starting program execution, RUN also performs a RESTORE.
• The RESTORE statement is used only with READ and
DATA, and even then it's not used very often.
