question,answer
"What is the main action in C64 Basic performed by the READ statement?","The READ statement in C64 Basic is responsible for assigning values to variables. It is the action statement, while the DATA statement simply supplies values for READ."
"What is the purpose of the DATA statement in C64 Basic?","The DATA statement in C64 Basic is used to supply values for the READ statement. The computer ignores the DATA statement unless a READ statement is being executed."
"Where are DATA statements usually placed in a C64 Basic program?","DATA statements are often placed at the end of a C64 Basic program, out of the way of other statements."
"How does C64 Basic determine which values in a DATA statement to assign to variables?","The first value in a DATA statement is the first one that is assigned to a variable. The computer remembers which values in a DATA statement have already been read. If more than one READ statement is executed, the second READ will start with the next value not yet read."
"What happens if there are more READ statements than values in the DATA statements in C64 Basic?","An attempt to assign more values than are available in DATA statements will result in the OUT OF DATA error."
"How does C64 Basic determine which DATA statement to read from first?","If there is more than one DATA statement, reading will start with the one which has the lowest line number. Once all of the values in that statement have been read, future values will be read from the next DATA statement."
"Can the order of values in a DATA statement be changed after they have been read in C64 Basic?","No, the order of values in a DATA statement cannot be changed after they have been read in C64 Basic. The computer remembers which values have already been read."
"What happens if a value is read from a DATA statement that has already been completely read in C64 Basic?","If a value is read from a DATA statement that has already been completely read, the READ statement will not assign a value to a variable and no error will be generated."
"Is it necessary to have a DATA statement for every READ statement in C64 Basic?","No, it is not necessary to have a DATA statement for every READ statement in C64 Basic. The computer will continue reading from the last DATA statement that was used, even if there are no more READ statements."
"What is the OUT OF DATA error in C64 Basic and how can it be avoided?","The OUT OF DATA error in C64 Basic occurs when there are more READ statements than values in the DATA statements. It can be avoided by ensuring that there are enough values in the DATA statements for all of the READ statements."
