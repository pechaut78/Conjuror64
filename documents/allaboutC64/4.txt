C64 Basic:
The first character in a variable name must be alphabetic.
• If a variable name contains more than one character, the
others must be alphanumeric (a letter of the alphabet or a
digit). Spaces are also allowed, but do not count as charac
ters, so it is suggested that they not be used.
• A variable name can be any length, but only the first two
characters are significant.
• It is best to choose a variable name which reflects the pur
pose and use of the variable.
• The computer will generate a SYNTAX ERROR if a variable
name contains a reserved word.
• There are two reserved variables: ST and TI. They cannot be
assigned.
