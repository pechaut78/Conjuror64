"What is the difference between immediate mode and program mode in C64 BASIC?","In C64 BASIC, immediate mode, also known as direct mode, is when a line is executed as soon as it is typed. On the other hand, program mode, also known as deferred mode, is when the computer executes a program, which is a sequence of numbered lines."
"What happens when a number is placed at the beginning of a line in C64 BASIC?","When a number is placed at the beginning of a line in C64 BASIC, the computer will not execute it immediately. Instead, it will place it in computer memory as a program line. The position of a line in a program is determined by the value of the number at the beginning of the line."
"What is a program in C64 BASIC?","In C64 BASIC, a program is a sequence of numbered lines. Each line in a program is stored in computer memory with a unique line number, which determines the position of the line in the program."
"What is the purpose of line numbers in C64 BASIC?","In C64 BASIC, line numbers are used to determine the position of a line in a program. They are placed at the beginning of each line and are used by the interpreter to execute the program in the correct order."
"How does C64 BASIC handle the execution of program lines?","In C64 BASIC, program lines are executed in the order of their line numbers. The interpreter reads each line, starting with the lowest line number, and executes it. If a line contains a syntax error, the interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message."
"What is the difference between executing a line immediately and placing it in memory as a program line in C64 BASIC?","In C64 BASIC, executing a line immediately means that the line is executed as soon as it is typed, without being stored in memory. Placing a line in memory as a program line, on the other hand, means that the line is stored in memory with a unique line number, and will be executed as part of a program."
"How can a sequence of numbered lines be created in C64 BASIC?","In C64 BASIC, a sequence of numbered lines can be created by typing each line with a unique line number at the beginning. The interpreter will store each line in memory, in the order of their line numbers, creating a program."
"What happens when a line is typed in C64 BASIC without a line number?","In C64 BASIC, if a line is typed without a line number, it will be executed immediately, in direct mode. The line will not be stored in memory as part of a program."
"What is the role of the interpreter in C64 BASIC when executing a program?","In C64 BASIC, the interpreter is responsible for executing a program. It reads each line of the program, in the order of their line numbers, and executes them. If a line contains a syntax error, the interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message."
"What is the impact of line numbers in the execution order of a program in C64 BASIC?","In C64 BASIC, line numbers determine the execution order of a program. The interpreter reads each line, starting with the lowest line number, and executes it. If a line contains a syntax error, the interpreter will stop executing the program and display an error message."
