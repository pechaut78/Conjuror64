 Unlike arithmetic and relational operators, which operate on
numbers, the logical operators AND, OR, and NOT operate
on the values true and false.
• The operators AND or OR are called binary operators be
cause they operate on two values. When you place AND or
OR between two conditional expressions, the operator and
expressions form one big expression.
• When using AND, the value of this big expression is true
only when both of the smaller expressions are true. All it
takes is one false value to make the whole expression false.
• When using OR, the value of the big expression is false only
when both of the smaller expressions are false. All it takes is
one true value to make the whole expression true.
• The NOT operator is called a unary operator because it op
erates on only one value. This operator takes a true/false
value and changes it to the opposite value.
• Logical operators have the lowest precedence of all the
operators.
