C64 Basic:
• The syntax for the NEXT statement is the keyword NEXT
and an optional variable list.
• The FOR statement assigns the counting variable its initial
value, and makes the computer remember the end and step
values for the loop.
• The NEXT statement makes sure that if it includes a variable
name, the name matches the variable in the most recent FOR
statement. If there is a mismatch, the NEXT WITHOUT FOR
error message is printed. Otherwise, it adds the step value to
the counting variable, checks if the counting variable is still
in the range specified in the FOR statement, and if so, causes
execution to jump to the first statement after the correspond
ing FOR statement. When that loop is finished, the NEXT
statement checks for more variables in its variable list. If
there is another one, the whole procedure is repeated for
that loop. When there are no more variables, execution
proceeds to the statement after NEXT.
