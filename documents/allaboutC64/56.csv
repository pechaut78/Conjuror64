"What is an array in C64 Basic?","An array in C64 Basic is a group of numbers or character strings that have a common name but can be individually accessed. It is a data structure that allows you to store and manipulate multiple values using a single variable name."
"What are the naming restrictions for array names in C64 Basic?","The same restrictions that apply to a variable name also apply to array names in C64 Basic. This means that array names cannot be the same as any keyword or built-in function, and they must follow the same rules as variable names in terms of length and allowed characters."
"Are array names and variable names the same in C64 Basic?","No, array names are separate from variable names in C64 Basic. This means that you can have both a variable and an array with the same name, as long as you refer to them in the correct context."
"How do you assign one array to another in C64 Basic?","To assign one array to another in C64 Basic, each value in the array must be copied separately. This means that you cannot simply assign one array to another using the '=' operator, but you must instead use a loop or other method to copy each value individually."
"What is a subscript in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, a subscript is a number in parentheses that is placed after the array name to specify one particular value in an array. The subscript is used to index into the array and access or modify the value at that position."
