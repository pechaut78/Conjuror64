C64 Basic:
One PRINT statement can print both numbers and character
strings.
• Commas and semicolons can be used regardless of whether
numbers are mixed with character strings.
• The word type refers to the quality of a value that deter
mines what sort of information is being represented. The two
types that have been introduced thus far are numbers and
character strings.
• Attempts to use the arithmetic operators with character
strings cause the computer to generate a TYPE MISMATCH
error.
