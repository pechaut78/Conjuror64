C64 Basic:
 The syntax for the GET statement is the keyword GET and a
variable list.
• When GET is executed, the computer checks whether a key
has been pressed. If so, the value of that key is assigned to
the indicated variable. This is repeated for each variable in
the list.
• If no key has been pressed, the variable is assigned the
value 0.
The keyboard has a buffer which can store up to ten key
strokes in the order they were entered. Keys are ignored if
pressed after the buffer is full.
• It is good practice to have a program print a prompting mes
sage when keyboard input is needed.
• The GET statement can only be used in the program mode;
an ILLEGAL DIRECT error will be generated if it is used in
the immediate mode.
