C64 Basic:
• The default value for all string variables is the null string.
• The CLR statement sets all string variables to the null string.
• Both types of variables can be used in the same variable list
for PRINT, GET, INPUT, and READ. However, the TYPE
MISMATCH error will be printed if an attempt is made to
incorrectly mix the two types. In any variable assignment,
the value being assigned must be of the same type as the
variable name to which it is assigned.
