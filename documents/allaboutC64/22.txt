C64 Basic:
A filename can be up to 16 characters, all of which are
significant.
• Multiple programs can be stored on tape or disk by using
different filenames. When saving a program to tape, position
the tape right at the end of the last program on the tape. The
disk drive automatically determines where on the disk the
program will be stored.
• It is a dangerous practice to save a revised program to tape
on top of an earlier version, because the next program on
the tape may be overwritten.
• The disk drive will not normally let you save a program
with a filename that is already in use.
• The ILLEGAL DEVICE NUMBER error means that an
attempt was made to use a device which does not support
loading or saving. The only device numbers normally used
are 1 (cassette) and 8 (disk). If a device number is not speci
fied after a filename, the computer assumes that the cassette
is to be used.
• The DEVICE NOT PRESENT error occurs when a referenced
device does not respond to the computer, because it is either
not hooked up or not turned on.
• If you try to load a disk file using a filename that does not
exist, you will get the FILE NOT FOUND error.
• When errors occur on the disk drive, the red light flashes.
• Storage and retrieval commands can be aborted by pressing
the RUN/STOP key.
• LOADing is an input operation, and SAVEing is an output
operation.
• The terms read and write are often used to mean input and
output.
• Care should be exercised in handling cassette tapes and floppy disks. They should not be exposed to radiation, magnets,
temperature changes, or fingers.
• The VERIFY command is used to read a program on tape or
disk and check if it matches the program in memory. If
it doesn't, the VERIFY ERROR message is printed.
• The main difference between the LOAD and VERIFY com
mands is that with VERIFY, the program in memory is not
touched. It is only compared against the program on the tape
or disk.
