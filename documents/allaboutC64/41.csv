"What is the purpose of the VAL function in C64 Basic?","The VAL function in C64 Basic is used to convert a string that contains numeric characters into a numeric value. It ignores any leading spaces and interprets the characters related to numbers until it reaches a character that is not related to numbers. The only characters related to numbers are the ten digits, the plus and minus signs, and the period. If the string is null or starts with a non-numeric character, VAL returns a value of 0."
"What is the effect of leading spaces on the VAL function?","The VAL function in C64 Basic ignores any leading spaces in the string that is being converted. This means that if there are spaces before the numeric characters, they will not affect the resulting numeric value."
"What characters are related to numbers in the VAL function?","The VAL function in C64 Basic recognizes the ten digits (0-9), the plus and minus signs, and the period as characters related to numbers. It uses these characters to interpret the string and convert it into a numeric value."
"What happens if the string starts with a non-numeric character in the VAL function?","If the string being converted by the VAL function starts with a non-numeric character, the function returns a value of 0. This is because the VAL function only recognizes characters related to numbers and cannot interpret non-numeric characters as part of the numeric value."
"What is the purpose of the STR$ function in C64 Basic?","The STR$ function in C64 Basic is used to convert a number into its character representation. This representation includes all the characters that would be used if the number were printed. If the number is positive, the resulting string will start with a space."
"What is the effect of the STR$ function on negative numbers?","The STR$ function in C64 Basic converts negative numbers into their character representation, including the negative sign. For example, if the input is -123, the output will be "-123"."
"What is the difference between the VAL and STR$ functions in C64 Basic?","The VAL function in C64 Basic converts a string into a numeric value, while the STR$ function converts a number into its character representation. VAL is used to avoid the TYPE MISMATCH error when working with mixed data types, while STR$ is used to display numbers as strings."
"What happens if the null string is passed to the VAL function?","If the null string ("") is passed to the VAL function, it returns a value of 0 because there are no numeric characters in the string to interpret."
"What is the maximum number of characters that the VAL function can interpret?","The VAL function in C64 Basic can interpret up to 255 characters in a string. However, it only considers characters related to numbers for the interpretation, and it stops interpreting the string as soon as it encounters a non-numeric character."
"What is the format of the string produced by the STR$ function?","The STR$ function in C64 Basic produces a string that includes all the characters that would be used if the number were printed. If the number is positive, the string will start with a space. For example, if the input is 123.45, the output will be " 123.45"."
