C64 Basic:

• The dimension of an array is the maximum subscript number
that can be used for the array.
• When a program first starts running, or the CLR statement is
executed, all arrays are undimensioned. When an
undimensioned array is accessed for the first time, the array
is dimensioned to a default of 10.
• For those occasions when an array needs to be dimensioned
larger than 10, the DIM statement must be used.
• To save memory, an array can also be DIMensioned smaller
than 11.
• The syntax for the DIM statement is the keyword DIM fol
lowed by an array name list. Each array name in the list
must be followed by parentheses containing the dimension
numbers.
