C64 Basic:
• FOR-NEXT loops can be nested, provided that the NEXT
statements occur in exactly the opposite order of the
corresponding FOR statements.
• An easy way to tell if loops are nested correctly is to draw
lines connecting the FOR and NEXT statements. If the lines
cross, the nesting is wrong, and a NEXT WITHOUT FOR
error message is to be expected.
• The maximum number of FOR-NEXT loops which can be
nested fluctuates, but the absolute maximum is nine levels. A
program won't usually have to nest deeper than that.
• A FOR statement cannot use a counting variable that is cur
rently being used by another FOR-NEXT loop.
