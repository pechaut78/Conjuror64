C64 Basic:
• The READ statement is the one that does all the action. The
variables are assigned when the READ is executed. The
DATA statement just supplies values for READ. The computer ignores the DATA statement unless a READ statement
is being executed. For that reason, DATA statements are
often placed at the end of a program, out of the way of
other statements.
• The first value in a DATA statement is the first one that is
assigned to a variable. The computer remembers which
values in a DATA statement have already been read. If more
than one READ statement is executed, the second READ will
start with the next value not yet read.
• If there is more than one DATA statement, reading will start
with the one which has the lowest line number. Once all of
the values in that statement have been read, future values
will be read from the next DATA statement.
• An attempt to assign more values than are available in
DATA statements will result in the OUT OF DATA error.
