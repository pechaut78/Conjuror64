"Can FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic be nested?","Yes, FOR-NEXT loops can be nested in C64 Basic, as long as the NEXT statements occur in exactly the opposite order of the corresponding FOR statements. A helpful way to check if the loops are nested correctly is to draw lines connecting the FOR and NEXT statements. If the lines cross, the nesting is incorrect and a 'NEXT WITHOUT FOR' error message will be displayed."
"What is the maximum number of FOR-NEXT loops that can be nested in C64 Basic?","The maximum number of FOR-NEXT loops that can be nested in C64 Basic is nine levels. However, a program usually won't need to nest deeper than that."
"What is the importance of using unique counting variables in FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic?","It is important to use unique counting variables in FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic because a FOR statement cannot use a counting variable that is currently being used by another FOR-NEXT loop."
"What is the effect of incorrectly nested FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic?","If FOR-NEXT loops are incorrectly nested in C64 Basic, a 'NEXT WITHOUT FOR' error message will be displayed."
"How can you visually check if FOR-NEXT loops are correctly nested in C64 Basic?","A helpful way to check if FOR-NEXT loops are correctly nested in C64 Basic is to draw lines connecting the FOR and NEXT statements. If the lines do not cross, the nesting is correct."
"What is the impact of crossing lines when checking the nesting of FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic?","If the lines connecting the FOR and NEXT statements cross while checking the nesting of FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic, it indicates that the nesting is incorrect and a 'NEXT WITHOUT FOR' error message will be displayed."
"Is there a limit to the number of FOR-NEXT loops that can be nested in C64 Basic?","Yes, there is a limit to the number of FOR-NEXT loops that can be nested in C64 Basic. The absolute maximum is nine levels."
"Can the same counting variable be used in multiple FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic?","No, the same counting variable cannot be used in multiple FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic. Each FOR statement must use a unique counting variable."
"What happens if the same counting variable is used in multiple FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic?","If the same counting variable is used in multiple FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic, it will result in an error as a FOR statement cannot use a counting variable that is currently being used by another FOR-NEXT loop."
"What is the recommended maximum depth of nesting FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic?","Although the absolute maximum number of levels of nesting FOR-NEXT loops in C64 Basic is nine, it is recommended to not nest deeper than necessary as a program usually won't have to nest deeper than that."
