C64 Basic:
• Using a large line number increment makes it easier to insert
lines between the existing ones in a program. It is a good
practice to increment by at least 10.
• The RUN command is used to execute a program. Execution
starts at the first line and ends when there are no more lines.
• While a program is being executed, it is said to be running.
• One of the advantages of a program is that lines typed once
can be executed several times.
• Commands are used to help manage a program. They are
used in the immediate mode, but are not usually included
in a program.
