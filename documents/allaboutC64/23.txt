C64 Basic:
 A disk directory is a list of filenames. To get a directory, use
the LOAD command with the filename "$", then use LIST.
This works only for disk files.
• The ten-second delay between the searching and loading of
a tape file can be shortened by pressing the SPACE bar, left
arrow, CTRL, or Commodore key.
• Filenames are optional for tape files. Using LOAD with no
filename will make the computer load the next program
found on the tape. Files saved without a filename can be
retrieved only by using LOAD without a filename.
• To have the computer automatically load and run the next
program found on a tape, press the RUN/STOP key with
either the Commodore or SHIFT key.
