C64 Basic:
The READ and DATA statements offer an alternative
method for assigning values to variables.
• The syntax for the READ statement is the keyword READ
followed by a list of variable names, called a variable list.
Each variable name would be to the left of the equal sign if
a LET statement were used. When more than one variable
name is used in a READ statement, the variable names are
separated by commas.
• The syntax for the DATA statement is the keyword DATA
followed by one or more numbers. If several numbers are
used, they are separated by commas. Two consecutive com
mas are read as the number 0. Only constant values can
be used; variables or expressions cannot be placed in DATA
statements.
