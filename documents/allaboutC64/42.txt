C64 Basic:
A part of a string, consisting of contiguous characters in the
string, is called a substring.
• The substring functions differ from other functions in that
their names are not always three characters long, and they
take multiple arguments of different types.
• The LEFTS and RIGHTS functions need a string for the first
argument, and a number for the second argument. The
substring returned is the leftmost or rightmost characters
in the string. The length of the substring is determined by
the second argument.
• LEFT$ and RIGHTS can be used to split a character string
into two parts, thereby reversing the process of
concatenation.
