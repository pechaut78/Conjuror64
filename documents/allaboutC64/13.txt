C64 Basic:
The relational operators < (less than) and > (greater than)

work just like the equal sign, except that they are used U
in cases of inequality.
• Relational operators can be combined, as in <= and > = .
The combination <> means not equal <—>
• The advantage of these new operators is that they can check
for conditions which cannot be expressed using only the
equal sign. They increase the flexibility of conditional logic.
