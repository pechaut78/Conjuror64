"What is the usual location for placing subroutines in C64 Basic?","Subroutines are usually put after the main program in C64 Basic. This is to avoid accidentally falling into a subroutine when executing the main program."
"What statement is needed to separate the main program from the subroutine in C64 Basic?","An END statement is needed to separate the main program from the subroutine in C64 Basic. This helps prevent the 'RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB' error."
"What happens when execution is transferred to a subroutine in C64 Basic?","When execution is transferred to a subroutine in C64 Basic, it is said that the subroutine has been called. This allows for the reuse of code and modularization of the program."
"How can a subroutine be made more flexible in C64 Basic?","To make a subroutine more flexible in C64 Basic, it can use a variable that is assigned just before the subroutine is called. This allows the subroutine to behave differently based on the input."
"What is the entry point of a subroutine in C64 Basic?","The entry point of a subroutine in C64 Basic is the line to which execution jumps when the subroutine is called. Subroutines can have more than one entry point, allowing for more complex control flow."
"Why is it important to separate the main program from the subroutine in C64 Basic?","Separating the main program from the subroutine in C64 Basic with an END statement helps prevent the 'RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB' error, which occurs when execution accidentally falls into a subroutine."
"What is the effect of not using an END statement to separate the main program from the subroutine in C64 Basic?","If the main program and subroutine are not separated by an END statement in C64 Basic, there is a risk of accidentally falling into the subroutine, which can cause the 'RETURN WITHOUT GOSUB' error."
"How can a subroutine be made to behave differently each time it is called in C64 Basic?","A subroutine can be made to behave differently each time it is called in C64 Basic by using a variable that is assigned just before the subroutine is called. This allows the subroutine to take different actions based on the input."
"What is the purpose of having multiple entry points in a subroutine in C64 Basic?","Having multiple entry points in a subroutine in C64 Basic allows for more complex control flow, as execution can jump to different points within the subroutine depending on the situation."
"What is the effect of not having a clear entry point in a subroutine in C64 Basic?","Not having a clear entry point in a subroutine in C64 Basic can make the code difficult to understand and maintain, as it is unclear where execution will jump when the subroutine is called."
