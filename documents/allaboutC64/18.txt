C64 Basic:
• A program line is placed in memory exactly as it was typed,
except when abbreviations or leading spaces are used. The
question mark is converted to the keyword PRINT before the
line is stored in memory. Only one leading space is put after
the line number, no matter how many were typed when the
line was entered.
• A program line can be changed by typing the same line
number and new statements. The RETURN key must be
pressed to enter the line.
• A program line also can be changed by using the editing
keys to move the cursor to a listing of the line to be
changed so that the INSerT and DELete keys may be used to
modify the line. After the changes have been made, the
RETURN key must be pressed while the cursor is still on
the line.
• A line is deleted by typing only the line number and press
ing RETURN.
• To retrieve a line that has been deleted, the line must be re-
typed unless a listing of the line is still on the screen. In that
case, the cursor can be moved on top of the line, and the
RETURN key pressed. The line will again be part of the
program.
• Even though a line may appear on the screen, it is not nec
essarily a part of the program.
