C64 BAsic:
When the computer executes a LET statement, it follows a
two-step process. First the computer determines a value by
examining the portion of the statement to the right of the
equal sign. Then it assigns that value to the variable sped-
fied to the left of the equal sign.
• The portion to the right of the equal sign can be an expres-
sion containing one or more variables. The variables will be
treated just like numbers. This means that the value of one
variable can be assigned to another variable.
• Statements like LET A=A+1 are legal and in fact are very
useful
