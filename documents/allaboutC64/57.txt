C64 Basic:
• Subscripts must be positive integer numbers. Subscript
numbering starts with 0. A negative subscript produces
an ILLEGAL QUANTITY error. A subscript that is too large
produces the BAD SUBSCRIPT error. The default maximum
subscript is 10.
• The values in an array are usually related to each other in
some way, and are ordered according to the subscripts.
The default values are the number 0 and the null string.
• The advantage of using an array is that it makes it easier to
manage a lot of values. Because subscripts can be variables,
arrays are ideal for use in loops.
