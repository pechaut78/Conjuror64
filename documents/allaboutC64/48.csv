"What are the two kinds of loops in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, there are two kinds of loops: the first kind repeats indefinitely until a condition is met, and the computer does not know how many times the loop will be executed. The second type of loop repeats a set number of times, and the computer knows when it enters the loop how many times the loop will be executed."
"What is a feature of the kind of loop which repeats a set number of times in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, a feature of the kind of loop which repeats a set number of times is that it requires assignment statements, conditional logic, and a way to make execution jump to the top of a loop."
"What statements are used to simplify the handling of loops which repeat a specified number of times in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, the FOR and NEXT statements are used to simplify the handling of loops which repeat a specified number of times. These two statements do all the work normally done by two LET statements and an IF-GOTO statement."
"What is the syntax of the FOR statement in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, the syntax of the FOR statement starts with the keyword FOR, followed by the name of the counting variable, an equal sign, a value which is the starting value for the loop, the keyword TO, another value which is the ending value for the loop, and optionally, the keyword STEP and one more value."
"What is the name of the counting variable in the FOR statement in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, the name of the counting variable in the FOR statement must be a numeric variable."
"What kind of variable cannot be used as the counting variable in the FOR statement in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, string variables cannot be used as the counting variable in the FOR statement."
"What value follows the equal sign in the FOR statement in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, the value which follows the equal sign in the FOR statement is the starting value for the loop."
"What keyword follows the ending value for the loop in the FOR statement in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, the keyword TO follows the ending value for the loop in the FOR statement."
"What is optional in the FOR statement in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, the keyword STEP and one more value are optional in the FOR statement."
"What do the FOR and NEXT statements do in C64 Basic?","In C64 Basic, the FOR and NEXT statements simplify the handling of loops which repeat a specified number of times by doing the work normally done by two LET statements and an IF-GOTO statement."
