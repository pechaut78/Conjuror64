s a shortcut, the keyword LET of the variable assignment
statement does not have to be typed, it is optional.
• LET is the only optional keyword. All other statements
require a keyword. If no keyword is provided, the computer
assumes that the statement is a LET statement.
• A LET statement which does not include the keyword LET is
called an implied LET statement.
- The rest of the syntax of the LET statement after the
keyword is still required.
• The remaining examples in this book will not use the
keyword LET.
