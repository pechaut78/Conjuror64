"What is the purpose of the GOTO statement in C64 Basic?","The GOTO statement in C64 Basic is used to change the order of execution of program lines. It allows the program to jump to a different line, either forward or backward, instead of executing the next line in sequence."
"How does GOTO affect the execution of a C64 Basic program?","GOTO causes the execution of a C64 Basic program to jump to a different line, rather than executing the next line in sequence. This allows for the execution of program lines to be rearranged as needed."
"Can GOTO be used to move execution forward or backward in a C64 Basic program?","Yes, GOTO can be used to move execution forward or backward in a C64 Basic program. It allows the program to jump to a different line, regardless of its position in the sequence."
"What is a loop in C64 Basic?","A loop in C64 Basic is a series of lines that are repeated continuously. It is formed when GOTO is used to skip backward so that the lines can be executed again."
"What happens if a loop in C64 Basic is executed continuously without stopping?","If a loop in C64 Basic is executed continuously without stopping, it is called an infinite loop. This can cause the program to become stuck and unable to continue executing."
"How can a loop be created in C64 Basic?","A loop can be created in C64 Basic by using the GOTO statement to skip backward so that a series of lines are repeated. For example, a loop could be created by using GOTO to jump back to the beginning of the loop after the last line in the loop has been executed."
"What is the role of the GOTO statement in creating a loop in C64 Basic?","The GOTO statement plays a crucial role in creating a loop in C64 Basic. It is used to skip backward so that a series of lines can be repeated, forming a loop. Without the GOTO statement, it would not be possible to create a loop in C64 Basic."
"What is an example of a simple loop in C64 Basic?","Here is an example of a simple loop in C64 Basic: 10 PRINT 'HELLO' 20 GOTO 10. In this example, the line that prints 'HELLO' is repeated continuously because of the GOTO statement, which causes execution to jump back to the beginning of the loop."
"What is an infinite loop in C64 Basic?","An infinite loop in C64 Basic is a loop that is executed continuously without stopping. It is created when the GOTO statement is used to skip backward so that a series of lines are repeated without end."
"How can an infinite loop be avoided in C64 Basic?","An infinite loop can be avoided in C64 Basic by including a condition in the loop that will cause it to stop executing. For example, a counter could be used to keep track of the number of times the loop has been executed, and the loop could be made to stop when the counter reaches a certain value."
