C64 Basic:
The ON statement is used to get around the problem that
line numbers after GOTO or GOSUB cannot be expressions
or variables.
• The syntax for the ON statement consists of the keyword
ON, a numeric value, the keyword GOTO or the keyword
GOSUB, and a list of line numbers.
When executed, the ON statement takes the integer portion
of the numeric value, counts that far into the line number
list, and then performs a GOTO or GOSUB to that line.
• If the value exceeds the number of line numbers in the list,
or if the value is 0, the statement will be ignored. Execution
will continue with the next statement, which may be on the
same line.
• A negative value produces the ILLEGAL QUANTITY error.
