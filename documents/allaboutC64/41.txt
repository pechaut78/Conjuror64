C64 Basic:

• The VAL and STR$ functions are used to convert a value
from one type to the other, to avoid the TYPE MISMATCH
error.
• The VAL function takes a string, interprets the characters
which are related to numbers, and returns a value.
• VAL ignores any leading spaces.
• The interpretation uses all characters in the string, starting at
the beginning, until the end of the string is reached, or a
character is found which is not related to numbers.
• The only characters which are related to numbers are the ten
digits, the plus and minus signs, and the period.
• The null string and strings which start with a nonnumeric
character cause VAL to.return a value of 0.
• The STR$ function takes a number and produces its charac
ter representation. This representation includes all the
characters that would be used if the number were printed.
If the number is positive, the string will start with a space.
