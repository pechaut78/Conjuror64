C64 Basic:
• If an error occurs while a program is running, execution
stops immediately. The error message is printed, along with
an indication of which line contains the error.
• Holding down the CTRL key while a program is listing will
cause the lines to scroll more slowly.
• The LIST command can be used to list a specific line, by
typing the line number after the keyword.
• A line number range can be specified after LIST. A dash
must be placed between the starting and ending line
numbers.
• Using LIST with a line number followed by a dash causes
the listing to start at the line number and continue to the
end of the program. Using LIST with a dash followed by a
line number causes the listing to start at the first line in the
program and continue to the specified line number.
• The RUN command usually starts executing a program at
the first line. To start execution at a line other than the first,
that line number must be specified after the keyword RUN.
A line number range may not be used with this command.
