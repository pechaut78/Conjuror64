C64 Basic:
• The only restrictions in dimensioning an array are that the
computer must have enough unused memory to hold the
array, and the array must not be dimensioned already.
• Trying to DIM an array when there is insufficient memory
causes the OUT OF MEMORY error.
• Attempting to DIM an array that is already dimensioned
causes the REDIM'D ARRAY error.
