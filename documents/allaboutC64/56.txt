C64 Basic:
• An array is a group of numbers or character strings which
have a common name but can be individually accessed.
• The same restrictions that apply to a variable name also
apply to array names.
• Array names are separate from variable names.
• To assign one array to another, each value in the array must
be copied separately.
• To specify one particular value in an array, a number in
parentheses is placed after the array name. This number
is called a subscript.
