C64 Basic:
The syntax of the INPUT statement is the keyword INPUT,
an optional character string terminated with a semicolon,
and a variable list.
• If the character string is used, it must be in quotes, and it
must be followed by a semicolon, or a SYNTAX ERROR will
occur.
• When INPUT is executed, the character string is printed first,
if one was provided.
• The INPUT statement then prints a question mark, and
waits for the user to type one or more numbers and press
RETURN. During this time the program is executing just
the INPUT statement.
• The numbers entered are assigned to the variables in the
variable list.
• If not enough numbers are entered, a second prompt,
consisting of two question marks, is printed, and the com-
puter waits for more numbers to be entered.
• If too many numbers are entered, a warning message that
says EXTRA IGNORED is printed, and only the first few
values are assigned to variables. The extra numbers are not
used.
