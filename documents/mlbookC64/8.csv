question,answer
"What value is loaded into the X-register with the instruction LDX #$7F?","The X-register is loaded with the hexadecimal value $7F, which is equivalent to the decimal value 127, with the instruction LDX #$7F."
"What value is loaded into the Y-register with the instruction LDY #0?","The Y-register is loaded with the hexadecimal value 0, which is equivalent to the decimal value 0, with the instruction LDY #0."
"What addressing mode is used in the instructions LDX #$7F and LDY #0?","The immediate addressing mode is used in the instructions LDX #$7F and LDY #0. This mode specifies that the value to be loaded is part of the program and is placed in the next memory location after the instruction."
"How does the 6510 microprocessor determine the instruction and value to be loaded with the immediate addressing mode?","The 6510 microprocessor determines the instruction by looking at the value of the instruction and comparing it to a table of instructions. The value to be loaded is placed in the next memory location after the instruction."
"What happens to the program counter after the 6510 microprocessor reads the instruction and value in the immediate addressing mode?","After the 6510 microprocessor reads the instruction and value in the immediate addressing mode, it automatically increments the program counter by two, so that it points to the next instruction to be executed by the microprocessor."
"What is the size of the instruction and value in the immediate addressing mode in terms of memory locations?","The instruction and value in the immediate addressing mode are both one byte in size, so they occupy two memory locations in total."
"What is the effect of the LDA instruction on the accumulator in the 6510 microprocessor?","The LDA instruction places the contents of the memory location specified in the instruction into the accumulator of the 6510 microprocessor."
"What is the purpose of the diagram that follows the text?","The purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the operation of the 6510 microprocessor and the effect of the instructions on the accumulator and the program counter."
"What is the difference between the LDA instruction and the LDX and LDY instructions in the 6510 microprocessor?","The LDA instruction loads the accumulator with a value from memory, while the LDX and LDY instructions load the X and Y registers, respectively, with a value from memory. The LDA instruction is used to perform arithmetic and logical operations on data, while the LDX and LDY instructions are used to manipulate memory addresses and pointers."
"What is the role of the program counter in the 6510 microprocessor?","The program counter is a register in the 6510 microprocessor that stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed. It is automatically incremented by the microprocessor after each instruction is executed, so that it points to the next instruction in the program."
