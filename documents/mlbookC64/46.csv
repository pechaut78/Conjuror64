"What determines whether the processor can accept an interrupt or not in 6502 assembly?","The I flag determines whether the processor is ready to accept an interrupt or not. If the I flag is set with SEI (set interrupt disable), no interrupts will be accepted, while if it is cleared with CLI (clear interrupt disable), the processor can accept interrupts."
"How can you disable interrupts in 6502 assembly?","You can disable interrupts in 6502 assembly by using the SEI (set interrupt disable) instruction, which sets the I flag and prevents the processor from accepting interrupts."
"How can you enable interrupts in 6502 assembly?","You can enable interrupts in 6502 assembly by using the CLI (clear interrupt disable) instruction, which clears the I flag and allows the processor to accept interrupts."
"What does the SEI instruction do in 6502 assembly?","The SEI (set interrupt disable) instruction sets the I flag in 6502 assembly, which prevents the processor from accepting interrupts."
"What does the CLI instruction do in 6502 assembly?","The CLI (clear interrupt disable) instruction clears the I flag in 6502 assembly, which allows the processor to accept interrupts."
"What is the purpose of the I flag in 6502 assembly?","The I flag in 6502 assembly determines whether the processor is ready to accept an interrupt or not. If the I flag is set, no interrupts will be accepted, while if it is cleared, the processor can accept interrupts."
"How can you check the current state of the I flag in 6502 assembly?","The current state of the I flag can be checked in 6502 assembly by using the PHP (push processor status) instruction, which pushes the processor status, including the I flag, onto the stack."
"What is the effect of the I flag on interrupt handling in 6502 assembly?","The I flag determines whether the processor can accept interrupts or not in 6502 assembly. If the I flag is set, no interrupts will be accepted, while if it is cleared, the processor can accept interrupts."
"What is the difference between the SEI and CLI instructions in 6502 assembly?","The SEI (set interrupt disable) instruction sets the I flag in 6502 assembly, which prevents the processor from accepting interrupts, while the CLI (clear interrupt disable) instruction clears the I flag, which allows the processor to accept interrupts."
"What is the role of the I flag in the interrupt handling process in 6502 assembly?","The I flag in 6502 assembly determines whether the processor is ready to accept an interrupt or not. If the I flag is set, no interrupts will be accepted, while if it is cleared, the processor can accept interrupts. This flag is used to control the interrupt handling process in 6502 assembly."
