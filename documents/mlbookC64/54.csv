"What is the opposite of the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language?","The opposite of the ROL (rotate left) instruction in C64 assembly language is the ROR (rotate right) instruction. This instruction rotates the contents of a register cyclically one position to the right."
"How does the ROR instruction affect the carry flag in C64 assembly language?","The ROR instruction in C64 assembly language places the contents of the carry flag into the now-free position 7 of the register while the pushed-out contents of bit 0 are placed into the carry flag."
"What does the ROR instruction do to the contents of a register in C64 assembly language?","The ROR instruction in C64 assembly language rotates the contents of a register cyclically one position to the right, shifting the bits to the right and placing the contents of the carry flag into the now-free position 7."
"What is the effect of the ROR instruction on the carry flag and the contents of a register in C64 assembly language?","The ROR instruction in C64 assembly language places the contents of the carry flag into the now-free position 7 of the register and the pushed-out contents of bit 0 into the carry flag, while rotating the contents of the register cyclically one position to the right."
"What is the result of rotating the contents of a register to the right in C64 assembly language?","The result of rotating the contents of a register to the right using the ROR instruction in C64 assembly language is that the bits are shifted to the right and the contents of the carry flag are placed into the now-free position 7."
"What is the difference between the ROL and ROR instructions in C64 assembly language?","The ROL (rotate left) instruction in C64 assembly language rotates the contents of a register cyclically one position to the left, while the ROR (rotate right) instruction rotates the contents of a register cyclically one position to the right. Additionally, the ROR instruction affects the carry flag differently than the ROL instruction."
"How does the ROR instruction affect the bits of a register in C64 assembly language?","The ROR instruction in C64 assembly language affects the bits of a register by rotating them cyclically one position to the right, shifting the bits to the right and placing the contents of the carry flag into the now-free position 7."
"What is the result of the ROR instruction on the carry flag and the bits of a register in C64 assembly language?","The result of the ROR instruction on the carry flag and the bits of a register in C64 assembly language is that the contents of the carry flag are placed into the now-free position 7 of the register and the pushed-out contents of bit 0 are placed into the carry flag, while the bits of the register are rotated cyclically one position to the right."
"What is the purpose of the ROR instruction in C64 assembly language?","The purpose of the ROR instruction in C64 assembly language is to rotate the contents of a register cyclically one position to the right, shifting the bits to the right and placing the contents of the carry flag into the now-free position 7."
