"What is indirect indexed addressing in C64 assembly language?","Indirect indexed addressing is an addressing mode in C64 assembly language that uses two consecutive memory locations in zero-page to form a pointer to the actual address. The first memory cell contains the low-byte, and the next contains the high-byte of the actual address. This addressing mode allows for very flexible programming, but it can be harder to understand."
"How does indirect indexed addressing use zero-page?","In indirect indexed addressing, zero-page plays an important role. Two consecutive memory locations in zero-page form a pointer to the actual address. This means that the first memory cell contains the low-byte and the next contains the high-byte of the actual address."
"What is the format of the pointer in indirect indexed addressing?","In indirect indexed addressing, the pointer to the actual address is formed by using two consecutive memory locations in zero-page. The first memory cell contains the low-byte and the next contains the high-byte of the actual address."
"What is the purpose of the low-byte and high-byte in indirect indexed addressing?","In indirect indexed addressing, the low-byte and high-byte are used to form the pointer to the actual address. The first memory cell contains the low-byte and the next contains the high-byte of the actual address."
"How does indirect indexed addressing differ from other addressing modes?","Indirect indexed addressing differs from other addressing modes in that it uses two consecutive memory locations in zero-page to form a pointer to the actual address. This allows for more flexible programming, but it can be harder to understand compared to other addressing modes."
"What is the advantage of using indirect indexed addressing?","The advantage of using indirect indexed addressing is that it allows for very flexible programming. This addressing mode uses two consecutive memory locations in zero-page to form a pointer to the actual address, which allows for a wide range of possibilities when writing C64 assembly code."
"What is the disadvantage of using indirect indexed addressing?","The disadvantage of using indirect indexed addressing is that it can be harder to understand compared to other addressing modes. This is because it uses two consecutive memory locations in zero-page to form a pointer to the actual address, which can make the code more complex."
"Can you provide an example of indirect indexed addressing in C64 assembly language?","Here is an example of indirect indexed addressing in C64 assembly language:

LDA ($FB),Y

In this example, the value of the address pointed to by the zero-page addresses $FB and $FC is loaded into the accumulator. The value of the Y register is added to the address, so the effective address is ($FB) + Y."
"What is the role of the Y register in the example of indirect indexed addressing?","In the example of indirect indexed addressing provided, the Y register is added to the address pointed to by the zero-page addresses $FB and $FC. This is done to calculate the effective address, which is then used to load a value into the accumulator."
