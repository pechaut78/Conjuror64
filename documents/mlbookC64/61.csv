"What is the purpose of the interrupt line (IRQ) in the 6510 processor?","The interrupt line (IRQ) in the 6510 processor is used to activate an interrupt from the outside world. When the IRQ is activated, the processor interrupts the current program and places the contents of the program counter and the status register on the stack. Execution then branches to the address contained at $FFFE and $FFFF, which are used as the new program counter."
"What is the role of the BRK instruction in the 6510 processor?","The BRK instruction in the 6510 processor serves to interrupt a program from within. When the BRK instruction is executed, the program counter and the status register are saved on the stack."
"How can the program return to the main program from an interrupt routine in the 6510 processor?","The RTI (return from interrupt) instruction is used to return to the main program from an interrupt routine in the 6510 processor. The RTI instruction gets the program counter and the contents of the status register back from the stack so that the program can continue without changing the flags."
"What happens to the program counter and status register when an interrupt occurs in the 6510 processor?","When an interrupt occurs in the 6510 processor, the contents of the program counter and the status register are placed on the stack."
"What is the similarity between a subroutine call and an interrupt procedure in the 6510 processor?","The interrupt procedure in the 6510 processor is similar to a subroutine call in that the program counter and the status register are saved on the stack and execution branches to a new address."
"What is the purpose of the $FFFE and $FFFF addresses in the 6510 processor?","The $FFFE and $FFFF addresses in the 6510 processor contain the new program counter that execution branches to when an interrupt occurs."
"What is the role of the stack in handling interrupts in the 6510 processor?","The stack is used to save the contents of the program counter and the status register when an interrupt occurs in the 6510 processor. The RTI instruction gets the program counter and the contents of the status register back from the stack so that the program can continue."
"What is the difference between an interrupt from the outside and an interrupt from within the program in the 6510 processor?","An interrupt from the outside is initiated by activating the IRQ line, while an interrupt from within the program is initiated by the BRK instruction."
"What is the purpose of the RTI instruction in the 6510 processor?","The RTI instruction in the 6510 processor is used to return to the main program from an interrupt routine by getting the program counter and the contents of the status register back from the stack."
"What happens to the flags when the RTI instruction is executed in the 6510 processor?","The flags are not changed when the RTI instruction is executed in the 6510 processor."
