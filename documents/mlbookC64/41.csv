"What operation does the DEX instruction perform on the X register in 6502 assembly?","The DEX instruction in 6502 assembly language decrements the value in the X register by 1. For example, if the value in the X register is $05, after executing the DEX instruction, the value will be $04."
"What happens to the carry flag when the X register is decremented from $00 to $FF using the DEX instruction?","The carry flag is not set when the X register is decremented from $00 to $FF using the DEX instruction. This is because the decrement operation wraps around from $00 to $FF, and no borrow is required."
"How are the N and Z flags affected by the DEX instruction in 6502 assembly?","The N (negative) flag is set if the result of the decrement operation is negative. In other words, if the value in the X register is $80 or less, the N flag will be set after executing the DEX instruction. The Z (zero) flag is set if the result of the decrement operation is zero. In other words, if the value in the X register is $00, the Z flag will be set after executing the DEX instruction."
"How can the DEX instruction be written in pseduo-BASIC?","In pseduo-BASIC, the DEX instruction can be written as X=X-1. This will decrement the value in the X variable by 1."
"What is the effect of the DEX instruction on the X register in a 6502 assembly program?","The DEX instruction decrements the value in the X register by 1. This can be useful for looping through arrays or other data structures, or for implementing certain algorithms that require a counter to be decremented."
"What is the difference between the DEX and DEC instructions in 6502 assembly?","The DEX instruction decrements the value in the X register, while the DEC instruction decrements the value in a memory location specified by the programmer. Both instructions decrement the value by 1, but the DEC instruction allows the programmer to specify the memory location to be decremented, while the DEX instruction only affects the X register."
"Can the DEX instruction be used to decrement the value in a memory location in 6502 assembly?","No, the DEX instruction can only be used to decrement the value in the X register. To decrement the value in a memory location, the programmer must use the DEC instruction and specify the memory location to be decremented."
"What is the machine code for the DEX instruction in 6502 assembly?","The machine code for the DEX instruction in 6502 assembly is $CA. This can be used in machine code programs or in assembly programs that include inline machine code."
"What is the mnemonic for the instruction that decrements the value in the X register in 6502 assembly?","The mnemonic for the instruction that decrements the value in the X register in 6502 assembly is DEX. This mnemonic is used in assembly programs to represent the machine code instruction that decrements the X register."
"What is the purpose of the DEX instruction in 6502 assembly?","The DEX instruction in 6502 assembly is used to decrement the value in the X register by 1. This can be useful for looping through arrays or other data structures, or for implementing certain algorithms that require a counter to be decremented."
