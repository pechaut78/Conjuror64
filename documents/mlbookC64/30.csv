"What is the function of the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The CPY instruction in C64 assembly language is used to compare the accumulator with the contents of memory, and then skip the next instruction if they are equal. It is similar to the CPX instruction, but uses the Y-register instead of the X-register. The CPY instruction has three addressing modes: immediate, absolute, and zero page."
"What are the three addressing modes of the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The three addressing modes of the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language are immediate, absolute, and zero page. The immediate mode allows the programmer to specify a constant value to be used as the second operand. The absolute mode allows the programmer to specify a memory address as the second operand. The zero page mode allows the programmer to specify a memory address in the first 256 bytes of memory as the second operand."
"How does the CPY instruction differ from the CPX instruction in C64 assembly language?","The CPY instruction in C64 assembly language is similar to the CPX instruction, but uses the Y-register instead of the X-register. Both instructions are used to compare the accumulator with the contents of memory, and then skip the next instruction if they are equal. The only difference is the register used for the comparison."
"What register is used by the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The CPY instruction in C64 assembly language uses the Y-register. It is similar to the CPX instruction, but uses the Y-register instead of the X-register. The CPY instruction is used to compare the accumulator with the contents of memory, and then skip the next instruction if they are equal."
"What is the use of the Y-register in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The Y-register is used in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language to compare the accumulator with the contents of memory, and then skip the next instruction if they are equal. It is used in place of the X-register, which is used in the CPX instruction. The Y-register is one of the index registers in the 6510 microprocessor, which is used in the C64 computer."
"What is the purpose of the skip function in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The skip function in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language is used to skip the next instruction if the accumulator and the contents of memory are equal. This function is useful when the programmer wants to execute a certain instruction only if the accumulator and the contents of memory are not equal. The skip function is activated by setting the zero flag in the processor status register."
"What is the effect of the immediate addressing mode in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The immediate addressing mode in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language allows the programmer to specify a constant value to be used as the second operand. This means that the accumulator is compared with the constant value, and the next instruction is skipped if they are equal. The immediate addressing mode is useful when the programmer wants to compare the accumulator with a specific value, and execute a certain instruction based on the result."
"What is the effect of the absolute addressing mode in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The absolute addressing mode in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language allows the programmer to specify a memory address as the second operand. This means that the accumulator is compared with the contents of the memory address, and the next instruction is skipped if they are equal. The absolute addressing mode is useful when the programmer wants to compare the accumulator with the contents of a specific memory location, and execute a certain instruction based on the result."
"What is the effect of the zero page addressing mode in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language?","The zero page addressing mode in the CPY instruction in C64 assembly language allows the programmer to specify a memory address in the first 256 bytes of memory as the second operand. This means that the accumulator is compared with the contents of the memory address, and the next instruction is skipped if they are equal. The zero page addressing mode is useful when the programmer wants to compare the accumulator with the contents of a memory location in the zero page, and execute a certain instruction based on the result."
"How does the CPY instruction affect the program flow in C64 assembly language?","The CPY instruction in C64 assembly language affects the program flow by skipping the next instruction if the accumulator and the contents of memory are equal. This allows the programmer to execute a certain instruction only if the accumulator and the contents of memory are not equal. The CPY instruction is useful when the programmer wants to test the equality of the accumulator and a memory location, and branch to a different part of the program based on the result."
