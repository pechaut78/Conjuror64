When executing absolute addressing mode instruc
tions, the processor gets the low-byte and then the
high-byte of the address. The data found at that
address is placed into the accumulator, the program
counter is incremented by three and the next
instruction is fetched. These instructions require
three bytes, in contrast to the immediate
addressing mode which requires only two.
