Zero-page addressing
Another addressing mode is called the zero-page
addressing mode. This addressing mode can be used
if the address of the data is in memory locations
between 0 and $FF (255). This results in a two-byte
instruction in contrast to the three-byte instruc
tion of the absolute addressing mode. Zero-page
addressing instructions occupy less memory and
execute faster. A disadvantage, of course, is that
the data must be located in addresses from 0 to
255.
Where did the term zero-page originate? You can
think of the 64K of memory as being divided into
256 pages, each containing 256 bytes. Thus memory
locations 0 thru 255 form page zero.
A zero-page load instruction looks like this:
