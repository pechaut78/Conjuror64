The BIT instruction
A special feature of the 65XX microprocessors is the BIT
instruction. This instruction does not change the
contents of any registers. It affects only the flags. The
contents of the accumulator are ANDed with the contents
of the addressed memory location. If the final result is
zero, the Z flag is set, otherwise it is cleared.
Additionally, the value of the sixth bit of the addressed
location is placed into the V flag and the seventh bit is
put in the N flag. With this one can check these two bits
of a memory location without disturbing the contents of
any of the registers. Let us look at an example:
LDA #$10
BIT $1234
The accumulator contains $10; address $1234 contains $43.
