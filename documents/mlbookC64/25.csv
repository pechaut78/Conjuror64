"What is the purpose of the Exclusive OR (EOR) instruction in C64 assembly language?","The Exclusive OR (EOR) instruction in C64 assembly language is used to compare the accumulator and an operand bit by bit. The result is set to one if either one or the other bit is one, but not both. It is useful for performing bit-level operations and comparisons."
"What is the result of 0 EOR 0 in C64 assembly language?","The result of 0 EOR 0 in C64 assembly language is 0. This is because neither bit is one."
"What is the result of 0 EOR 1 in C64 assembly language?","The result of 0 EOR 1 in C64 assembly language is 1. This is because one of the bits is one."
"What is the result of 1 EOR 0 in C64 assembly language?","The result of 1 EOR 0 in C64 assembly language is 1. This is because one of the bits is one."
"What is the result of 1 EOR 1 in C64 assembly language?","The result of 1 EOR 1 in C64 assembly language is 0. This is because neither bit is one."
"What is the truth table for the EOR instruction in C64 assembly language?","The truth table for the EOR instruction in C64 assembly language is as follows: 0 EOR 0=0, 0 EOR 1=1, 1 EOR 0=1, 1 EOR 1=0. It shows the result of the operation for all possible combinations of the operands."
"How does the EOR instruction compare the accumulator and the operand in C64 assembly language?","The EOR instruction compares the accumulator and the operand bit by bit in C64 assembly language. It sets the result to one if either one or the other bit is one, but not both."
"What is the purpose of using the EOR instruction for bit-level operations in C64 assembly language?","The EOR instruction is used for bit-level operations in C64 assembly language because it allows for the comparison of individual bits in the accumulator and the operand. This can be useful for a variety of tasks, such as toggling specific bits or checking the parity of data."
"What is the difference between the EOR instruction and the OR instruction in C64 assembly language?","The EOR instruction and the OR instruction in C64 assembly language both perform bit-level operations, but they have different results. The EOR instruction sets the result to one if either one or the other bit is one, but not both. The OR instruction, on the other hand, sets the result to one if either one or the other bit is one, regardless of whether both bits are one."
"What is the purpose of using the EOR instruction for bit-level comparisons in C64 assembly language?","The EOR instruction is used for bit-level comparisons in C64 assembly language because it allows for the comparison of individual bits in the accumulator and the operand. This can be useful for tasks such as checking the parity of data or determining the status of specific bits."
