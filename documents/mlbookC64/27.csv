"What operation do the compare instructions perform to determine the relationship of two numbers?","The compare instructions logically subtract the contents of the addressed memory location from the contents of a register, but they do not change the register contents. This logical subtraction sets the flags as if an actual subtraction occurred, affecting the N, Z, and £ flags based on the result of the subtraction."
"Which flags are affected by the compare instructions?","The N, Z, and £ flags are affected by the compare instructions. The N flag is set if the result of the subtraction is negative, the Z flag is set if the result is zero, and the £ flag is set if the result is less than zero."
"Do the compare instructions change the contents of the register or memory?","No, the compare instructions do not change the contents of the register or memory. They only affect the flags based on the result of the subtraction."
"What is the purpose of the compare instructions in C64 assembly language?","The purpose of the compare instructions is to determine the relationship of two numbers by examining the flags. They do this by logically subtracting the contents of the addressed memory location from the contents of a register, but they do not change the register contents. Instead, they set the flags based on the result of the subtraction."
"What are the three work registers of the microprocessor that have compare commands associated with them?","The three work registers of the microprocessor that have compare commands associated with them are the A, X, and Y registers."
"What is the difference between the compare instructions and a regular subtraction operation?","The difference between the compare instructions and a regular subtraction operation is that the compare instructions do not change the contents of the register or memory. They only affect the flags based on the result of the subtraction."
"How do the compare instructions work in C64 assembly language?","The compare instructions in C64 assembly language work by logically subtracting the contents of the addressed memory location from the contents of a register. They set the flags based on the result of the subtraction, but they do not change the register contents."
"What information can be obtained by examining the flags after a compare instruction is executed?","By examining the flags after a compare instruction is executed, you can determine the relationship of the two numbers. For example, if the N flag is set, the result of the subtraction is negative. If the Z flag is set, the result is zero. And if the £ flag is set, the result is less than zero."
"What is an example of a compare instruction in C64 assembly language?","An example of a compare instruction in C64 assembly language is CMP $1000, X. This instruction compares the contents of the X register with the contents of the memory location $1000. It sets the flags based on the result of the subtraction, but it does not change the contents of the X register or the memory location $1000."
