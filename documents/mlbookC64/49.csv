"What does ASL stand for in C64 assembly language?","ASL stands for 'arithmetic shift left' in C64 assembly language. It is a shift operation that moves the bits of the addressed byte to the left by one bit-position."
"What does ASL do to the addressed byte in C64 assembly language?","ASL shifts the bits of the addressed byte to the left by one bit-position. This has the effect of multiplying the value of the byte by 2."
"What is placed in the right-most bit (bit 0) after an ASL operation in C64 assembly language?","A zero is placed in the right-most bit (bit 0) after an ASL operation in C64 assembly language."
"What is the carry flag set equal to after an ASL operation in C64 assembly language?","The carry flag is set equal to the left-most bit (bit 7) after an ASL operation in C64 assembly language."
"What is an example of ASL instruction in C64 assembly language?","An example of an ASL instruction in C64 assembly language is 'ASL $D020'. This shifts the bits of the byte stored at memory address $D020 to the left by one bit-position."
"What is the impact of ASL on the negative flag in C64 assembly language?","ASL does not directly impact the negative flag in C64 assembly language. The negative flag is set based on the most significant bit (bit 7) of the result, which remains unchanged after an ASL operation."
"What is the impact of ASL on the overflow flag in C64 assembly language?","ASL does not directly impact the overflow flag in C64 assembly language. The overflow flag is set based on the carry flag, which is set equal to the left-most bit (bit 7) after an ASL operation."
"What is the impact of ASL on the zero flag in C64 assembly language?","ASL can impact the zero flag in C64 assembly language. If the result of the ASL operation is zero, the zero flag is set. Otherwise, the zero flag is cleared."
"What is the difference between ASL and LSR in C64 assembly language?","The main difference between ASL and LSR in C64 assembly language is the direction of the shift. ASL shifts bits to the left, while LSR shifts bits to the right. Additionally, ASL multiplies the value of the byte by 2, while LSR divides the value of the byte by 2."
"What are the use cases of ASL in C64 assembly language?","ASL is used in C64 assembly language to multiply a value by 2, shift bits to the left, and set the carry flag equal to the left-most bit. It can be used in arithmetic operations, bit manipulation, and flag setting."
