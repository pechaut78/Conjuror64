The Jump instructions
In contrast to the conditional branch commands above, the
unconditional jump instructions branches to an absolute
address. These instructions are not dependent on any
condition and is always executed. The destination address
is specified in reverse sequence (low-byte followed by
high-byte) as are the other absolute addresses.
JMP $C420 direct jump to location $C420
In addition to the absolute form of the jump instruction,
there is also an indirect addressing form, a peculiarity
of the jump instructions. With this instruction, the
specified address is not jumped to. Instead, this address
tells where to get the actual destination address. For
this, two consecutive bytes are again used as a pointer,
in the format low byte, high byte.
JMP ($0302) indirect jump to destination pointed
to by address $0302
The actual address is now taken from memory locations
$0302 and $0303. If, for example, $40 and $C8 are in
these locations, a branch to location $C840 will be made.
This method of addressing works only with the JMP
instruction.

The operating system of the Commodore 64 makes use of
this method of addressing. There are several addresses
(called vectors) located from $300 to $33C, that contain
addresses for indirect JMPs. The operating system uses
these vectors for performing frequently used routines.
