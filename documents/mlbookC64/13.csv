"What is indexed addressing mode in the context of the Commodore 64?","Indexed addressing mode is a way of addressing memory locations in the Commodore 64's 6510 processor. In this mode, the X or Y registers are added to an absolute address to obtain the final address. This mode is useful for programming loops and working with tables."
"How does absolute addressing indexed by X work in the Commodore 64?","In absolute addressing indexed by X, the contents of the X register are added to an absolute address, and the accumulator is loaded with the contents of the resulting address. For example, if the X register contains $35 and the absolute address is $25B8, the final address would be $25ED, and the accumulator would be loaded with the contents of $25ED."
"What is the pseudo-BASIC equivalent of absolute addressing indexed by X?","The pseudo-BASIC equivalent of absolute addressing indexed by X is A = PEEK(address + X), where address is the absolute address."
"Can the Y register be used in place of the X register for indexed addressing?","Yes, the Y register can be used in place of the X register for indexed addressing. In this case, the contents of the Y register are added to the absolute address to obtain the final address."
"What is the advantage of using both the X and Y registers for indexed addressing?","Using both the X and Y registers for indexed addressing provides two independent index variables, which can be used for programming nested loops."
"What is an example of absolute addressing indexed by X in machine language?","An example of absolute addressing indexed by X in machine language is LDA $25B8,X. This instruction loads the accumulator with the contents of the memory location obtained by adding the contents of the X register to the absolute address $25B8."
"What is the difference between absolute addressing and absolute addressing indexed by X?","The difference between absolute addressing and absolute addressing indexed by X is that in absolute addressing, the accumulator is loaded with the contents of the absolute address, while in absolute addressing indexed by X, the accumulator is loaded with the contents of the address obtained by adding the contents of the X register to the absolute address."
"How is indexed addressing useful for programming loops in the Commodore 64?","Indexed addressing is useful for programming loops in the Commodore 64 because it allows the programmer to easily increment or decrement the index register to access different elements of a loop or table."
"What are some examples of the use of indexed addressing in the Commodore 64?","Some examples of the use of indexed addressing in the Commodore 64 include accessing elements of an array, implementing a counter in a loop, and accessing pixels in a graphics routine."
"How does indexed addressing differ from direct addressing in the Commodore 64?","Indexed addressing and direct addressing are both ways of addressing memory locations in the Commodore 64. In indexed addressing, the X or Y register is added to an absolute address to obtain the final address, while in direct addressing, the accumulator is loaded with the contents of a memory location specified by a direct address."
