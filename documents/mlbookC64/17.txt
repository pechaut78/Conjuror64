 Indexed Indirect Addressing
Another addressing mode is the indexed indirect
address mode, in contrast to the above indirect
indexed addressing mode. It works with the X-
register instead of the Y-register. Here also the
address is formed from two consecutive zero-page
locations. When calculating the address, the index
is first added to the pointer and then the contents
are used as a pointer to the actual address.
