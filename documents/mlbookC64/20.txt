The Arithmetic Instructions
As with most 8-bit microprocessors, the 6510 can perform
only two arithmetic operations - addition and
subtraction. Multiplication and division must be
implemented by the user. Each calculation requires two
operands which are combined to produce a result. For the
6510, the first operand is contained in the accumulator
and the second operand is obtained from memory. The
various addressing modes are used for this. The result of
the arithmetic operation is always left in the
accumulator. The comparisons with the corresponding
pseudo-BASIC commands makes this clearer.
First consider addition. The contents of the addressed
memory location are added to the accumulator and the
result is again placed back in the accumulator.
ADC #$3A A = A + $3A
If you add two 8-bit values (0 to 255), the result may
not be able to be represented by an 8-bit number. An
overflow may occur.
