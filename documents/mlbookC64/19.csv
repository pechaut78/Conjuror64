"What is the purpose of transfer instructions in the 6510 microprocessor?","Transfer instructions in the 6510 microprocessor are used to copy the contents of one register to another. They are important because many instructions only work with the accumulator, and after executing these instructions, the contents of the source register are unchanged; the value is merely copied into the destination register."
"What is the impact of TAX instruction on the accumulator and X-register?","The TAX instruction copies the contents of the accumulator into the X-register. The Z and N flags are affected, but the original contents of the accumulator remain unchanged."
"What is the effect of TXA instruction on the X-register and accumulator?","The TXA instruction copies the contents of the X-register into the accumulator. The N and Z flags are affected, and the contents of the X-register are unchanged."
"What is the function of TAY and TYA instructions?","TAY and TYA instructions are corresponding instructions for the Y-register. They work exactly like the TAX and TXA instructions, but substituting the Y-register for the X register."
"What is the impact of TSX instruction on the X-register and stack pointer?","The TSX instruction places the contents of the stack pointer into the X-register. The Z and N flags are set according to the value, and the contents of the stack pointer remain unaltered by this operation."
"What is the effect of TXS instruction on the X-register and stack pointer?","The TXS instruction places the contents of the X-register into the stack pointer. No flags are affected by this instruction."
"What is the size of transfer instructions in the 6510 microprocessor?","All transfer instructions in the 6510 microprocessor are one-byte instructions; they need no operand."
"Is a direct transfer from the X to Y register possible in the 6510 microprocessor?","No, a direct transfer from the X to Y register or vice versa is not possible in the 6510 microprocessor. The transfer instructions require the participation of the accumulator."
"What are the pseudo-BASIC commands for transfer instructions in the 6510 microprocessor?","The pseudo-BASIC commands for transfer instructions in the 6510 microprocessor are TAX, TXA, TAY, TYA, TSX, and TXS."
"What is the purpose of the stack pointer in the 6510 microprocessor and how is it related to transfer instructions?","The stack pointer is a register in the 6510 microprocessor that is used to store data temporarily. The next two transfer instructions affect the stack pointer, and it can be exchanged only with the X-register. However, it is seldom used and discussed later in the text."
