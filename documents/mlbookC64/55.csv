question,answer
"What is a programming technique mentioned in the text?","A programming technique mentioned in the text is the use of subroutines."
"What instruction is used in BASIC to call a subroutine?","The instruction GOSUB is used in BASIC to call a subroutine."
"What is the instruction used in BASIC to return from a subroutine?","The instruction RETURN is used in BASIC to return from a subroutine."
"How is a subroutine call distinguished from a normal jump instruction?","A subroutine call is distinguished from a normal jump instruction by the fact that the processor or BASIC interpreter must make note of the location from which the subroutine was called."
"What must the processor or BASIC interpreter do when a subroutine is called?","The processor or BASIC interpreter must make note of the location from which the subroutine was called so that the RETURN instruction can branch back to the location following the call."
"What is reserved for saving the return address when a subroutine is called?","A special storage area called the stack is reserved for saving the return address when a subroutine is called."
"Where does the stack lie in memory?","The stack lies from address $0100 to $01FF (256 to 511)."
"What is used so that the microprocessor knows at which address of the stack it can save a return address?","A stack pointer is used so that the microprocessor knows at which address of the stack it can save a return address."
"What happens when a subroutine is called?","When a subroutine is called, the current contents of the program counter ( + 2) are divided into high and low bytes, and the high byte is stored at address $100 plus SP. Then the contents of the stack pointer are decremented by one and the low byte is stored on the stack, and the stack pointer is decremented by one again. Finally, a branch is made to the subroutine."
"What happens when the processor encounters an RTS instruction?","When the processor encounters an RTS instruction, the stack pointer is incremented by one and one byte is taken from the stack. This byte is used as the low-byte of the program counter. Then the stack pointer is incremented again and the high-byte of the program counter is fetched from the stack."
"What does the program counter point to when the program counter is updated after the RTS instruction?","The program counter points to the next instruction after the subroutine call."
"What happens when values are placed on the stack?","When values are placed on the stack, the value is first saved on the stack and then the stack pointer is decremented by one."
"What happens when getting a byte back from the stack?","When getting a byte back from the stack, the stack pointer is first incremented by one. The byte is then fetched from the stack."
"Which direction does the stack grow in?","The stack grows from top to bottom (from $1FF to $100)."
"What is the name of the processor mentioned in the text?","The 6510"
"What is the name of the instruction used to return from a subroutine in machine language?","The RTS instruction"
"What is the maximum size of the stack?","The stack lies from address $0100 to $01FF, so its maximum size is 256 bytes."
"What is the initial value of the stack pointer?","The initial value of the stack pointer is not specified in the text."
"What happens to the stack pointer when a value is pushed onto the stack?","The stack pointer is decremented by one when a value is pushed onto the stack."
"What happens to the stack pointer when a value is popped from the stack?","The stack pointer is incremented by one when a value is popped from the stack."
"What is the purpose of the stack?","The stack is used to store the return address when a subroutine is called."
"Is the stack a LIFO or FIFO data structure?","The stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure."
"What is the difference between a subroutine call and a normal jump instruction?","A subroutine call saves the return address on the stack, while a normal jump instruction does not."
"What is the role of the program counter in a subroutine call?","The program counter holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. When a subroutine is called, the current contents of the program counter are saved on the stack."
"What is the role of the stack pointer in a subroutine call?","The stack pointer keeps track of the top of the stack, and is used to store and retrieve values from the stack."
