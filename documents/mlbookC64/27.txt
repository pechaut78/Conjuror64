The Compare instructions
These instructions compare the contents of a register
and the contents of a memory location. These instructions
alter neither the register nor the memory contents,
affecting only the flags. You can determine the
relationship of the two numbers by examining the flags.
The compare instructions work by logically "subtracting11
the contents of the addressed memory contents from the
contents of the register and setting the flags as if an
actual subtration occurred. The register contents are not
changed. The Â£, N, and Z flags are affected depending on
the result of the "subraction". There are compare
commands for the three work registers of the
microprocessor.
