"What is absolute addressing in C64 assembly language?","Absolute addressing is a mode of addressing in C64 assembly language that is used when a register is loaded with the contents of a specific memory location. This is different from the immediate addressing mode, which loads the register with a constant value. In absolute addressing, the address of the memory location is divided into two 8-bit numbers: the least significant part (low-byte) and the most significant part (high-byte), which are stored in memory immediately following the instruction."
"How is the accumulator loaded with the contents of a memory location in absolute addressing?","In C64 assembly language, the accumulator is loaded with the contents of a memory location using the LDA (load accumulator) instruction followed by the absolute address of the memory location. For example, LDA $C0AF will load the accumulator with the contents of memory location $C0AF."
"What is the difference between absolute addressing and immediate addressing?","In absolute addressing, a register is loaded with the contents of a specific memory location, while in immediate addressing, a register is loaded with a constant value. In other words, in absolute addressing, the address of the memory location is used, while in immediate addressing, a literal value is used."
"How is a 16-bit address represented in memory in absolute addressing?","In C64 assembly language, a 16-bit address is represented in memory in absolute addressing by dividing it into two 8-bit numbers: the least significant part (low-byte) and the most significant part (high-byte). These two parts are stored in memory immediately following the instruction."
"What is the convention used for storing the two parts of a 16-bit address in memory in absolute addressing?","In C64 assembly language, the convention used for storing the two parts of a 16-bit address in memory in absolute addressing is to store the least significant part (low-byte) immediately following the instruction and the most significant part (high-byte) after the low-byte."
"What instruction is used to load the accumulator with the contents of a memory location in absolute addressing?","In C64 assembly language, the instruction used to load the accumulator with the contents of a memory location in absolute addressing is LDA (load accumulator) followed by the absolute address of the memory location."
"What is the format of the LDA instruction in absolute addressing?","In C64 assembly language, the format of the LDA instruction in absolute addressing is LDA $address, where $address is the absolute address of the memory location."
"What is the purpose of using absolute addressing in C64 assembly language?","The purpose of using absolute addressing in C64 assembly language is to load a register with the contents of a specific memory location. This is useful when the program needs to access data or code stored at a fixed memory location."
"What are the two parts of a 16-bit address in absolute addressing?","In C64 assembly language, the two parts of a 16-bit address in absolute addressing are the least significant part (low-byte) and the most significant part (high-byte)."
"How are the two parts of a 16-bit address stored in memory in absolute addressing?","In C64 assembly language, the two parts of a 16-bit address are stored in memory in absolute addressing by storing the least significant part (low-byte) immediately following the instruction and the most significant part (high-byte) after the low-byte."
