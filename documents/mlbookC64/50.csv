"What does the LSR instruction do in C64 assembly language?","The LSR (Logical Shift Right) instruction shifts the bits of a value to the right in C64 assembly language. During this process, the seventh bit is loaded with zero, and the original bit zero is placed in the carry flag."
"How does the LSR instruction differ from the ASL instruction?","The LSR instruction shifts the bits of a value to the right, while the ASL instruction shifts the bits to the left. Additionally, during an LSR operation, the seventh bit is loaded with zero, and the original bit zero is placed in the carry flag, whereas in an ASL operation, the original bit seven is placed in the carry flag and the first bit is loaded with zero."
"What happens to the seventh bit during an LSR operation?","During an LSR operation, the seventh bit is loaded with zero."
"What happens to the carry flag during an LSR operation?","During an LSR operation, the original bit zero is placed in the carry flag."
"What is the syntax for using the LSR instruction on the accumulator in C64 assembly language?","The syntax for using the LSR instruction on the accumulator in C64 assembly language is 'LSR A'."
"What value does the accumulator contain before the LSR instruction is executed in the given example?","In the given example, the accumulator contains the value $CA before the LSR instruction is executed."
"What value does the accumulator contain after the LSR instruction is executed in the given example?","In the given example, the accumulator will contain a different value after the LSR instruction is executed, as the bits have been shifted to the right."
"What is the binary representation of the value in the accumulator before the LSR instruction is executed in the given example?","The binary representation of the value $CA in the accumulator before the LSR instruction is executed in the given example is 11001010."
"What is the binary representation of the value in the accumulator after the LSR instruction is executed in the given example?","The binary representation of the value in the accumulator after the LSR instruction is executed in the given example will be different from the original representation, as the bits have been shifted to the right."
"What is the hexadecimal representation of the value in the carry flag after the LSR instruction is executed in the given example?","The hexadecimal representation of the value in the carry flag after the LSR instruction is executed in the given example is either 0 or 1, depending on the original value of bit zero before the shift."
