"What does the ROL instruction do in C64 assembly language?","The ROL (rotate left) instruction in C64 assembly language shifts the contents of a memory location or register to the left by one bit, while also cyclically shifting the carry flag. This results in a cyclical shift of nine bits, as the contents of bit 7 are placed in the carry flag, and the carry flag is shifted into bit 0."
"How does the ROL instruction affect the carry flag?","The ROL instruction shifts the contents of the carry flag into bit 0 of the memory location or register being rotated, and places the contents of bit 7 into the carry flag. This allows for a cyclical shift of nine bits."
"What is an example of using the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language?","An example of using the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language is 'ROL A', which rotates the accumulator to the left. If the accumulator contains $4B and the carry flag is set, then after executing the ROL A instruction, the accumulator will contain a new value and the carry flag will contain the original value of bit 7 from the accumulator."
"What is the result of rotating the accumulator to the left with the ROL instruction if the accumulator contains $4B and the carry flag is set?","If the accumulator contains $4B and the carry flag is set, then rotating the accumulator to the left with the ROL instruction will result in the accumulator containing a new value and the carry flag containing the original value of bit 7 from the accumulator. The exact value of the accumulator after the rotation will depend on the specific implementation of the C64 assembly language."
"What is the size of the shift performed by the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language?","The ROL instruction in C64 assembly language performs a shift of one bit to the left, but it also cyclically shifts the carry flag, resulting in a cyclical shift of nine bits (8 bits of the register plus the carry flag)."
"What happens to the contents of bit 7 when using the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language?","The contents of bit 7 of the memory location or register being rotated are placed in the carry flag when using the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language. This allows for a cyclical shift of nine bits."
"What is the effect of the ROL instruction on the memory location or register being rotated in C64 assembly language?","The ROL instruction shifts the contents of the memory location or register being rotated to the left by one bit, while also cyclically shifting the carry flag. This results in a cyclical shift of nine bits, as the contents of bit 7 are placed in the carry flag, and the contents of bit 0 are shifted into bit 7."
"What is the role of the carry flag in the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language?","The carry flag plays a crucial role in the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language, as it is shifted into bit 0 of the memory location or register being rotated, and the contents of bit 7 are placed in the carry flag. This allows for a cyclical shift of nine bits."
"What is the difference between the ROL instruction and other shift instructions in C64 assembly language?","The ROL instruction in C64 assembly language is different from other shift instructions because it not only shifts the contents of the memory location or register being rotated, but also cyclically shifts the carry flag. This results in a cyclical shift of nine bits, as the contents of bit 7 are placed in the carry flag, and the contents of bit 0 are shifted into bit 7."
"What is the purpose of the ROL instruction in C64 assembly language?","The ROL instruction in C64 assembly language is used to shift the contents of a memory location or register left cyclically, allowing for the manipulation of the bits and the carry flag. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as arithmetic operations and bit manipulation."
