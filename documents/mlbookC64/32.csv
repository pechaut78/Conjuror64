question,answer
"What is the size of branch instructions in C64 assembly language?","Branch instructions in C64 assembly language take up only two bytes in memory, providing a memory usage advantage and faster execution speed."
"What is the advantage of the faster speed of execution of branch instructions?","The faster speed of execution of branch instructions is advantageous as it leads to more efficient and quicker program execution."
"What is the principle behind relative addressing in C64 assembly language?","The principle behind relative addressing in C64 assembly language is that the branch address is relative to the point of execution, allowing for the same program segment to be placed in different memory locations without requiring changes."
"What is the disadvantage of using absolute addresses in branch instructions?","The disadvantage of using absolute addresses in branch instructions is that if the program is moved to a different memory location, the address would have to be changed, leading to additional work."
"What is the maximum address range for branching in C64 assembly language?","The maximum address range for branching in C64 assembly language is 129 bytes forward or 126 bytes backward from the branch instruction."
"Why is relative addressing not a great hindrance in practice?","Relative addressing is not a great hindrance in practice because it is seldom that a larger distance than the maximum address range is involved in branching."
"What work does the assembler take over in relative addressing?","The assembler takes over the work of address calculation in relative addressing, allowing the programmer to simply give it the branch destination."
"What does the assembler do if a jump beyond the permitted distance is attempted?","The assembler will bring it to the programmer's attention if an attempt is made to jump beyond the permitted distance in relative addressing."
"What is the size of a two-byte instruction in C64 assembly language?","A two-byte instruction in C64 assembly language is the size of a branch instruction, providing memory savings and faster execution speed."
"What is the advantage of not using absolute addresses in branch instructions?","The advantage of not using absolute addresses in branch instructions is that the branch address does not change if the program is moved to a different memory location, simplifying the programming process."
