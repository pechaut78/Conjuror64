The Transfer Instructions
The 6510 microprocessor has instructions to copy the
contents of one register to another. You can, for
example, transfer the contents of the X-register into the
accumulator or vice versa. This is quite important
because many instructions only work with the accumulator.
After executing these instructions, the contents of the
source register are unchanged; the value is merely copied
into the destination register. The transfer instructions
within the processor require the participation of the
accumulator; a direct transfer from the X to Y register
or vice versa is not possible.
All transfer instructions are one-byte instructions; they
need no operand.
Below are the individual transfer instructions and the
pseudo-BASIC commands.
TAX
The contents of the accumulator is copied into the X
register. The Z and N flags are affected, but the
original contents of the accumulator remain unchanged.
TXA A=X
The contents of the X-register is copied into the
accumulator. The N and Z flags are affected. The contents
of the X-register are unchanged.
TAY Y=A
TYA A=Y
These are the corresponding instructions for the Y-
register. They work exactly like the above instructions,
but substituting the Y-register for the X register.
The next two transfer instructions affect the stack
pointer. They are seldom used, although the stack pointer
is discussed later. The stack pointer can be exchanged
only with the X-register.
TSX X = SP
The contents of the stack pointer is placed into the X-
register. The Z and N flags are set according to the
value. The contents of the stack pointer remain unaltered
by this operation.
TXS SP = X
The contents of the X-register are placed into the stack
pointer. No flags are affected by this instruction. The
contents of the X-register are unaltered.
