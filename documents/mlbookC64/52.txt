ROL
With the ROL instruction (rotate left) we can shift a
memory location or register left cyclically, that is,
rotate the bits. The carry flag is shifted into bit 0
while the contents of bit 7 are placed in the carry.
Therefore we have a cyclical shift of nine bits (8 bits
of the register plus the carry flag). An example will
clarify this.
ROL A The accumulator contains $4B,
the carry flag is set.
