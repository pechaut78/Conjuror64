The CPX instruction
The CPX instruction works the same way as the CMP
instruction. Here the contents of the addressed memory
location are compared not with the contents of
the
accumulator, but rather with the contents of the X-
register. The contents of the registers are not altered.
What was said above concerning the CMP instruction
applies to the CPX instruction as well. There are not as
many addressing modes for the CPX instruction, however.
