The stack pointer points to an area of memory called the
stack which is used for subroutines and for short-term data
storage. The stack is described in detail later.
The processor status register gives information about the
result of the last executed instruction. This register is
the foundation for the decision making and conditional
branching instructions. Seven of the eight bits of the
status register are used as flags. You can examine and
conditionally branch depending on the setting of a
particular flag. A flag can be either set (=1) or clear
(=0).
