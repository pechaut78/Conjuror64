"What are the four flags used to make decisions in 6510 microprocessor?","The four flags used to make decisions in 6510 microprocessor are the Z flag, the N flag, the C flag, and the V flag. These flags are used to determine the conditions for conditional branching."
"What is the purpose of conditional branch commands in 6510 microprocessor?","The purpose of conditional branch commands in 6510 microprocessor is to make programming decisions based on the conditions of the flags. Each flag has two conditional branch commands, one that branches if the flag is set and another that branches if the flag is clear."
"What is the operand of conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor?","The operand of conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor is the location where the microprocessor is to get the next operation code should the condition tested for be true. It is not an absolute memory address but rather an address relative to the current contents of the program counter."
"What addressing mode is used for conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor?","The 6510 microprocessor uses the relative addressing mode for conditional branch instructions. This means that the operand is not an absolute memory address but rather an address relative to the current contents of the program counter."
"How is the relative address computed in conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor?","The relative address is computed by adding the 8-bit value of the relative address to the contents of the program counter. If the condition tested for is true, the branch is made to the computed address."
"What is the range of relative addressing in conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor?","With the 8-bit value of the relative address, you can represent 256 different numbers, so you can branch to any of 256 possible locations in conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor."
"What is the effect of the relative address on the branch direction in conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor?","The relative address causes a branch forward if the 8-bit value is positive and causes a branch backward if the 8-bit value is negative. So relative addressing can perform backward branching by allowing the use of negative operands in conditional branch instructions in 6510 microprocessor."
"What are the two types of conditional branch commands for each flag in 6510 microprocessor?","For each flag in 6510 microprocessor, there are two types of conditional branch commands: the first branches if the flag is set, the second if the flag is clear."
"What is the purpose of the Z flag in conditional branch commands in 6510 microprocessor?","The Z flag in conditional branch commands in 6510 microprocessor is used to test if a result is zero or not. It is one of the four flags used in conditional branch commands."
"What is the purpose of the N flag in conditional branch commands in 6510 microprocessor?","The N flag in conditional branch commands in 6510 microprocessor is used to test if the result is negative or not. It is one of the four flags used in conditional branch commands."
