 Conditional branching instructions
Next we introduce the instructions that allow you to make
programming decisions. The foundations of these decisions
are the conditions of the flags. The following four flags
can be used to make decisions: the Z flag, the N flag,
the C flag, and the V flag.
For each flag there are two conditional branch commands:
the first branches if the flag is set, the second if the
flag is clear. The operand of each conditional branch
instruction specifies the location where the micro
processor is to get the next operation code should the
condition tested for be true.
The 6510 microprocessor uses the relative addressing mode
for conditional branch instructions. The operand is not
an absolute memory address, but rather an address
relative to the current contents of the program counter.
This relative address is an 8-bit value. The relative
address is added to the contents of the program counter
and the branch is made to that computed address if the
condition tested for is true.
With this 8-bit value you can represent 256 different
numbers, so you can branch to any of 256 possible
locations. The relative address causes a branch forward
if the 8-bit value is positive and causes a branch
backward if the 8-bit value is negative. So relative
addressing can perform backward branching by allowing the
use of negative operands.
