A. The LOAD instructions
The LOAD instructions get data from memory and place it
into a register. There are three working registers in the
processor (the accumulator, the X-register and the Y-
register). Each has a corresponding load instructions.
LDA LoaD Accumulator
LDX LoaD X register
LDY LoaD Y register
The 6510 processor has different addressing modes. An
addressing mode tells the 6510 how to calculate the
address (or location) of the operand.
In the examples that follow, we show you corresponding
"pseudo-BASIC" statements to illustrate the machine
langauge instructions in a familiar notation.
1) Immediate Addressing
LDA #10
This addressing mode is indicated by the pound sign
# preceding the value to be loaded. Immediate
addressing means that the accumulator is loaded
with the value which follows it, in this case 10.
The corresponding pseudo-BASIC instruction is:
A=10
