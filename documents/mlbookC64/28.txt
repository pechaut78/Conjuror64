The CMP instruction
This instruction compares the contents of the accumulator
with the contents of the addressed memory location, by
logically subtracting the contents of the operand from
the accumulator. If an underflow occurs, the carry flag
is cleared; otherwise it is set. If the result is zero,
the Z flag is set; otherwise it is cleared. If the result
is greater than $7F (127), the N flag is set, otherwise
it is cleared. Let us take a look at an example:
LDA #$50
CMP #$30
The accumulator contains $50. The calculation $50 - $30
is then carried out, with a result of $20. Because no
underflow occurred, the carry flag is set. The zero flag
is cleared because the result is not equal to zero. The N
flag is cleared because the number is not greater than
$7F. We get the following result:
C=l; Z=0; N=0
