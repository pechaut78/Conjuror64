"What is indexed addressing in the context of the C64 assembly language?","Indexed addressing is a way to calculate memory addresses in C64 assembly language. It involves adding the contents of an index register (in this case, the X-register) to a base address to form the final memory address that will be accessed. This allows for more complex addressing patterns and can make it easier to access large arrays or tables of data."
"What is the syntax for indexed addressing in C64 assembly language?","The syntax for indexed addressing in C64 assembly language is to follow the base address with the letter X and a greater than symbol (>). For example, to load the accumulator (A) with the value stored at the memory address formed by adding the contents of the X-register to the base address of $BA, you would use the instruction LDA $BAfX>."
"What are the advantages of using indexed addressing with zero-page addressing in C64 assembly language?","Using indexed addressing with zero-page addressing in C64 assembly language combines the advantages of both addressing modes. Zero-page addressing allows for faster access to memory locations, while indexed addressing allows for more complex addressing patterns. This can be useful for accessing large arrays or tables of data that are stored in zero-page memory."
"What is the purpose of the X-register in indexed addressing in C64 assembly language?","The X-register is used as the index register in indexed addressing in C64 assembly language. It holds the value that will be added to the base address to form the final memory address that will be accessed."
"What is an example of an instruction that uses indexed addressing in C64 assembly language?","An example of an instruction that uses indexed addressing in C64 assembly language is LDA $BAfX>. This instruction loads the accumulator (A) with the value stored at the memory address formed by adding the contents of the X-register to the base address of $BA."
"What is the difference between indexed addressing and zero-page addressing in C64 assembly language?","Indexed addressing and zero-page addressing are both ways to calculate memory addresses in C64 assembly language. Indexed addressing involves adding the contents of an index register (in this case, the X-register) to a base address to form the final memory address. Zero-page addressing involves accessing memory locations that are located in the first 256 bytes of memory (addresses $0000-$00FF). Indexed addressing can be used with zero-page addressing to form indexed zero-page addressing, which combines the advantages of both addressing modes."
"Is it possible to use indexed addressing with the Y-register in C64 assembly language?","No, it is not possible to use indexed addressing with the Y-register in C64 assembly language. Indexed addressing can only be used with the X-register."
"What is the size of the index register (X-register) in C64 assembly language?","The index register (X-register) in C64 assembly language is 8 bits wide, which means it can hold a value between 0 and 255 (in decimal)."
"What is the range of memory addresses that can be accessed using indexed addressing in C64 assembly language?","The range of memory addresses that can be accessed using indexed addressing in C64 assembly language is determined by the range of the base address and the range of the index register (X-register). For example, if the base address is $BA and the X-register holds the value 5, the final memory address that will be accessed will be $BA + 5 = $BB."
"What is the purpose of the greater than symbol (>) in the syntax for indexed addressing in C64 assembly language?","The purpose of the greater than symbol (>) in the syntax for indexed addressing in C64 assembly language is to indicate that indexed addressing is being used. It follows the base address and the letter X, which indicates that the X-register is being used as the index register. The greater than symbol tells the assembler to calculate the final memory address by adding the contents of the X-register to the base address."
