ROR
The ROR instruction (rotate right) is the opposite of the
ROL instruction and rotates the contents of a register
cyclically one position to the right. In so doing, the
contents of the carry flag are placed into the now-free
position 7 while the pushed-out contents of bit 0 are
placed into the carry flag.
