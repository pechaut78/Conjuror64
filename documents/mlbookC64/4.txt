C -Carry The carry flag contains the carry generated
by an addition, and is set if the result is greater
than 255 and therefore cannot be contained in eight
bits of the accumulator.
Z - Zero The zero flag is set if the result of an
operation is zero.
I- Interrupt Disable This flag determines if
interrupts are permitted in a program. This flag
does not interest us at the moment.
D -Decimal The decimal flag determines if arithmetic
is carried out in the decimal mode.
B -Break The break flag indicates if execution was
halted by a BRK instruction.
V-overflow The V flag indicates overflow when
calculating with signed numbers.
N -Negative This flag is set if the result of an
operation results in a value greater than 127 (bit
7 is set). The designation negative comes from the
fact that values over $7F can be interpreted as
negative numbers.
