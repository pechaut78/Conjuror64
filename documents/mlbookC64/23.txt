The logical instructions
The logical instructions combine two value with each
other. As with the arithmetic instructions, one operand
must be in the accumulator while the second is retrieved
from memory according to the addressing mode. After the
operation, the result is left in the accumulator. The
6510 can perform three different types of logical
