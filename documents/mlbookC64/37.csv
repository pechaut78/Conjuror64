"What is the main difference between unconditional jump instructions and conditional branch commands in C64 assembly language?","Unconditional jump instructions in C64 assembly language always branch to an absolute address, whereas conditional branch commands depend on a condition and may or may not be executed. Additionally, unconditional jump instructions specify the destination address directly, while conditional branch commands specify a relative offset from the current address."
"What is the format of specifying the destination address in unconditional jump instructions in C64 assembly language?","In C64 assembly language, the destination address in unconditional jump instructions is specified in reverse sequence (low-byte followed by high-byte)."
"What is the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language?","The indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language is a peculiarity where the specified address tells where to get the actual destination address, instead of jumping to the specified address directly. This form uses two consecutive bytes as a pointer in the format low byte, high byte."
"What is the difference between the absolute form and indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language?","In the absolute form of the jump instruction, the specified address is jumped to, while in the indirect addressing form, the specified address tells where to get the actual destination address. This method of addressing works only with the JMP instruction."
"How does the operating system of the Commodore 64 use the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions?","The operating system of the Commodore 64 uses several addresses called vectors, located from $300 to $33C, that contain addresses for indirect JMPs. These vectors are used for performing frequently used routines."
"What is the format of the vectors used by the operating system of the Commodore 64 for indirect JMPs?","The vectors used by the operating system of the Commodore 64 for indirect JMPs are located from $300 to $33C and contain addresses for indirect JMPs. These vectors use the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions, where the specified address tells where to get the actual destination address."
"What is the purpose of the vectors used by the operating system of the Commodore 64 for indirect JMPs?","The purpose of the vectors used by the operating system of the Commodore 64 for indirect JMPs is to contain addresses for indirect JMPs and to be used for performing frequently used routines."
"What is the format of the actual address taken from memory locations in the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language?","In the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language, the actual address is taken from memory locations using two consecutive bytes as a pointer, in the format low byte, high byte."
"What is an example of the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language?","An example of the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language is JMP ($0302), where if $40 and $C8 are in these locations, a branch to location $C840 will be made."
"What is the use of the indirect addressing form of the jump instructions in C64 assembly language in the operating system of the Commodore 64?","The indirect addressing form of the jump instructions is used in the operating system of the Commodore 64 to contain addresses for indirect JMPs and to be used for performing frequently used routines. This allows for efficient and flexible code execution in the operating system."
