3. Instructions and Addressing Modes of the 6510
Of the 256 possible 8-bit codes, 151 are legal instructions
for the 6510, These include several similar instructions,
that are different only by addressing mode. There are only
56 entirely different instructions on the 6510. These
instructions are easy to learn. They are introduced to you
in groups.
An instruction is represented in the computer as an 8-bit
binary number. Each particular machine language instruction
has a specific binary value. The microprocessor knows what
actions to take based on this binary value.
Machine language instructions are given mnemonic-names. A
mnemonic is a three character abbreviation for a machine
language operation. For example, the mnemonic LDA stands for
loaD Accumulator.
