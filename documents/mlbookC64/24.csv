"What is the purpose of the AND instruction in C64 assembly language?","The AND instruction in C64 assembly language performs a bit-wise comparison of the accumulator and an operand. It compares each bit of the accumulator with the corresponding bit in the operand. If both bits are set to 1, the corresponding bit of the result is also set to one."
"How does the AND instruction handle different bit combinations?","The AND instruction handles different bit combinations as follows: 0 AND 0 = 0, 0 AND 1 = 0, 1 AND 0 = 0, and 1 AND 1 = 1."
"What is an example of using the AND instruction in C64 assembly language?","An example of using the AND instruction in C64 assembly language is AND #$37. This instruction performs a bit-wise comparison of the accumulator and the value $37."
"What is the result of the comparison if both bits are not set in the AND instruction?","If both bits are not set in the AND instruction, the corresponding bit of the result will be set to zero."
"What is the advantage of using the AND instruction in C64 assembly language?","The advantage of using the AND instruction in C64 assembly language is that it allows for bit-wise comparison of the accumulator and an operand, which can be useful for certain operations such as checking specific bits in a value."
"How does the AND instruction affect the accumulator in C64 assembly language?","The AND instruction affects the accumulator in C64 assembly language by performing a bit-wise comparison of the accumulator and an operand, and storing the result back into the accumulator."
"What is the syntax of the AND instruction in C64 assembly language?","The syntax of the AND instruction in C64 assembly language is AND <operand>. The operand can be a value, a register, or a memory location."
"What is the difference between the AND instruction and the OR instruction in C64 assembly language?","The AND instruction in C64 assembly language performs a bit-wise comparison of the accumulator and an operand, while the OR instruction performs a bit-wise logical OR operation between the accumulator and an operand."
"What is the use of the AND instruction in C64 assembly language in the context of checking specific bits in a value?","The AND instruction in C64 assembly language can be used to check specific bits in a value by performing a bit-wise comparison of the value and a mask. The result will have the bits set that were set in both the value and the mask."
"What is the effect of the AND instruction on the negative flag in C64 assembly language?","The AND instruction does not affect the negative flag in C64 assembly language, as it only performs a bit-wise comparison of the accumulator and an operand, and does not affect the sign of the result."
