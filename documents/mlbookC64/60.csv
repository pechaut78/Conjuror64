"What is the opposite of PHP in 6502 assembly language?","PLP stands for Push Logical Status Register, which stores the status flags on the stack. The opposite of PHP (Push Processor Status) is PLP, which fetches one byte from the stack and places it in the status register. This operation is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
"What does PLP do in 6502 assembly language?","PLP is an assembly language instruction in 6502 that fetches one byte from the stack and places it in the status register. It is the opposite of PHP (Push Processor Status), which pushes the status flags onto the stack. PLP is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
"How does PLP differ from PHP in 6502 assembly language?","PLP (Pull Logical Status Register) and PHP (Push Processor Status) are two assembly language instructions in 6502 that deal with the status flags. While PHP pushes the status flags onto the stack, PLP fetches one byte from the stack and places it in the status register. In other words, PHP stores the current status flags, while PLP restores the previous status flags."
"What is the purpose of PLP in 6502 assembly language?","PLP (Pull Logical Status Register) is an assembly language instruction in 6502 that retrieves the previous status flags from the stack and stores them in the status register. It is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values. PLP is the opposite of PHP (Push Processor Status), which pushes the status flags onto the stack."
"What is the function of PLP in 6502 assembly language?","PLP (Pull Logical Status Register) is an assembly language instruction in 6502 that retrieves the previous status flags from the stack and stores them in the status register. Its function is to restore the previous status flags that were saved by PHP (Push Processor Status) or by an interrupt. PLP is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
"What is the operation of PLP in 6502 assembly language?","PLP (Pull Logical Status Register) is an assembly language instruction in 6502 that retrieves one byte from the stack and places it in the status register. This operation is the opposite of PHP (Push Processor Status), which pushes the status flags onto the stack. PLP is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
"What does PLP stand for in 6502 assembly language?","PLP stands for Pull Logical Status Register, which is an assembly language instruction in 6502 that retrieves the previous status flags from the stack and stores them in the status register. It is the opposite of PHP (Push Processor Status), which pushes the status flags onto the stack. PLP is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
"How does PLP affect the status register in 6502 assembly language?","PLP (Pull Logical Status Register) is an assembly language instruction in 6502 that retrieves one byte from the stack and places it in the status register. This operation affects the status register by restoring the previous status flags that were saved by PHP (Push Processor Status) or by an interrupt. PLP is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
"What is the syntax of PLP in 6502 assembly language?","The syntax of PLP in 6502 assembly language is simply PLP. It is a single-byte instruction that fetches one byte from the stack and places it in the status register. PLP is the opposite of PHP (Push Processor Status), which pushes the status flags onto the stack. PLP is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
"What is the effect of PLP on the stack in 6502 assembly language?","PLP (Pull Logical Status Register) is an assembly language instruction in 6502 that retrieves one byte from the stack and places it in the status register. This operation affects the stack by decrementing the stack pointer (S) and retrieving the previous status flags that were saved by PHP (Push Processor Status) or by an interrupt. PLP is useful when a subroutine modifies the status flags and the calling routine needs to know the original flag values."
