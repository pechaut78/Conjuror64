The decimal flag
This flag determines whether
the processor performs
addition and subtraction in binary (indicated by a
cleared flag, as we have already learned) or in binary-
coded decimal (BCD). This is the case if the flag is set.
The microprocessor then works with BCD numbers. The
instruction SED (set decimal) sets the flag, CLD (clear
decimal) clears the flag.
