The Increment and Decrement instructions
For effective programming of loops and counters, the 6510
has commands to increment or decrement the contents of a
register or memory location by one. These increment
instructions correspond, together with the conditional
branching commands, to the NEXT instruction in BASIC. The
STEP-1 instruction can be simulated with the decrement
commands.
