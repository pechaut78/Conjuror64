The AND instruction
The AND operation compares each bit of the accumulator
with the corresponding bit in the operand. If the bit of
the accumulator AND the corresponding bit of the operand
are both set (to l)f the corresponding bit of the result
is also set to one.
0 AND 0=0
0 AND 1=0
1 AND 0=0
1 AND 1=1
The bit-wise comparison of the accumulator and operand
can be made clearer with an example.
