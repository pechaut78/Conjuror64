"What is the difference between indexed indirect addressing and indirect indexed addressing in 6502 assembly?","Indexed indirect addressing uses the X-register and adds it to a pointer stored in zero-page memory, then uses the result as a pointer to the actual address. In contrast, indirect indexed addressing uses the Y-register and adds it to the contents of the address pointed to by a zero-page pointer."
"What register is used in indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly?","The X-register is used in indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly."
"What two consecutive zero-page locations are used in indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly?","In indexed indirect addressing, two consecutive zero-page locations are used to form the address. The index is added to the pointer stored in these locations, and the result is used as a pointer to the actual address."
"What is the role of the pointer in indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly?","In indexed indirect addressing, the pointer stored in two consecutive zero-page locations is used as a starting point. The index is added to this pointer, and the result is used as a pointer to the actual address."

In contrast, indirect addressing uses the contents of the address pointed to by a zero-page pointer as the actual address. The Y-register is used in indirect addressing."
"What is the role of the index in indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly?","In indexed indirect addressing, the index is added to the pointer stored in two consecutive zero-page locations. The result is used as a pointer to the actual address."
"What is the syntax for indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly?","The syntax for indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly is (zp,X), where zp is the zero-page address of the pointer and X is the index."
"What is the difference between indexed indirect addressing and (zp),Y addressing modes in 6502 assembly?","Indexed indirect addressing adds the index to the pointer stored in two consecutive zero-page locations and uses the result as a pointer to the actual address. On the other hand, (zp),Y uses the contents of the address pointed to by a zero-page pointer as the actual address and adds the Y-register to the contents of the address."
"What is the role of the contents of the zero-page locations in indexed indirect addressing in 6502 assembly?","The contents of the two consecutive zero-page locations are used as a pointer in indexed indirect addressing. The index is added to this pointer, and the result is used as a pointer to the actual address."
