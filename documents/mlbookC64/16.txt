Indirect indexed addressing is indicated by placing
the operand in parentheses. This addressing mode is
very efficient, because you can access the entire
memory with a two-byte instruction. This mode is
used for managing tables and loops. It is more
flexible than the simple indexed addressing,
because the entire memory range can be addressed,
not just the memory in a single page. Only the
contents of the two-byte pointer in the zero page
need be changed.
