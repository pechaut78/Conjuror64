ROL
All bits are shifted one position to the left. The carry
flag is transferred into the now-vacant bit 0. The
pushed-out seventh bit is placed into the carry. We get a
result of $97 and a cleared carry. Here again the
contents of the accumulator are doubled; any overflow is
placed into the carry.
