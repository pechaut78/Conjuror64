The STORE Instructions
The counterparts of the load instructions are the store
instructions. Using these instructions we can place the
contents of a register into memory. The mnemonics for the
instructions are:
STA
STX
STY
The contents of the accumulator, X-register or Y-register
are placed in the appropriate memory location, which is
specified by the operand that follows the instruction
code. The same addressing modes used for the load
instructions apply to these instructions except for the
immediate mode. Storing the contents of a register
changes neither the register nor the status flags.
