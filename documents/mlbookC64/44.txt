Flag manipulation instructions
In addition to the instructions whose results affect the
flags, the flags can also be directly set or cleared by
the programmer. Sometimes this is necessary before
performing addition and subtraction. These instructions
do not require any operands. They are all one-byte in
length.


The carry flag
The carry flag is set by the instruction SEC (set carry)/
and cleared by CLC (clear carry).
The SEC instruction must be used before each subtraction
and the CLC instruction before
each addition, otherwise
the answer may be wrong.
