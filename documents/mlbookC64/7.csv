"What does the LDA instruction do in C64 assembly language?","The LDA (LoaD Accumulator) instruction in C64 assembly language is used to load a value into the accumulator register. The accumulator is one of the three working registers in the 6510 processor and is used for arithmetic and logical operations."
"What is the purpose of the # symbol in C64 assembly language?","The # symbol in C64 assembly language is used to indicate immediate addressing mode. When it precedes a value, it means that the accumulator is loaded with the value that follows it, and not the address of the value."
"What is the difference between immediate addressing mode and other addressing modes in C64 assembly language?","In immediate addressing mode, the value itself is loaded into the register, whereas in other addressing modes, the address of the value is loaded into the register. This means that in immediate addressing mode, the value is directly available for use, whereas in other addressing modes, an additional memory access is required to retrieve the value."
"What are the three working registers in the 6510 processor?","The three working registers in the 6510 processor are the accumulator, the X-register, and the Y-register. These registers are used for storing data and performing arithmetic and logical operations."
"What is the purpose of the LOAD instructions in C64 assembly language?","The LOAD instructions in C64 assembly language are used to load data from memory into a register. This is useful for moving data around in memory, and for loading data into registers before performing arithmetic or logical operations."
"What is the corresponding pseudo-BASIC instruction for LDA #10 in C64 assembly language?","The corresponding pseudo-BASIC instruction for LDA #10 in C64 assembly language is A=10. This means that the value 10 is loaded into the accumulator register."
"What is the function of the 6510 processor in C64 assembly language?","The 6510 processor is the central processing unit (CPU) of the C64 computer. It is responsible for executing instructions and managing data in memory. The 6510 processor has different addressing modes, which determine how it calculates the address of the operand (the data being loaded or stored)."
"What does the LDX instruction do in C64 assembly language?","The LDX (LoaD X register) instruction in C64 assembly language is used to load a value into the X-register. The X-register is one of the three working registers in the 6510 processor, and is used for storing data and performing arithmetic and logical operations."
"What does the LDY instruction do in C64 assembly language?","The LDY (LoaD Y register) instruction in C64 assembly language is used to load a value into the Y-register. The Y-register is one of the three working registers in the 6510 processor, and is used for storing data and performing arithmetic and logical operations."
"What are addressing modes in C64 assembly language?","Addressing modes in C64 assembly language are ways of specifying how the 6510 processor should calculate the address of the operand. There are different addressing modes, such as immediate addressing mode, which is indicated by the # symbol, and other addressing modes, which require the use of memory addresses."
