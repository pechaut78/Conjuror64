"What is the zero-page addressing mode in 6502 assembly language?","The zero-page addressing mode is an addressing mode in 6502 assembly language that can be used if the address of the data is in memory locations between 0 and $FF (255). This addressing mode results in a two-byte instruction, which occupies less memory and executes faster than the three-byte instruction of the absolute addressing mode."
"What is the advantage of using zero-page addressing mode?","The advantage of using zero-page addressing mode is that it occupies less memory and executes faster than the absolute addressing mode. However, the data must be located in addresses from 0 to 255."
"What is the disadvantage of using zero-page addressing mode?","The disadvantage of using zero-page addressing mode is that the data must be located in addresses from 0 to 255."
"What is the origin of the term zero-page in 6502 assembly language?","The term zero-page originated from the fact that the 64K of memory is divided into 256 pages, each containing 256 bytes. Thus, memory locations 0 thru 255 form page zero."
"What does a zero-page load instruction look like in 6502 assembly language?","A zero-page load instruction in 6502 assembly language looks like this: LDA $73>"
"What is the size of a zero-page addressing mode instruction in 6502 assembly language?","A zero-page addressing mode instruction in 6502 assembly language is a two-byte instruction."
"What is the size of an absolute addressing mode instruction in 6502 assembly language?","An absolute addressing mode instruction in 6502 assembly language is a three-byte instruction."
"What is the difference in size between a zero-page addressing mode instruction and an absolute addressing mode instruction in 6502 assembly language?","A zero-page addressing mode instruction is a two-byte instruction, while an absolute addressing mode instruction is a three-byte instruction. Therefore, the zero-page addressing mode instruction is one byte smaller than the absolute addressing mode instruction."
"What is the difference in execution time between a zero-page addressing mode instruction and an absolute addressing mode instruction in 6502 assembly language?","A zero-page addressing mode instruction executes faster than an absolute addressing mode instruction in 6502 assembly language."
"What is the maximum memory location that can be used in the zero-page addressing mode in 6502 assembly language?","The maximum memory location that can be used in the zero-page addressing mode in 6502 assembly language is $FF (255)."
