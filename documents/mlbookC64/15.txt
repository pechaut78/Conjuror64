Indirect Indexed Addressing
This addressing mode is not as easy to understand,
but permits very flexible programming -the indirect
indexed addressing mode. Using this addressing
mode, zero page plays an important role. With
indirect indexed addressing, two consecutive memory
locations in zero-page form a pointer to the actual
address. The first memory cell contains the low-
byte and the next contains the high-byte of theT
actual address.
