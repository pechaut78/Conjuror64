"What flag in the 6502 processor can only be cleared with a specific instruction?","The overflow flag (V) in the 6502 processor can only be cleared using the CLV (clear overflow) instruction. This flag is used to indicate whether an arithmetic operation resulted in a signed overflow."
"How can you clear the overflow flag (V) in 6502 assembly language?","To clear the overflow flag (V) in 6502 assembly language, you can use the CLV (clear overflow) instruction. This is the only way to reset the overflow flag, as it cannot be affected by arithmetic operations or other instructions."
"What is the purpose of the CLV instruction in 6502 assembly language?","The CLV instruction in 6502 assembly language is used to clear the overflow flag (V). This flag is set when an arithmetic operation results in a signed overflow, and it can only be cleared using the CLV instruction."
"Can the overflow flag (V) be affected by arithmetic operations in 6502 assembly language?","No, the overflow flag (V) cannot be affected by arithmetic operations in 6502 assembly language. It can only be set or cleared using the appropriate instructions (e.g. ADC or CLV)."
"What is the only way to clear the overflow flag (V) in 6502 assembly language?","The only way to clear the overflow flag (V) in 6502 assembly language is by using the CLV (clear overflow) instruction. This flag cannot be affected by arithmetic operations or other instructions."
"What is the function of the CLV instruction in 6502 assembly language?","The CLV instruction in 6502 assembly language is used to clear the overflow flag (V). This flag is used to indicate whether an arithmetic operation resulted in a signed overflow, and it can only be cleared using the CLV instruction."
"Can the overflow flag (V) be affected by other instructions besides arithmetic operations in 6502 assembly language?","No, the overflow flag (V) can only be affected by arithmetic operations (e.g. ADC) or the CLV instruction in 6502 assembly language. It cannot be affected by other instructions."
