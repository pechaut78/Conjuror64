Instructions for handling interrupts
We are not going to use use these instructions but
mention them only for the sake of completeness. The 6510
has the ability to interrupt a program from the outside
world. For this, the interrupt line (IRQ, interrupt
request) of the processor must be activated. The
interrupt procedure is similar to a subroutine call. The
processor interrupts the current program and places the
contents of the program counter and the status register
on the stack. Now execution branches to the address
contained at $FFFE and $FFFF. The contents of these
addresses are used as the new program counter.
In addition to an interruption from the outside, the 6510
can also interrupt a program through a instruction from
within the program. The instruction BRK (break) serves
this purpose. The program counter and the status register
are saved on the stack.
In order to return to the main program from an interrupt
routine, there is a instruction similar to the RTS
instruction for subroutines. The instruction RTI (return
from interrupt) gets the program counter and the contents
of the status register back from the stack so that the
program can continue without changing the flags.
