LDX #$7F or LDY #0
Here the X-register is loaded with the value $7F
(127 in decimal) and the Y-register with the value
zero (0).
When using the immediate addressing mode, the value
to be loaded is part of the program. The
instruction and the value are placed one after the
other in two adjacent memory locations. For
example, if the machine language program is located
at address 1200, the program counter contains the
value 1200. The 6510 microprocessor gets the
intruction at 1200 and sees that its value is $A9
or decimal 169. It knows that the instruction is
LDA #. So it places the contents contained in the
next memory location 1201 into the accumulator (see
diagram which follows). Since this instruction
consists of two bytes - the instruction itself and
the value to be loaded - the processor
automatically increments the program counter by
two. The program counter then points to the next
instruction to be executed by the microprocessor
starting at 1202,
