2) Absolute Addressing
This addressing mode is used if a register is be
loaded with the contents of a particular memory
location. This is different from the immediate
addressing mode which loads the register with a
constant value.
LDA $C0AF
Here the accumulator is loaded with the contents of
memory location $C0AF. How is this instruction
represented in memory? The address $C0AF is a 16-
bit number. A memory location can only hold 8 bits.
The solution is to divide the 16-bit address into
two 8-bit numbers. The following convention is used
for this - immediately following the instruction is
the least significant part of the address (low-
byte) and followed by the the most significant part
(high-byte).
