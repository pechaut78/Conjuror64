question,answer
"What is the purpose of memory in a microprocessor?","Memory in a microprocessor is used to store and retrieve data. It is divided into individual cells, each containing 8 bits, the same size as the accumulator and X and Y registers. Memory locations can be selected through a process called addressing memory."
"What is addressing memory?","Addressing memory is the process of selecting a specific memory location by assigning a number or address to each location."
"How many memory cells can be addressed with 8 bits in a microprocessor?","With 8 bits, a microprocessor can address 256 memory cells, from 0 to 255."
"Why is 16 bits used for addressing memory in a microprocessor?","16 bits are used for addressing memory in a microprocessor in order to access a larger number of memory locations, specifically 65536."
"What is a 16-bit address bus?","A 16-bit address bus refers to the microprocessor's ability to address 65536 memory locations using 16 bits."
"How many memory locations can the 6510 microprocessor address?","The 6510 microprocessor can address 65536 memory locations."
"What is the significance of the program counter in a microprocessor?","The program counter contains a 16-bit value that is the address of the next instruction that the microprocessor is to fetch from memory and execute."
"How many different instructions can a microprocessor have?","A microprocessor can have a maximum of 256 different instructions, although not all codes have a meaning on the 6510 and fewer than 256 instructions exist."
"Are BASIC commands included as instructions in a microprocessor?","No, BASIC commands are not included as instructions in a microprocessor."
"What is a kilobyte or IK in a microprocessor?","210 = 1024 bytes is called a kilobyte or IK in a microprocessor, and it is used for ease of handling."
