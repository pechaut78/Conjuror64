To add two 16-bit numbers, add the low-bytes of each
operand and then the high-bytes of each operand. If an
overflow occurs during the addition of the low-bytes,
the carry flag adjusts for this during the addition of
the high-bytes. Remember to clear the carry flag before
adding the low-bytes so that the previous contents of the
carry flag do not affect the addition. Here is an example
of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being
placed in SUM:
CLC  ;clear carry flag
LDA NUM1LOW   ;low half of NUM1
ADC NUM2LOW   ;low half of NUM2
STA SUMLOW    ;low half of result
LDA NUM1HIGH  ;high half of NUMl
ADC NUM2HIGH  ;high half of NUM2
STA SUMHIGH   ;high half of result
