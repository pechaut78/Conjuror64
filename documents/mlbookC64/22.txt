Subtraction is
performed
in much
the same
way as
addition. The contents of the addressed memory location
is subtracted from the accumulator and the result is left
in the accumulator. It is possible that the result cannot
be represented in 8-bits. With subtraction, an overflow
cannot occur, only an underflow. In this case, the result
is less than zero. The carry flag indicates this too.
Since overflow and underflow have opposite meanings,
underflow is indicated by carry flag being cleared. A
carry flag being set means that no underflow has
occurred. Correspondingly, the carry flag must be set
prior to subtraction (or the first byte of multi-
precision subtraction).
