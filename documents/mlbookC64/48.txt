The Shift Instructions
The 6510 microprocessor has some instructions for which
there are no equivalents in BASIC: the shift
instructions. These instructions shift the bits in the
accumulator or addressed memory location one position to
the right or left. If these instructions are used in
reference to the accumulator, one speaks of accumulator
addressing. Depending on the addressing mode, these
commands can consist of one, two, or three bytes. If a
memory location is addressed, they behave as an INC or
DEC instruction by following a read with a write. The
contents of the accumulator remain unchanged by this
addressing mode.
