INX
The contents of the X register are incremented by one.
The N and Z flags are set according to the result. InINY
This is the corresponding instruction to increment the Y
register. It affects the flags in the same way.
BASIC, this instruction can be formulated:
X=X+1
If a value of $FF is incremented, the overflow is not
taken into account (the carry flag is not set). The
contents are set to zero, and the Z flag is set.
