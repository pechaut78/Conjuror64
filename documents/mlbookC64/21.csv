"How do you add two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly?","To add two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly, you need to add the low-bytes of each operand and then the high-bytes of each operand. Before adding the low-bytes, you should clear the carry flag using the CLC instruction. This ensures that the previous contents of the carry flag do not affect the addition. If an overflow occurs during the addition of the low-bytes, the carry flag adjusts for this during the addition of the high-bytes. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"What is the purpose of clearing the carry flag before adding the low-bytes of two 16-bit numbers?","Clearing the carry flag before adding the low-bytes of two 16-bit numbers ensures that the previous contents of the carry flag do not affect the addition. This is important because the carry flag may have been set or cleared by a previous operation, and we want to start with a known state before adding the low-bytes. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"What happens if an overflow occurs during the addition of the low-bytes of two 16-bit numbers?","If an overflow occurs during the addition of the low-bytes of two 16-bit numbers, the carry flag adjusts for this during the addition of the high-bytes. This ensures that the final result is correct, even if an overflow occurred during the low-byte addition. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"What is the role of the carry flag in adding two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly?","The carry flag plays an important role in adding two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly. If an overflow occurs during the addition of the low-bytes, the carry flag adjusts for this during the addition of the high-bytes. This ensures that the final result is correct, even if an overflow occurred during the low-byte addition. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"How do you store the result of adding two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly?","To store the result of adding two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly, you need to store the low-byte result in a memory location reserved for the low half of the result, and the high-byte result in a memory location reserved for the high half of the result. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"What is the purpose of adding the low-bytes of two 16-bit numbers before adding the high-bytes?","Adding the low-bytes of two 16-bit numbers before adding the high-bytes ensures that the low-byte addition is performed first, and any overflow is carried over to the high-byte addition. This is important because the low-byte addition may result in a carry that needs to be added to the high-byte addition. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"What is the role of the ADC instruction in adding two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly?","The ADC (Add with Carry) instruction is used to add two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly. It adds the contents of the accumulator (A) to the contents of a memory location or immediate value, and takes into account the carry flag. This is important because the carry flag may have been set or cleared by a previous operation, and we want to include its value in the addition. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"What is the syntax of the ADC instruction in 6502 assembly?","The syntax of the ADC (Add with Carry) instruction in 6502 assembly is as follows: ADC <operand> The <operand> can be a memory location, a register, or an immediate value. The ADC instruction adds the contents of the accumulator (A) to the <operand>, and takes into account the carry flag. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
"What is the role of the LDA instruction in adding two 16-bit numbers in 6502 assembly?","The LDA (Load Accumulator) instruction is used to load a value into the accumulator (A) in 6502 assembly. In the context of adding two 16-bit numbers, the LDA instruction is used to load the low-byte or high-byte of a number into the accumulator, before adding it to the corresponding byte of the other number. Here is an example of adding two numbers NUM1 and NUM2 with the result being placed in SUM: CLC ;clear carry flag LDA NUM1LOW ;low half of NUM1 ADC NUM2LOW ;low half of NUM2 STA SUMLOW ;low half of result LDA NUM1HIGH ;high half of NUM1 ADC NUM2HIGH ;high half of NUM2 STA SUMHIGH ;high half of result."
