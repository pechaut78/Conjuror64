"What does the CMP instruction do in C64 assembly language?","The CMP instruction in C64 assembly language compares the contents of the accumulator with the contents of the addressed memory location by logically subtracting the contents of the operand from the accumulator. It sets the carry flag based on whether an underflow occurred and the zero, negative, and overflow flags based on the result of the calculation."
"How does the CMP instruction affect the carry flag?","The CMP instruction in C64 assembly language sets the carry flag based on whether an underflow occurred during the comparison of the contents of the accumulator and the addressed memory location. If an underflow occurs, the carry flag is cleared; otherwise it is set."
"How does the CMP instruction affect the zero flag?","The CMP instruction in C64 assembly language sets the zero flag based on the result of the comparison of the contents of the accumulator and the addressed memory location. If the result is zero, the zero flag is set; otherwise it is cleared."
"How does the CMP instruction affect the negative flag?","The CMP instruction in C64 assembly language sets the negative flag based on the result of the comparison of the contents of the accumulator and the addressed memory location. If the result is greater than $7F (127), the negative flag is set; otherwise it is cleared."
"What is an example of the CMP instruction in C64 assembly language?","An example of the CMP instruction in C64 assembly language is: LDA #$50 CMP #$30. In this example, the accumulator contains $50 and the calculation $50 - $30 is carried out, with a result of $20. Because no underflow occurred, the carry flag is set. The zero flag is cleared because the result is not equal to zero. The negative flag is cleared because the number is not greater than $7F."
"What is the result of the CMP instruction in the example provided?","The result of the CMP instruction in the example provided is: C=1; Z=0; N=0. This indicates that no underflow occurred (carry flag is set), the result is not equal to zero (zero flag is cleared), and the number is not greater than $7F (negative flag is cleared)."
"What is the purpose of the CMP instruction in C64 assembly language?","The purpose of the CMP instruction in C64 assembly language is to compare the contents of the accumulator with the contents of the addressed memory location and set the carry, zero, negative, and overflow flags based on the result of the comparison."
"What is the format of the CMP instruction in C64 assembly language?","The format of the CMP instruction in C64 assembly language is: CMP operand. The operand can be a memory location or a register."
"How does the CMP instruction differ from the SUB instruction in C64 assembly language?","The CMP instruction in C64 assembly language compares the contents of the accumulator with the contents of the addressed memory location and sets the flags based on the result, while the SUB instruction subtracts the contents of the addressed memory location from the accumulator and stores the result in the accumulator. The SUB instruction does not affect the flags."
"What is the effect of the CMP instruction on the accumulator in C64 assembly language?","The CMP instruction in C64 assembly language does not affect the accumulator. It only affects the flags based on the result of the comparison of the contents of the accumulator and the addressed memory location."
