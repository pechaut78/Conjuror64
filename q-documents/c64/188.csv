"What is the purpose of the IOBASE routine in the Commodore 64 KERNAL?","B-12. Function Name: IOBASE

    Purpose: Define I/O memory page
    Call address: $FFF3 (hex) 65523 (decimal)
    Communication registers: X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns:
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: X, Y


    Description: This routine sets the X and Y registers to the address of
  the memory section where the memory mapped 110 devices are located. This
  address can then be used with an offset to access the memory mapped I/O
  devices in the Commodore 64. The offset is the number of locations from
  the beginning of the page on which the I/O register you want is located.
  The X register contains the low order address byte, while the Y register
  contains the high order address byte.
    This routine exists to provide compatibility between the Commodore 64,
  VIC-20, and future models of the Commodore 64. If the J/0 locations for
  a machine language program are set by a call to this routine, they should
  still remain compatible with future versions of the Commodore 64, the
  KERNAL and BASIC.


  How to Use:

    1) Call this routine by using the JSR instruction.
    2) Store the X and the Y registers in consecutive locations.
    3) Load the Y register with the offset.
    4) Access that I/O location.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;SET THE DATA DIRECTION REGISTER OF THE USER PORT TO 0 (INPUT)
    JSR IOBASE
    STX POINT       ;SET BASE REGISTERS
    STY POINT+1
    LDY #2
    LDA #0          ;OFFSET FOR DDR OF THE USER PORT
    STA (POINT),Y   ;SET DDR TO 0"
