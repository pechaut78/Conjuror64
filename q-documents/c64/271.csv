"What are the 6526 interface signals?","6526 INTERFACE SIGNALS

  02-Clock Input

    The 02 clock is a TTL compatible input used for internal device opera-
  tion and as a timing reference for communicating with the system data
  bus.

  /CS-Chip Select Input

    The /CS input controls the activity of the 6526. A low level on /CS
  while 02 is high causes the device to respond to signals on the R/W and
  address (RS) lines. A high on /CS prevents these lines from controlling
  the 6526. The /CS line is normally activated (low) at 02 by the
  appropriate address combination.

  R/W-Read/Write Input

    The R/W signal is normally supplied by the microprocessor and controls
  the direction of data transfers of the 6526. A high on R/W indicates
  a read (data transfer out of the 6526), while a low indicates a write
  (data transfer into the 6526).

  RS3-RS0-Address Inputs

    The address inputs select the internal registers as described by the
  Register Map.

  DB7-DB0-Data Bus Inputs/Outputs

    The eight data bus pins transfer information between the 6526 and the
  system data bus. These pins are high impedance inputs unless CS is low
  and R/W and 02 are high to read the device. During this read, the data
  bus output buffers are enabled, driving the data from the selected
  register onto the system data bus.

  IRQ-Interrupt Request Output

    IRQ is an open drain output normally connected to the processor inter-
  rupt input. An external pullup resistor holds the signal high, allowing
  multiple IRQ outputs to be connected together. The IRQ output is normally
  off (high impedance) and is activated low as indicated in the functional
  description.

  /RES-Reset Input

    A low on the RES pin resets all internal registers. The port pins are
  set as inputs and port registers to zero (although a read of the ports
  will return all highs because of passive pullups). The timer control
  registers are set to zero and the timer latches to all ones. All other
  registers are reset to zero."
