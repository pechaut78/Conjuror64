"What are some essential tips and strategies for a beginner to learn and master machine language programming?","USEFUL TIPS FOR THE BEGINNER

    One of the best ways to learn machine language is to look at other
  peoples' machine language programs. These are published all the time in
  magazines and newsletters. Look at them even if the article is for a
  different computer, which also uses the 6510 (or 6502) microprocessor.
  You should make sure that you thoroughly understand the code that you
  look at. This will require perseveres I ce, especially when you see a new
  technique that you have never come across before. This can be infuriat-
  ing, but if patience prevails, you will be the victor.
    Having looked at other machine language programs, you MUST write your
  own. These may be utilities for your BASIC programs, or they may be an
  all machine language program.
    You should also use the utilities that are available, either IN your
  computer, or in a program, that aid you in writing, editing, or tracking
  down errors in a machine language program. An example would be the
  KERNAL, which allows you to check the keyboard, print text, control
  peripheral devices like disk drives, printers, modems, etc., manage
  memory and the screen. It is extremely powerful and it is advised
  strongly that it is used (refer to KERNAL section, Page 268).
    Advantages of writing programs in machine language:

    1. Speed - Machine language is hundreds, and in some cases thousands of
       times faster than a high level language such as BASIC.

    2. Tightness - A machine language program can be made totally
       'watertight,' i.e., the user can be made to do ONLY what the program
        allows, and no more. With a high level language, you are relying on
        the user not 'crashing' the BASIC interpreter by entering, for
        example, a zero which later causes a:


  ?DIVISION BY ZERO ERROR IN LINE 830

  READY.


  In essence, the computer can only be maximized by the machine language
  programmer."
