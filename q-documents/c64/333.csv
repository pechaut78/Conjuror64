"What are the primary functions of the D0-D7 pins in the SID and microprocessor?","D0-D7 (Pins 15-22)

    These bidirectional lines are used to transfer data between SID and the
  microprocessor. They are TTL compatible in the input mode and capable of
  driving 2 TTL loads in the output mode. The data buffers are usually in
  the high-impedance off state. During a Write operation, the data buffers
  remain in the off (input) state and the microprocessor supplies data to
  SID over these lines. During a Read operation, the data buffers turn on
  and SID supplies data to the microprocessor over these lines. The pins
  are normally connected to the corresponding data lines of the micro-
  processor.

  POTX,POTY (Pins 24,23)

    These pins are inputs to the A/D converters used to digitize the posi-
  tion of potentiometers. The conversion process is based on the time con-
  stant of a capacitor tied from the POT pin to ground, charged by a
  potentiometer tied from the POT pin to +5 volts. The component values are
  determined by:

                                RC = 4.7E-4

  Where R is the maximum resistance of the pot and C is the capacitor.
    The larger the capacitor, the smaller the POT value jitter. The recom-
  mended values for R and C are 470 komhs and 1000 pF. Note that a separate
  pot and cap are required for each POT pin."
