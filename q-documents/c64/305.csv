"What are the key differences in address output configurations between the 6566 and 6567 video interface chips?","MEMORY INTERFACE

    The two versions of the video interface chip, 6566 and 6567, differ in
  address output configurations. The 6566 has thirteen fully decoded
  addresses for direct connection to the system address bus. The 6567 has
  multiplexed addresses for direct connection to 64K dynamic RAMS. The
  least significant address bits, A06-A00, are present on A06-A00 while
  /RAS is brought low, while the most significant bits, A13-A08, are pres-
  ent on A05-A00 while /CAS is brought low. The pins A11-A07 on the 6567
  are static address outputs to allow direct connection of these bits to a
  conventional 16K (2K*8) ROM. (The lower order addresses require external
  latching.)"
