  CHIP SPECIFICATIONS
  CONCEPT

    The 6581 Sound Interface Device (SID) is a single-chip, 3-voice elec-
  tronic music synthesizer/sound effects generator compatible with the 65XX
  and similar microprocessor families. SID provides wide-range, high-
  resolution control of pitch (frequency), tone color (harmonic content),
  and dynamics (volume). Specialized control circuitry minimizes software
  overhead, facilitating use in arcade/home video games and low-cost
  musical instruments.
