"What is the primary way to access and modify the memory locations used for music synthesis in the Commodore 64?","Your Commodore computer is equipped with one of the most sophisticated
  electronic music synthesizers available on any computer. It comes
  complete with three voices, totally addressable, ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN/
  RELEASE (ADSR), filtering, modulation, and 'white noise.' All of these
  capabilities are directly available for you through a few easy to use
  BASIC and/or assembly language statements and functions. This means that
  you can make very complex sounds and songs using programs that are
  relatively simple to design.
    This section of your Programmer's Reference Guide has been created to
  help you explore all the capabilities of the 6581 'SID' chip, the sound
  and music synthesizer inside your Commodore computer. We'll explain both
  the theory behind musical ideas and the practical aspects of turning
  those ideas into real finished songs on your Commodore computer.
    You need not be an experienced programmer nor a music expert to achieve
  exciting results from the music synthesizer. This section is full of
  programming examples with complete explanations to get you started.
    You get to the sound generator by POKEing into specified memory
  locations. A full list of the locations used is provided in Appendix O.
  We will go through each concept, step by step. By the end you should be
  able to create an almost infinite variety of sounds, and be ready to
  perform experiments with sound on your own.
    Each section of this chapter begins by giving you an example and a full
  line-by-line description of each program, which will show you how to use
  the characteristic being discussed. The technical explanation is for you
  to read whenever you are curious about what is actually going on. The
  workhorse of your sound programs is the POKE statement. POKE sets the
  indicated memory location (MEM) equal to a specified value (NUM).
    POKE MEM,NUM
    The memory locations (MEM) used for music synthesis start at 54272
  ($D400) in the Commodore 64. The memory locations 54272 to 54296
  inclusive are the POKE locations you need to remember when you're using
  the 6581 (SID) chip register map. Another way to use the locations above
  is to remember only location 54272 and then add a number from 0 through
  24 to it. By doing this you can POKE all the locations from 54272 to
  54296 that you need from the SID chip. The numbers (NUM) that you use in
  your POKE statement must be between 0 and 255, inclusive.
    When you've had a little more practice with making music, then you can
  get a little more involved, by using the PEEK function. PEEK is a
  function that is equal to the value currently in the indicated memory
  location.
    X=PEEK(MEM)

    The value of the variable X is set equal to the current contents of
  memory location MEM.
    Of course, your programs include other BASIC commands, but for a full
  explanation of them, refer to the BASIC Statements section of this
  manual."
