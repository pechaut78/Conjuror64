"What information about the SID chip's parameters can be changed dynamically during a note or sound to create many interesting and fun effects?","SOUND  ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

    The SID chip's parameters can be changed dynamically during a note or
  sound to create many interesting and fun effects. In order to make this
  easy to do, digitized outputs from oscillator three and envelope
  generator three are available for you in registers 27 and 28, respec-
  tively.
    The output of oscillator 3 (register 27) is directly related to the
  waveform selected. If you choose the sawtooth waveform of oscillator 3,
  this register will present a series of numbers incremented (increased
  step by step) from 0 to 255 at a rate determined by the frequency of
  oscillator 3. If you choose the triangle waveform, the output will incre-
  ment from 0 up to 255, then decrement (decrease step by step) back down
  to 0. If you choose the pulse wave, the output will jump back-and-forth
  between 0 and 255. Finally, choosing the noise waveform will give you a
  series of random numbers. When oscillator 3 is used for modulation, you
  usually do NOT want to hear its output. Setting bit 7 of register 24
  turns the audio output of voice 3 off. Register 27 always reflects the
  changing output of the oscillator and is not affected in any way by the
  envelope (ADSR) generator.
    Register 25 gives you access to the output of the envelope generator
  of oscillator 3. It functions in much the same fashion that the output of
  oscillator 3 does. The oscillator must be turned on to produce any output
  from this register.
    Vibrato (a rapid variation in frequency) can be achieved by adding the
  output of oscillator 3 to the frequency of another oscillator. Example
  Program 6 illustrates this idea."
