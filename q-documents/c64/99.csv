"What is 64Mon?","64MON

    The 64MON cartridge available from your local dealer, is a program that
  allows you to escape from the world of CBM BASIC, into the land of
  machine language. It can display the contents of the internal registers
  in the 6510 microprocessor, and it allows you to display portions of mem-
  ory, and change them on the screen, using the screen editor. It also has
  a built-in assembler and disassembler, as well as many other features
  that allow you to write and edit machine language programs easily. You
  don't HAVE to use an assembler to write machine language, but the task is
  considerably easier with it. If you wish to write machine language
  programs, it is strongly suggested that you purchase an assembler of some
  sort. Without an assembler you will probably have to 'POKE' the machine
  language program into memory, which is totally unadvisable. This manual
  will give its examples in the format that 64MON uses, from now on. Nearly
  all assembler formats are the same, therefore the machine language
  examples shown will almost certainly be compatible with any assembler.
  But before explaining any of the other features of 64MON, the hexadecimal
  numbering system must be explained."
