"What types of filtering are available on the SID chip?","FILTERING

    The harmonic content of a waveform can be changed by using a filter.
  The SID chip is equipped with three types of filtering. They can be used
  separately or in combination with one another. Let's go back to the
  sample program you've been using to play with a simple example that uses
  a filter. There are several filter controls to set.
    You add line 15 in the program to set the cutoff frequency of the
  filter. The cutoff frequency is the reference point for the filter. You
  SET the high and low frequency cutoff points in registers 21 and 22. To
  turn ON the filter for voice 1, POKE register 23.
    Next change line 30 to show that a high-pass filter will be used (see
  the SID register map).


    The SID chip also has a low-pass filter. As its name implies, this
  filter will pass the frequencies below cutoff and attenuate those above.


    Finally, the chip is equipped with a bandpass filter, which passes a
  narrow band of frequencies around the cutoff, and attenuates all others.


    The high- and low-pass filters can be combined to form a notch reject
  filter which passes frequencies away from the cutoff while attenuating
  at the cutoff frequency.



    Register 24 determines which type filter you want to use. This is in
  addition to register 24's function as the overall volume control. Bit 6
  controls the high-pass filter (0 = off, 1 = on), bit 5 is the bandpass
  filter, and bit 4 is the low-pass filter. The low 3 bits of the cutoff
  frequency are determined by register 21 (Lcf) (Lcf = 0 through 7). While
  the 8 bits of the high cutoff frequency are determined by register 22
  (Hcf) (Hcf = 0 through 255).
    Through careful use of filtering, you can change the harmonic structure
  of any waveform to get just the sound you want. In addition, changing the
  filtering of a sound as it goes through the ADSR phases of its life can
  produce interesting effects."
