"What is the primary function of the OSC 3 register in a sid synthesizer?","OSC 3/RANDOM (Register $1B)

    This register allows the microprocessor to read the upper 8 output bits
  of Oscillator 3. The character of the numbers generated is directly re-
  lated to the waveform selected. If the Sawtooth waveform of Oscillator 3
  is selected, this register will present a series of numbers incrementing
  from 0 to 255 ($FF) at a rate determined by the frequency of Oscillator
  3. If the Triangle waveform is selected, the output will increment from 0
  up to 255, then decrement down to 0. If the Pulse waveform is selected,
  the output will jump between 0 and 255. Selecting the Noise waveform
  will produce a series of random numbers, therefore, this register can be
  used as a random number generator for games. There are numerous timing
  and sequencing applications for the OSC 3 register, however, the chief
  function is probably that of a modulation generator. The numbers
  generated by this register can be added, via software, to the Oscillator
  or Filter Frequency registers or the Pulse Width registers in real-time.
  Many dynamic effects can be generated in this manner. Siren-like sounds
  can be created by adding the OSC 3 Sawtooth output to the frequency
  control of another oscillator. Synthesizer 'Sample and Hold' effects can
  be produced by adding the OSC 3 Noise output to the Filter Frequency
  control registers. Vibrato can be produced by setting Oscillator 3 to a
  frequency around 7 Hz and adding the OSC 3 Triangle output (with proper
  scaling) to the Frequency control of another oscillator. An unlimited
  range of effects are available by altering the frequency of Oscillator 3
  and scaling the OSC 3 output. Normally, when Oscillator 3 is used for
  modulation, the audio output of Voice 3 should be eliminated (3 OFF = 1)."
