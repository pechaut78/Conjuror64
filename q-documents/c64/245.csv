"What is the purpose of the SERIAL ATN OUT signal in the Commodore 64?","SERIAL ATN OUT: (SERIAL ATTENTION OUT)

    The Commodore 64 uses this signal to start a command sequence for a
  device on the serial bus. When the Commodore 64 brings this signal LOW,
  all other devices on the bus start listening for the Commodore 64 to
  transmit an address. The device addressed must respond in a preset period
  of time; otherwise, the Commodore 64 will assume that the device
  addressed is not on the bus, and will return an error in the STATUS WORD."
