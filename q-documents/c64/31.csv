"how do I turn a sprite On ?","TURNING SPRITES ON

    The VIC-II control register at location 53269 ($D015 in HEX) is known
  as the SPRITE ENABLE register. Each of the sprites has a bit in this
  register which controls whether that sprite is ON or OFF. The register
  looks like this:

                     $D015  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

    To turn on sprite 1, for example, it is necessary to turn that bit to
  a 1. The following POKE does this:

    POKE 53269.PEEK(53269)OR 2

  A more general statement would be the following:

    POKE 53269,PEEK(53269)OR (2^SN)

  where SN is the sprite number, from 0 to 7.

   NOTE: A sprite must be turned ON before it can be seen."
