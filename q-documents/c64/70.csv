"What are some important considerations when setting sprite pointer settings in RAM memory?","DIFFERENT SPRITE POINTER SETTINGS:

    These sprite pointer settings are RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY.
    Caution: you can set your sprite pointers anywhere in RAM memory but if
  you set them too 'low' in memory a long BASIC program may overwrite your
  sprite data, or vice versa. To protect an especially LONG BASIC PROGRAM
  from overwriting sprite data, you may want to set the sprites at a higher
  area of memory (for example, 2040,192 for sprite 0 at locations 12288 to
  12350... 2041,193 at locations 12352 to 12414 for sprite 1 and so on...
  by adjusting the memory locations from which sprites get their 'data,'
  you can define as many as 64 different sprites plus a sizable BASIC
  program. To do this, define several sprite 'shapes' in your DATA
  statements and then redefine a particular sprite by changing the
  'pointer' so the sprite you are using is 'pointed' at different areas of
  memory containing different sprite picture data. See the 'Dancing Mouse'
  to see how this works. If you want two or more sprites to have THE SAME
  SHAPE (you can still change position and color of each sprite), use the
  same sprite pointer and memory location for the sprites you want to match
  (for example, you can point sprites 0 and 1 to the same location by using
  POKE 2040,192 and POKE 2041, 192)."
