"What is the SID CONTROL REGISTER (Register 04)?","CONTROL REGISTER (Register 04)

    This register contains eight control bits which select various options
  on Oscillator 1.
    GATE (Bit 0): The GATE bit controls the Envelope Generator for Voice 1.
  When this bit is set to a one, the Envelope Generator is Gated
  (triggered) and the ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN cycle is initiated. When the bit
  is reset to a zero, the RELEASE cycle begins. The Envelope Generator
  controls the amplitude of Oscillator I appearing at the audio output,
  therefore, the GATE bit must be set (along with suitable envelope pa-
  rameters) for the selected output of Oscillator 1 to be audible. A de-
  tailed discussion of the Envelope Generator can be found at the end of
  this Appendix.
    SYNC (Bit 1): The SYNC bit, when set to a one, synchronizes the
  fundamental frequency of Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of
  Oscillator 3, producing 'Hard Sync' effects.
    Varying the frequency of Oscillator 1 with respect to Oscillator 3 pro-
  duces a wide range of complex harmonic structures from Voice I at the
  frequency of Oscillator 3. In order for sync to occur, Oscillator 3 must
  be set to some frequency other than zero but preferably lower than the
  frequency of Oscillator 1. No other parameters of Voice 3 have any effect
  on sync.
    RING MOD (Bit 2): The RING MOD bit, when set to a one, replaces the
  Triangle waveform output of Oscillator 1 with a 'Ring Modulated'
  combination of Oscillators 1 and 3. Varying the frequency of Oscillator 1
  with respect to Oscillator 3 produces a wide range of non-harmonic
  overtone structures for creating bell or gong sounds and for special ef-
  fects. In order for ring modulation to be audible, the Triangle waveform
  of Oscillator 1 must be selected and Oscillator 3 must be set to some
  frequency other than zero. No other parameters of Voice 3 have any effect
  on ring modulation.
    TEST (Bit 3): The TEST bit, when set to a one, resets and locks Oscil-
  lator 1 at zero until the TEST bit is cleared. The Noise waveform output
  of Oscillator 1 is also reset and the Pulse waveform output is held at a
  DC level. Normally this bit is used for testing purposes, however, it can
  be used to synchronize Oscillator 1 to external events, allowing the
  generation of highly complex waveforms under real-time software control.
  (Bit 4): When set to a one, the Triangle waveform output of Oscillator
  1 is selected. The Triangle waveform is low in harmonics and has a
  mellow, flute-like quality.
    (Bit 5): When set to a one, the Sawtooth waveform output of Oscillator
  1 is selected. The Sawtooth waveform is rich in even and odd harmonics
  and has a bright, brassy quality.
    (Bit 6): When set to a one, the Pulse waveform output of Oscillator 1
  is selected. The harmonic content of this waveform can be adjusted by the
  Pulse Width registers, producing tone qualities ranging from a bright,
  hollow square wave to a nasal, reedy pulse. Sweeping the pulse width in
  real-time produces a dynamic 'phasing' effect which adds a sense of
  motion to the sound. Rapidly jumping between different pulse widths can
  produce interesting harmonic sequences.
    NOISE (Bit 7): When set to a one, the Noise output waveform of
  Oscillator 1 is selected. This output is a random signal which changes at
  the frequency of Oscillator 1. The sound quality can be varied from a low
  rumbling to hissing white noise via the Oscillator 1 Frequency registers.
  Noise is useful in creating explosions, gunshots, jet engines, wind, surf
  and other unpitched sounds, as well as snore drums and cymbals. Sweeping
  the oscillator frequency with Noise selected produces a dramatic rushing
  effect.
    One of the output waveforms must be selected for Oscillator 1 to be
  audible, however, it is NOT necessary to de-select waveforms to silence
  the output of Voice 1. The amplitude of Voice 1 at the final output is a
  function of the Envelope Generator only.

  | NOTE: The oscillator output waveforms are NOT additive. If more than  |
  | one output waveform is selected simultaneously, the result will be a  |
  | logical ANDing of the waveforms. Although this technique can be used  |
  | to generate additional waveforms beyond the four listed above, it must|
  | be used with care. If any other waveform is selected while Noise is   |
  | on, the Noise output can 'lock up ' If this occurs, the Noise output  |
  | will remain silent until reset by the TEST bit or by bringing RES     |
  | (pin 5) low.                                                          |
