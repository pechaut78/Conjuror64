"Can you talk about the zero page addressing mode?","ADDRESSING MODES

  ZERO PAGE

  Absolute addresses are expressed in terms of a high
  and a low order byte. The high order byte is often referred to as the
  page of memory. For example, the address $1637 is in page $16 (22), and
  $0277 is in page $02 (2). There is, however, a special mode of addressing
  known as zero page addressing and is, as the name implies, associated
  with the addressing of memory locations in page zero. These addresses,
  therefore, ALWAYS have a high order byte of zero. The zero page mode of
  addressing only expects one byte to describe the address, rather than two
  when using an absolute address. The zero page addressing mode tells the
  microprocessor to assume that the high order address is zero. Therefore
  zero page addressing can reference memory locations whose addresses are
  between $0000 and $00FF. This may not seem too important at the moment,
  but you'll need the principles of zero page addressing soon."
