"What determines the order in which sprites appear in a scene?","SPRITE DISPLAY PRIORITIES

    Sprites have the ability to cross each other's paths, as well as cross
  in front of, or behind other objects on the screen. This can give you a
  truly three dimensional effect for games.
    Sprite to sprite priority is fixed. That means that sprite 0 has the
  highest priority, sprite 1 has the next priority, and so on, until we get
  to sprite 7, which has the lowest priority. In other words, if sprite 1
  and sprite 6 are positioned so that they cross each other, sprite 1 will
  be in front of sprite 6.
    So when you're planning which sprites will appear to be in the fore-
  ground of the picture, they must be assigned lower sprite numbers than
  those sprites you want to put towards the back of the scene. Those
  sprites will be given higher sprite numbers,

NOTE: A 'window' effect is possible. If a sprite with higher priority 
has 'holes' in it (areas where the dots are not set to 1 and thus     
turned ON), the sprite with the lower priority will show through. This
also happens with sprite and background data."
