"What is the CP/M?","USING COMMODORE CP/M(R)

    The Commodore Z-80 cartridge let's you run programs designed for a Z-80
  microprocessor on your Commodore 64. The cartridge is provided with a
  diskette containing the Commodore CP/M(R) operating system.

  RUNNING COMMODORE CP/M(R)

    To run CP/M(R):

      1) LOAD the CP/M(R) program from your disk drive.
      2) Type RUN.
      3) Hit the <RETURN> key.
    At this point the 64K bytes of RAM in the Commodore 64 are accessible
  by the built-in 6510 central processor, OR 48K bytes of RAM are available
  for the Z-80 central processor. You can shift back and forth between
  these two processors, but you can NOT use them at the same time in a
  single program. This is possible because of your Commodore 64's
  sophisticated timing mechanism.
    Below is the memory address translation that is performed on the Z-80
  cartridge. You should notice that by adding 4096 bytes to the memory
  locations used in CP/M(R) $1000 (hex) you equal the memory addresses of
  the normal Commodore 64 operating system. The correspondence between Z-80
  and 6510 memory addresses is as follows:"
