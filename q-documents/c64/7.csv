"What is the correct POKE statement to move the screen to a new location?","The location of screen memory can be changed easily by a POKE to
  control register 53272 ($D018 HEX). However, this register is also used
  to control which character set is used, so be careful to avoid disturbing
  that part of the control register. The UPPER 4 bits control the location
  of screen memory. To move the screen, the following statement should be
  used:
  POKE53272,(PEEK(53272)AND15)OR A
  Where 'A' has one of the following values:
$0000
$0400
$0800
$0C00
$1000
$1400
$1800
$1C00
$2000
$2400

You must also tell the KERNAL'S screen editor where the screen is as
follows: POKE 648, page (where page = address/256, e.g., 1024/256= 4,
so POKE 648,4)."
