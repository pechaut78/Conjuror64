"What is the starting point for calculating the position of a sprite in a 24x21 dot area?","The position of a sprite is calculated from the TOP LEFT corner of the
  24 dot by 21 dot area that your sprite can be designed in. It does NOT
  matter how many or how few dots you use to make up a sprite. Even if only
  one dot is used as a sprite, and you happen to want it in the middle of
  the screen, you must still calculate the exact positioning by starting at
  the top left corner location."
