"What is the primary strategy for approaching a large task in machine language programming?","APPROACHING A LARGE TASK

    When approaching a large task in machine language, a certain amount of
  subconscious thought has usually taken place. You think about how certain
  processes are carried out in machine language. When the task is started,
  it is usually a good idea to write it out on paper. Use block diagrams of
  memory usage, functional modules of code required, and a program flow.
  Let's say that you wanted to write a roulette game in machine language.
  You could outline it something like this:

    o Display title
    o Ask if player requires instructions
    o YES - display them-Go to START
    o NO - Go to START
    o START Initialize everything
    o MAIN display roulette table
    o Take in bets
    o Spin wheel
    o Slow wheel to stop
    o Check bets with result
    o Inform player
    o Player any money left?
    o YES - Go to MAIN
    o NO - Inform user!, and go to START


    This is the main outline. As each module is approached, you can break
  it down further. If you look at a large indigestable problem as something
  that can be broken down into small enough pieces to be eaten, then you'll
  be able to approach something that seems impossible, and have it all fall
  into place.
    This process only improves with practice, so KEEP TRYING."
