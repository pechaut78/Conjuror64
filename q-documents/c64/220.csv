"What is the purpose and functionality of the MACHINE LANGUAGE MONITOR (64MON) program?","MACHINE LANGUAGE MONITOR (64MON):

    This program allows you to enter a program in either HEX or SYMBOLIC
  codes, and save the portion of memory the program is in. Advantages of
  this method include easier entry of the machine language routines,
  debugging aids, and a much faster means of saving and loading. The
  drawback to this method is that it generally requires the BASIC program
  to load the machine language routine from tape or disk when it is
  started. (For more details on 64MON see the machine language section.)

  EXAMPLE:

    The following is an example of a BASIC program using a machine language
  routine prepared by 64MON. The routine is stored on tape:

    10 IF FLAG=L THEN 20
    15 FLAG=1:LOAD'MACHINE LANGUAGE ROUTINE NAME',1,1
    20
    .
    .
    REST OF BASIC PROGRAM"
