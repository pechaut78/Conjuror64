"What is the size of a standard (HI-RES) sprite in terms of dots?","DEFINING A SPRITE

    Sprites are defined like programmable characters are defined. However,
  since the size of the sprite is larger, more bytes are needed. A sprite
  is 24 by 21 dots, or 504 dots. This works out to 63 bytes (504/8 bits)

    A way to view how a sprite is created is to take a look at the
  sprite definition block on the bit level. 

  In a standard (HI-RES) sprite, each bit set to I is displayed in that
  sprite's foreground color. Each bit set to 0 is transparent and will
  display whatever data is behind it. This is similar to a standard
  character.
    Multi-color sprites are similar to multi-color characters. Horizontal
  resolution is traded for extra color resolution. The resolution of the
  sprite becomes 12 horizontal dots by 21 vertical dots. Each dot in the
  sprite becomes twice as wide, but the number of colors displayable in the
  sprite is increased to 4."
