"Describe how to position a sprite","SPRITE POSlTlON

    Each sprite is positioned via its X and Y position register (see register
  map) with a resolution of 512 horizontal and 256 vertical positions. The
 position of a sprite is determined by the upper-left corner of the array. X
  locations 23 to 347 ($17-$157) and Y locations 50 to 249 ($32-$F9) are
  visible. Since not all available sprite positions are entirely visible on
  the screen, sprites may be moved smoothly on and off the display screen."
