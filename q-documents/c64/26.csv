"What are the key features of sprites in the VIC-II chip?","SPRITES

    A SPRITE is a special type of user definable character which can be
  displayed anywhere on the screen. Sprites are maintained directly by the
  VIC-II chip. And all you have to do is tell a sprite 'what to look like,'
  'what color to be,' and 'where to appear.' The VIC-II chip will do the
  rest! Sprites can be any of the 16 colors available.
    Sprites can be used with ANY of the other graphics modes, bit mapped,
  character, multi-color, etc., and they'll keep their shape in all of
  them. The sprite carries its own color definition, its own mode (HI-RES
  or multi-colored), and its own shape.
    Up to 8 sprites at a time can be maintained by the VIC-II chip auto-
  matically. More sprites can be displayed using RASTER INTERRUPT
  techniques.

    The features of SPRITES include:

    1) 24 horizontal dot by 21 vertical dot size.
    2) Individual color control for each sprite.
    3) Sprite multi-color mode.
    4) Magnification (2x) in horizontal, vertical, or both directions.
    5) Selectable sprite to background priority.
    6) Fixed sprite to sprite priorities.
    7) Sprite to sprite collision detection.
    8) Sprite to background collision detection."
