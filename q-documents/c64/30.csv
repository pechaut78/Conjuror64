"What is the formula for calculating the start of the 64 bytes of the sprite definition block?","If sprite pointer #0, at location 2040, contains the number 14, for
  example, this means that sprite 0 will be displayed using the 64 bytes
  beginning at location 14*64 = 896 which is in the cassette buffer. The
  following formula makes this clear:

    LOCATION = (BANK * 16384) + (SPRITE POINTER VALUE * 64)

  Where BANK is the 16K segment of memory that the VIC-II chip is looking
  at and is from 0 to 3.
    The above formula gives the start of the 64 bytes of the sprite
  definition block.
    When the VIC-II chip is looking at BANK 0 or BANK 2, there is a ROM
  IMAGE of the character set present in certain locations, as mentioned
  before. Sprite definitions can NOT be placed there. If for some reason
  you need more than 128 different sprite definitions, you should use one
  of the banks without the ROM IMAGE, 1 or 3."
