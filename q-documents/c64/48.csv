"How do you control sprite to background priority?","Sprite to background priority is controllable by the SPRITE-BACK-GROUND priority register located at 53275 ($D01B).
  Each sprite has a bit in this register. If that bit is 0, that sprite has a higher priority
  than the background on the screen. In other words, the sprite appears in
  front of background data. If that bit is a 1, that sprite has a lower
  priority than the background. Then the sprite appears behind the back-
  ground data."
