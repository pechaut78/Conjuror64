"What are some important tips for the proper care and use of a computer mouse?","Mouse Tips

Proper care and use of your mouse requires common sense.

Use your mouse on a clean, smooth surface.

Make  sure  you  have  adequate  desktop space to manipulate your
mouse, so you don't have to constantly pick up and reposition it.

Don't  hold  the mouse by its cord,  or let the body of the mouse
hang off the table."
