question,answer
"How does the mouse operate in joystick mode?","In joystick mode the mouse operates as follows:
1) If the mouse is moved, then the appropriate joystick lines are
   activated for a period of 20 ms. Thus moving the mouse is like
   pushing the joystick in the appropriate direction.
2) The  left  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be the fire
   button on a joystick.
3) The  right  mouse button is mapped into the SID POTX register.
   If  the  button  is depressed  then the SID POTX register will
   contain a number <$80. If the button is not depressed then SID
   POTX will contain a number >=$80.
4) See the section on SID Register Cautions.

Software Interface

For  most  applications,  the  interface for joystick mode should
be  just  as  any joystick driver, and the right button should be
ignored."
