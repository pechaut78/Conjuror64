"What are the features and modes of operation of the Commodore 1351 Mouse(TM)?","The  Commodore  1351  Mouse(TM)  is a controller designed for use
with  the  Commodore 64(R)  or  Commodore 128(TM)  computers.  It
features two buttons on the top, and a ball on the underside that
is rolled upon a flat surface to manipulate onscreen activity.

The  mouse  has  two  modes  of  operation  --  joystick mode and
proportional mode.

In  joystick  mode,  the  mouse  emulates  a  joystick and can be
used  with all joystick-compatible  software.  In this mode,  the
left  button  is  the fire button and the right button is usually
ignored.

In   proportional  mode,  the  mouse  uses  a  new  technique  to
communicate   mouse   movement  to  the  controlling  application
software.  That requires  the software to know the mouse is there
and  how to read it.  For example,  the GEOS(TM) operating system
can  use  many  different  input  drivers.  One  of  them  is the
Commodore  Mouse  driver,  which  can  be  used  with the 1351 in
proportional mode.

The  1351  provides a proportional mode  so that applications can
have a fast,  responsive pointer that moves easily on the screen.
Joystick mode acts as a fallback for those for those applications
that don't have installable device drivers. You can therefore use
the mouse as a joystick for older software, and take advantage of
the   benefits   provided   by   proportional   mode  with  newer
applications.

The mouse automatically powers up in proportional mode. To choose
joystick mode,  plug  the  mouse into either joystick port on the
side  of  the  computer  and  hold  down the right button  as the
computer is powered up."
