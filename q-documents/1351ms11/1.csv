"What are the steps to clean a computer mouse?","Mouse Cleaning

Since the ball of your mouse roll freely to accurately manipulate
the cursor  (or whatever) on the screen,  it's important that the
ball remains free of dirt or debris.  This is easily accomplished
by sliding out the plastic piece holding the ball in place.


Remove  the  ball  and  wipe  it off with a soft cloth, such as a
handkerchief.


To remove any dirt or dust  from the ball area,  just blow gently
into the opening.  Around the top of the opening, there are three
metal rollers. To clean these, take cotton-tipped swab, moistened
with head cleaning fluid or alcohol, and gently clean the surface
of each roller.  Replace the ball inside the controller  and snap
the plastic piece back on."
