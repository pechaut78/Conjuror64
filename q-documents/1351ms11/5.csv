"What is the operational mode of a mouse that tracks movement internally and transmits position data to the SID POTX and POTY registers every 512 microseconds without requiring software intervention?","Proportional Mode

In proportional mode the mouse operates as follows:
1) Mouse  movement  is  tracked internally within the mouse.  The
   position of the mouse MOD 64  is  transmitted to the SID  POTX
   and  POTY  registers  every  512  microsecond  and requires no
   software intervention.
   The  POTX  register  is  used  to read X position of the mouse
   and the POTY register is used to read Y position of the mouse.
   The register contents are as follows:

                    +-------------------------------+
   Bit Position     | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
                    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   POT Register     | X | P5| P4| P3| P2| P1| P0| N |
                    +-------------------------------+
   where:
        X ......... is a don't care bit.
        P5-P0 ..... is the mouse position MOD 64.
        N ......... is a special (noise) bit (keep reading...).

2) The  left  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be the fire
   button on a joystick.
3) The  right  mouse  button  is  mapped to what would be that UP
   direction on a joystick.

Software Interface

1) Because  the  left and right buttons appear as joystick lines,
   reading  them  from  software is a simple exercise in polling.
   Note that as with a joystick,  the buttons will interfere with
   the  keyboard  map,  and  software  should make some effort to
   distinguish between point short in the keyboard matrix  (i.e.,
   a  key  being  depressed),  and  a  whole  row or column being
   grounded (i.e., a joystick type of signal).
2) The  position information is not difficult to handle.  Ideally
   is  should be installed as part of the 60 Hz interrupt routine
   (preferably  at  the  beginning  --  see  the  section  on SID
   Register Cautions).
   This strategy is as follows:
   1) Read the mouse position MOD 64.
   2) Determine  if  the mouse has moved by comparing the current
      position with a saved copy of the previous position.
   3) If  the mouse has moved,  then modify your pointer position
      appropriately.
      You  should  note,  that even if the mouse is still,  it is
      possible for the POT register  to oscillate between $80 and
      $7F.  This  would result in the mouse position as jittering
      between two points.

In  order  to  ascertain  whether  the mouse has moved the software
should read the low order bit of the POT register.

All of this can be seen in the supplied mouse driver code."
