"What are some important considerations and guidelines for formatting and using a Commodore hard disk drive?","Hard Disk Formatting
If you have any plans to install a Commodore hard disk drive, chances are the first command you send to it will be a New or HEADER operation. Disk users will know that this formating procedure is necessary to prepare the unit for all future operations. But once you get it started, you might as well find something else to do for a while like learn to play piano or re-build the engine in your car. A Header opera tion on the hard disk can take as long as 1 hour 45 minutes because the ID you select is recorded on every sector header.
You need only do this once unless you wish to change the ID. A Header without the ID merely clears the BAM (Block Allocation Map) and the directory - the rest of the disk is left untouched. If you do decide a re-format is necessary, just remember it will take a while.
Two other hard disk notes: The unit should never be moved while the cylinder is spinning. It takes a minute or so for the cylinder to come to a complete stop after power-down. When moving it, keep the unit level - don't set it on end or its side. Hard disks should be kept on a good solid surface during operation. Even small vibrations can cause undue wear on the disk bearings. Avoid sheifs, tables with long legs or spots that may get bumped by passers-by.
Lastly, Commodore hard disks don't have a drive 0 and drive 1 - only drive 0. Some software packages assume you have a dual floppy and will attempt to access drive 1. Even BASIC tries to read drive 1 when you give a Catalog or Directory command with no drive specified. If you're experi encing any trouble, just slip in a ',D0' or '0:'."
