"What are some handy methods and user-defined functions for working with inverse trigonometric functions and trigonometric functions in degrees?","INVERSE TRIGNOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
Here are a couple of handy methods of obtaining are sine and arc
cosine (remember, the result will be in radians).
ASNX = ATN (X/SQR(1-Xf2)
ACSX = ATN (SQR(1-Xf2)/X)
For those of you who are used to working in degrees, here are some
handy user defined functions:
DEFFNS(V) = SIN(V/(18O/tf))
DEFFNC(V) = COS(V/(180/rf))
DEFFNT(V) = TAN(V/(18O/rf))
These are three user defined functions which when called with
arguments and degrees will give the appropriate results. In these
examples V can be any variable but if all three are defined in
the same programme, you must use three different dummy variables.
EXAMPLE: PRINT FNS(3O)
Result of this will be .5. Notice that the argument for FNS, or
FN anything for that matter, can be either a variable or numeric
constant. Also, after a programme containing these definitions
has been run, these functions may be called using FN in the direct
mode, that is, from the keyboard directly without being in a
programme."
