"What are some advanced Commodore 64 hardware tips and modifications for service technicians and enthusiasts?","Some More C64 Hardware Tips
Tony Lamartina of Chicago has another, but it's more suited to service technicians or those with access to necessary equipment.
1. Remove metal cover from video RF area.
2. Connect scope lead between ground and pin 1 of IC31. 3. Adjust R27 for 1.5 volt DC level.
4. Connect scope lead between ground and pin 4 of DIN
plug.
5. Adjust R25 for midposition
6. Connect decade box between pin 4 of DIN plug and
right side of C78
7. Adjust resistance of decade box for 0.8 to 1 volt of
signal level on scope
8. Connect resistor of value determined by decade box
across pin 1 and pin 4 of DIN plug
9. Fine adjust R25 for best display of colour monitor.
Tony also suggests the following be checked on early re leases of the 64:
1. Loose RF box covers. Tighten the metal tabs and re-in stall.
2. Check for a missing heat sink on VR2-7805 voltage regulator. Install suitable heat sink.
3. If the unit displays 'sparkling' (interference across the CRT screen, random in nature) connect a 330 picoF capacitor from pin 20 (ground) to pin 30 (address 6) of the 6567 (VIC II) video chip. Make this connection outside the RF shielded box."
