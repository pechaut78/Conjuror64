. Always turn the set off if it is necessary to leave the room for
more than a short period of time.  Never leave a set on when leaving
the house.  A possible malfunction may result in a fire hazard.

. Caution children about dropping or pushing objects into the set's
cabinet openings.  Some internal parts carry hazardous voltages and
contact can result in a fire or electrical shock.

. Unplug the set from the wall outlet before cleaning the face of
the picture tube.  Use a slightly damp (not wet) cloth.  Do not use an
aerosol directly on the picture tube since it may overspray and cause
electrical shock.

. Never add accessories to a set that has not been designed for this
purpose.  Such additions may result in a shock hazard.

. For added protection of the set during a lightning storm or when
the set is to be left unattended for an extended period of time,
unplug it from the wall outlet.  This will prevent possible shock and
fire hazards due to lightning storms or power line surges.

. Do not bring magnetic devices such as magnets or motors near the
picture tube.  These things have a bad effect on the color purity of
the picture.

. Sometimes you may feel static electricity when you touch the
surface of the picture tube.  However, this is normal for any TV set
and is harmless to the human body."
