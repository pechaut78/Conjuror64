"What are the safety precautions and guidelines for the installation and operation of a <1702 monitor?","1702 monitor INSTALLATION

1. Your set is equipped with a polarized AC line plug (one blade of
the plug is wider than the other).

This safety feature allows the plug to fit into the power outlet only
one way.  Should you be unable to insert the plug fully into the
outlet, try reversing the plug.  Should it still fail to fit, contact
your electrician.

2. Operate the set only from a power source as indicated on the set or
refer to the user's manual for this information.  If you are not sure
of the type of power supply to your home, consult your dealer or local
power company.

3. Overloaded AC outlets and extension cords are dangerous, and so are
frayed power cords and broken plugs.  They may result in a shock or
fire hazard.  Call your service technician for replacement.

4. Do not allow anything to rest or roll over the power cord, and do
not place the set where power cord is subject to traffic or abuse.
This may result in a shock or fire hazard.

5. Do not use this set near water -- for example, near a bathtub,
washbowl, kitchen sink, or laundry tub, in a wet basement, or near a
swimming pool, etc.

6. Sets are provided with ventilation openings in the cabinet to allow
heat generated during operation to be released.  If these openings are
blocked, heat built up within the set can cause failures which may
result in a fire hazard.  Therefore:

* Never block the bottom ventilation slots by placing it on a bed,
sofa, rug, etc.;
* Never place a set in a 'built-in' enclosure unless proper
ventilation is provided;
* Never cover the openings with cloth or other material;
* Never place the set near or over a radiator or heat register."
