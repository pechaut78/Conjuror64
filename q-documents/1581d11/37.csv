"What is the syntax and usage of the SCRATCH command in a disk with basic 7,0?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: FORMAT FOR THE SCRATCH COMMAND:

  SCRATCH 'pattern'[,Ddrive#][,Udevice#]

where  'pattern'  is  any  valid  file  name  or pattern-matching
character.

  You will be asked as a precaution:

  ARE YOU SURE?_

If you ARE sure, simply press Y and RETURN.  If not, press RETURN
alone or type any other answer, and the command will be canceled.
  The  number  of files that were scratched will be automatically
displayed.  For example,  if your diskette contains program files
named 'TEST',  'TRAIN',  'TRUCK', and 'TAIL', you may SCRATCH all
four,  along  with any other files beginning with the letter 'T',
by using the command:

  SCRATCH 'T*'

and  if  the  four listed were the only files beginning with 'T',
you will see:

  01, FILES SCRATCHED,04,00
  READY
  _

The '04' tells you 4 files were scratched.

  You can perform a  SCRATCH within a program,  but there will be
no prompt message displayed."
