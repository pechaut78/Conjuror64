"What is the purpose and functionality of the Track Cache Buffer in the 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk:  TRACK CACHE BUFFER

  One  of  the  improvements  in  the  1581  design over previous
Commodore  disk  drives  which makes the device more efficient is
the Track Cache buffer. This buffer is located from $0C00 through
$1FFF.  All  disk  accesses involve an entire physical track at a
time.  If  a single sector is needed from a particular track, the
entire  track is read into RAM.  Consequently,  any more requests
for sectors from the same track require only a RAM data transfer,
rather  than  a  search  of  the  track on the disk again. Sector
writes  are also speeded up considerably,  since each consecutive
write  to  sectors  on  the same track requires only a RAM to RAM
data transfer. After data is written into the Track Cache Buffer,
it  is not written to the disk until one of the following occurs:
1) a request is made for access of a sector on a different track,
2) a  'dump  track  buffer'  command is issued,  or  3) after 250
milliseconds of no serial bus activity."
