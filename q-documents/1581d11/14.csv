"What is the purpose and syntax of the VERIFY command ?","1581 disk:  VERIFY

  The  VERIFY  command can be used to make certain that a program
file  was  properly  saved  to disk.  It works much like the LOAD
command,  except  that  it  only  compares  each character in the
program  against  the  equivalent  character  in  the  computer's
memory, instead of actually being copied into memory.
  If  the  disk  copy of the program differs even a tiny bit from
the copy in memory, 'VERIFY ERROR' will be displayed, to tell you
that the copies differ. This doesn't mean either copy is bad, but
if they were supposed to be identical, there is a problem.
  Naturally,  there's no point in trying to VERIFY a disk copy of
a program after the original is no longer in memory. With nothing
to compare to,  an apparent error will always be announced,  even
though  the  disk copy is automatically verified as it is written
to the diskette."
