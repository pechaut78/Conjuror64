"What are the different ways to open a sequential file in BASIC 7.0 and BASIC 2.0, and how can you read and write to these files?","1581 disk with basic 7,0:EXAMPLES OF OPENING SEQUENTIAL FILES:

  To create a sequential file of phone numbers, you could use:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#2,'PHONES',D0,U8,W
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 2,8,2,'0:PHONES,SEQUENTIAL,WRITE'
              or
              OPEN 2,8,2,'0:PHONES,S,W'

  On  the  chance  you've  already  got  a  'PHONES'  file on our
diskette, you can avoid a 'FILE EXISTS' error message by doing an
@OPEN:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#2,'@PHONES',D0,U8,W
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 2,8,2,'@0:PHONES,S,W'

This  erases  all  your old phone numbers,  so make sure that any
information  that  may  be  deleted  is  of  no importance. After
writing  our  phone  file,  remove  the diskette and turn off the
system.  To recall the data in the file, reopen it with something
like:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#8,'PHONES',D0,U8
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 8,8,8,'0:PHONES,S,R'

It doesn't matter  whether the file and channel numbers match the
ones we used before,  but the file name does have to match.  It's
possible  to  use an abbreviation form of the file name, if there
are no other files that would have the same abbreviation:

  BASIC 7.0:  DOPEN#10,'PH*',D0,U8
  BASIC 2.0:  OPEN 10,8,6,'0:PH*,S,R'

  If you have too many phone numbers,  they  might not fit in one
file.  In  that  case,  use  several similar file names and let a
program choose the correct file.

  BASIC 7.0:  100 INPUT'WHICH PHONE NUMBERS FILE (1-3)';PH
              110 IF PH<>1 AND PH<>2 AND PH<>3 THEN 100
              120 DOPEN#4,'PHONE'+STR$(PH),D0,U8

  BASIC 2.0:  100 INPUT'WHICH PHONE NUMBERS FILE (1-3)';PH
              110 IF PH<>1 AND PH<>2 AND PH<>3 THEN 100
              120 OPEN 4,8,2,'PHONE'+STR$(PH)+',S,R'

You can omit the drive number on an OPEN command  to read a file.
Doing  so  allows those with dual drives to search both diskettes
for the file."
