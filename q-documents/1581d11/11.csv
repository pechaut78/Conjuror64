"What is the syntax and limitations of the SAVE command in Commodore computers?","1581 disk:  To reset drive, type: OPEN 15,8,15,'UJ':CLOSE 15.


1581 disk:  SAVE

  The  SAVE  command  preserves  a program or file on a formatted
diskette for latter use.

FORMAT FOR THE SAVE COMMAND:

  SAVE 'drive#:file name',device#

where   'file  name'  is  any  string  expression  of  up  to  16
characters,  preceded  by  the  drive  number  and  a  colon, and
followed by the device number of the disk, normally 8.
  However,  the  SAVE  command  will not work in copying programs
that  are  not in the BASIC text area,  such as 'DOS 5.1' for the
C64.  To copy it and similar machine-language programs,  you will
need a machine-language monitor program, such as the one resident
in the C128."
