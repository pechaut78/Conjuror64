"What are the special pattern-matching characters used to load a program from a partial name or to provide selective directories, and how do they work?","1581 disk: PATTERN MATCHING

  You  can  use  special  pattern-matching  characters  to load a
program   from  a  partial  name  or  to  provide  the  selective
directories described earlier.
  The  two  characters  used in pattern matching are the asterisk
(*)  and  the question mark  (?).  They act something like a wild
card in a game of cards.  The difference between the two  is that
the  asterisk  makes  all  characters in  and beyond its position
wild,  while  the question mark makes only its own position wild.
Here are some examples and their results:

  LOAD'A*',8  loads the first file on disk that begins with an A,
  regardless of what follows

  DLOAD'SM?TH'  loads  the  first  file that starts with SM, ends
  with TH, and one other character between

  DIRECTORY'Q*'  loads  a  directory  of  files whose names begin
  with Q

  LOAD'*',8  is a special case. When an asterisk is used alone as
  a name,  it matches the last file used  (on the C64 and C128 in
  C64 mode).

  LOAD '0:*',8 loads the first file on the diskette (C64 and C128
  in C64 mode).

  DLOAD'*'  loads the first file on the diskette (Plus/4 and C128
  in C128 mode)."
