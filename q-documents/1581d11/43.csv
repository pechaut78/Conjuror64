"What is the purpose of the COLLECT command in BASIC 7.0?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: COLLECT

  The  COLLECT  command  recalculates  the Block Availability Map
(BAM)  of  the  current  diskette,  allocating only those sectors
still  being  used by valid,  properly closed files and programs.
All other sectors  (blocks) are left unallocated and free for re-
use, and all improperly closed files are automatically scratched.
However,  this  brief  description  of  COLLECT  doesn't indicate
either  the  power or the danger of the command.  Its power is in
restoring  to  good  health  many  diskettes whose directories or
Block Availability Maps have become muddled.  Any time the blocks
used  by  the  files  on a diskette plus the blocks shown as free
don't  add  up to the 3160 available on a fresh diskette, COLLECT
is  needed  (with  one  exception below).  Similarly,  any time a
diskette   contains  an  improperly  closed  file  (splat  file),
indicated  by  an  asterisk  (*)  next  to  its  file type in the
directory, that diskette needs to be collected.  In fact, but for
the one exception below,  it  is a good idea to COLLECT diskettes
whenever  you are concerned about their integrity.  Just note the
number  of  blocks  free  in  the diskette's directory before and
after  using  COLLECT.  If the totals differ,  there was indeed a
problem,  and the diskette should probably be copied onto a fresh
diskette  file-by-file,  using  a  copy  program described in the
previous section, rather than using backup program.
  The  exception  is diskettes containing direct access files, as
described in Chapter 6.  Most direct access (random) files do not
allocate  their  sectors  in a way COLLECT command can recognize.
Thus,  collecting  such a diskette may result in unallocating all
direct access files,  with  loss of all their contents when other
files are added.  Unless specifically instructed otherwise, never
COLLECT  a  diskette containing direct access files. (Note: these
are  not  the  same as the relative files described in Chapter 5.
COLLECT may be used on relative files without difficulty.)
