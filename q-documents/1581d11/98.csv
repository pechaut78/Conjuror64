"What are the key features and considerations of the Burst Command Instruction Set (BCIS) for the 1581 disk?","1581 disk:  BURST COMMANDS


  The  Burst  Command  Instruction  Set  (BCIS)  is  a  series of
powerful,  versatile,  and complex commands that enables the user
to format,  read,  and write in numerous formats.  Burst commands
are sent via kernal calls, but the handshaking of data is done by
the user for maximum performance. There is no parameter checking,
so exercise care  when using the BCIS.  For instance,  if a burst
read  with an illegal track address is sent to a 1581,  the drive
will keep trying to find the invalid track.  Reading  and writing
in other formats is automatic if the commands are given in proper
sequence. Please become thoroughly familiar with all the commands
and follow the examples given in this chapter.  It's important to
follow the handshake conventions exactly for maximum performance.
  With the exception of  READ  and  WRITE,  burst commands do not
translate  from  logical to physical track and sector.  All track
and  sector  parameters  refer to physical locations (see Chapter
10).  Burst  sector  READ  and  WRITE  commands provide a flag to
enable logical to physical translation.  If the flag is set,  the
drive  does  the  translation  and  the default logical number of
bytes  per  sector  (256)  is transferred instead of the physical
number of bytes per sector (512)."
