"What are "splat files" and how should they be handled on a diskette?","SPLAT FILES

  One  indicator you may occasionally notice on a directory line,
after  you  begin  saving  programs  and  files,  is  an asterisk
appearing  just  before  the file type of a file that is 0 blocks
long.  This  indicates  the file was not properly closed after it
was created, and that it should not be relied upon. These 'splat'
files normally need to be erased from the diskette and rewritten.
However,  do not use the SCRATCH command to get rid of them. They
can  only  be  safely erased by the VALIDATE or COLLECT commands.
One  of  these  should  normally be used whenever a splat file is
noticed on a diskette. All of these commands are described in the
following chapters.
  There  are  two  exceptions  to the above warning:  one is that
VALIDATE  and  COLLECT  cannot  be  used  on  some diskettes that
include direct access  (random) files  (Chapter 6).  The other is
that  if  the information in the splat file was crucial and can't
be  replaced,  there is a way to rescue whatever part of the file
was  properly  written.  This  option  is  described  in the next
chapter."
