"What is the recommended approach when opening a relative file for the first time to ensure reliable usage and avoid potential issues?","USING RELATIVE FILES: RECORD# COMMAND

  When  a  relative file is opened for the first time,  it is not
quite ready for use. Both to save time when using the file later,
and to assure  that the file will work reliably,  it is necessary
to  create  several records before closing the file for the first
time.  At  a  minimum,  enough records to fill more than two disk
sectors (512 bytes) should be written. In practice, most programs
go ahead  and create as many records as the program is eventually
expected  to  use.  That  approach  has the additional benefit of
avoiding  such  problems  as  running out of room on the diskette
before the entire file is completed.
  If  you  simply  begin  writing  data to a just-opened relative
file,  it will act much like a sequential file,  putting the data
elements  written  by  the  first  PRINT# statement in record #1,
those  written by the second PRINT# statement in record #2 and so
on.  This  means  each  record must be written by a single PRINT#
statement,  using  embedded  carriage  returns within the data to
separate  fields  that  will  be  read  in via one or more INPUT#
statements later. However, it is far better to explicitly specify
which record number is desired via a RECORD# command to the disk.
This  allows  you to access records in any desired order, hopping
anywhere in a file with equal ease."
