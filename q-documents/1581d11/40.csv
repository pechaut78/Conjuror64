"How do you erase a locked file on a diskette that cannot be deleted with the SCRATCH command?","1581 disk with basic 7,0:  Locked Files

  Occasionally,  a diskette will contain a locked file; one which
cannot  be  erased  with  the  SCRATCH command. Such files may be
recognized  by  the  '<'  character which immediately follows the
file type in their directory entry. If you wish to erase a locked
file,  you  will have to use a disk monitor to clear bit 6 of the
file-type   byte   in   the  directory  entry  on  the  diskette.
Conversely, to lock a file, you would set bit 6 of the same byte."
