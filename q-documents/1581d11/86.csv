"How does a file-handling program using random files keep track of which blocks on the disk have been used?","1581 disk:  USING RANDOM FILES

  By combining the commands in this chapter,  it  is  possible to
develop a file-handling program that uses random files.  What you
need to know now is how to keep track of which blocks on the disk
such a file has used. (Even though you know a sector has not been
allocated by your random file,  you  must  also be sure it wasn't
allocated by another unrelated file on the diskette.)
  The  most  common way of recording which sectors have been used
by  a  random  file is in a sequential file.  The sequential file
stores a list of record numbers, with the track, sector, and byte
location of each record.  This means three channels are needed by
a random file:  one  for the command channel,  one for the random
data, and the last for the sequential data."
