"What is the purpose of the VERIFY command in Commodore computers?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: VERIFY

  This  command  makes  a  byte-by-byte comparison of the program
currently   in   memory  against  a  program  on  diskette.  This
comparison includes the BASIC line links,  which may be different
for different types of memory configurations.  What this means is
that  a  program  saved to disk on a C64 and reloaded into a C128
wouldn't   verify  properly  because  the  line  links  point  to
different  memory  locations.  If  the  disk  copy of the program
differs at all from the copy in memory,  a 'VERIFY ERROR' will be
displayed. This doesn't mean either copy is bad, but if they were
supposed to be identical, there is a problem."
