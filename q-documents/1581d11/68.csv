"What is the special character used by DOS to fill relative records as they are created, and how is it used when writing the last record in a relative file?","1581 disk:COMPLETING RELATIVE FILE CREATION

  Now that you have learned how to use both the  OPEN and RECORD#
commands,  you  are  almost  ready  to properly create a relative
file. The only additional fact you need to know is that CHR$(255)
is  a  special character in a relative file.  It is the character
used  by  the  DOS  to fill relative records as they are created,
before a program fills them with other information.  Thus, if you
want  to  write the last record,  you expect to need in your file
with  dummy  data  that  will not interfere with your later work,
CHR$(255)  is  the  obvious  choice."
