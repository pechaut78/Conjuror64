"How do you change the device number of a 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk: CHANGING THE DEVICE NUMBER

  Two  switches  on the back of the 1581 enable you to change the
device#  of  the drive.  You can use a screwdriver,  pen,  or any
other  small tool to set the switches.  The following table shows
the settings required for each device number:

            +------------+------------+-------------+
            |    Left    |    Right   |   Device#   |
            +------------+------------+-------------+
            |     UP     |     UP     |      8      |
            |    DOWN    |     UP     |      9      |
            |     UP     |    DOWN    |      10     |
            |    DOWN    |    DOWN    |      11     |
            +------------+------------+-------------+

  Another  way  to temporarily change the device number of a disk
drive is via a program.  When power is first turned on, the drive
reads  an  I/O  location  whose  value  is  controlled by the two
switches  on  its circuit board,  and writes the device number it
reads  there  into  memory  locations  119  and  120.   Any  time
thereafter, you may write over that device number with a new one,
which will be effective until it is changed again, or the 1581 is
reset."
