"What is the format for opening a direct access file on a 1581 disk, and how do you specify the memory buffer to use?","1581 disk:  OPENING A DATA CHANNEL FOR DIRECT ACCESS

  When  working  with  direct access data,  you need two channels
open to the disk:  the  command channel we've used throughout the
book,  and  another for data.  The command channel is opened with
the  usual  OPEN 15,8,15  or  equivalent.  A  direct  access data
channel  is  opened  much like other files,  except that the hash
sign (#),  optionally followed by a memory buffer number, is used
as a file name.

FORMAT FOR DIRECT ACCESS FILE OPEN STATEMENTS:

  OPEN file#,device#,channel#,'#buffer#'

where 'file#' is the file number,  'device#' is the disk's device
number,  normally  8;  'channel#' is the channel number, a number
between  2 and 14  not used by other files open at the same time;
and  'buffer#',  if present,  is a 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  or  6,
specifying  the  memory  buffer  within  the 1581 to use for this
file's data.

EXAMPLES:

To specify which disk buffer to use:

  OPEN 4,8,4,'#2'

If  you  don't  specify  which to use  (OPEN 5,8,5,'#'), the 1581
selects one."
