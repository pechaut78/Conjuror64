"What is the purpose of the SAVE WITH REPLACE command in a disk drive?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: SAVE WITH REPLACE

  If a file already exists, it can't be saved again with the same
name  because  the  disk  drive allows only one copy of any given
file name per diskette. It is possible to get around this problem
using the  RENAME  and  SCRATCH  commands described later in this
chapter.  If all you wish to do is replace a program or data file
with a revised version, another command is more convenient. Known
as SAVE-WITH-REPLACE, or @SAVE.  This option tells the disk drive
to  replace  any file it finds in the diskette directory with the
same name, substituting the new file for the old version."
