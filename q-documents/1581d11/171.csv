"What error message is displayed when a write file that has not been closed is reopened for reading?","1581 disk: Controller commands error code 60: WRITE FILE OPEN
    A  write  file that has not been closed is being reopened for
    reading.  This file must be immediately rescued, as described
    in  BASIC  Hint #2  in  Chapter 2,  or it will become a splat
    (improperly closed) file and probably be lost."
