"What are two common BASIC error messages that may occur when working with data files, and how do they relate to INPUT# and PRINT# statements?","1581 disk with basic 7,0:  MORE ABOUT INPUT#

  After you begin using data files regularly,  you  may encounter
two BASIC error messages.  They are  'STRING TOO LONG ERROR'  and
'FILE DATA ERROR'.  Both  are  likely  to halt your program at an
INPUT#  statement,  but  may also have been caused by errors in a
PRINT# statement when the file was written."
