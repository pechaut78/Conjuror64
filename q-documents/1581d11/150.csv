  PRINT#15,'U0>'+CHR$(n)

  Where n = 8 to 30

EXAMPLE:

  Here is a program that sets any device number:

   5 INPUT 'OLD DEVICE NUMBER';ODV
  10 INPUT 'NEW DEVICE NUMBER';DV
  20 IF DV<8 OR DV>30 THEN 10
  30 OPEN 15,ODV,15,'U0>'+CHR$(DV): CLOSE 15

+---------------------------- NOTE -----------------------------+
|   If  you  will  be  using  two  disk  drives,  and  want  to |
| temporarily change the device number of one, you will need to |
| run the above program with the disk drive whose device number |
| not to be changed turned off. After the program has been run, |
| you may turn that drive back on.  If you need to connect more |
| than  two  drives at once,  you will need to use the hardware |
| method of changing device numbers.                            |
