"What are the internal disk commands that expert programmers can use to directly alter the workings of the 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk:  INTERNAL DISK COMMANDS


  Expert  programmers  can  give commands that directly alter the
workings of the  1581,  much as skilled programmers can alter the
workings of BASIC inside the computer with PEEKs,  POKEs  and SYS
calls.  It  is  also  possible to write machine language programs
that  load  and  run entirely within the 1581,  either by writing
them into disk memory from  the  computer,  or  by  loading  them
directly  from diskette into the desired disk memory buffer. This
is  similar  to  loading and running machine language programs in
your computer.
  As when learning to use PEEK,  POKE  and  SYS in your computer,
extreme caution is advised in using the commands in this chapter.
They are essentially machine language commands,  and  lack all of
BASIC's safeguards.  If anything goes wrong, you may have to turn
the disk drive off and on again  (after removing the diskette) to
regain  control.  Do not practice these commands on any important
diskette.  Rather,  make a spare copy and work with that. Knowing
how  to program a 6502 in machine language will help greatly, and
you  will  also need a good memory map of the 1581.  A brief 1581
map appears below."
