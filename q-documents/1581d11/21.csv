"What is the purpose and precautions of using the VALIDATE command on a diskette?","1581 disk:  VALIDATE

  The VALIDATE command recalculates the  Block  Availability  Map
(BAM)  of  the  current  diskette,  allocating only those sectors
still  being  used by valid,  properly-closed files and programs.
All other sectors  (blocks) are left unallocated and free for re-
use, and all improperly closed files are automatically scratched.
This  brief  description  of its workings doesn't indicate either
the power or the danger of the VALIDATE command.  Its power is in
restoring  to  good  health  many  diskettes whose directories or
block availability maps have become muddled.  Any time the blocks
used  by  the  files  on a diskette plus the blocks shown as free
don't add up to the 3160 available on a fresh diskette,  VALIDATE
is  needed,  with  one  exception  below.  Similarly,  any time a
diskette   contains   an  improperly-closed  file  (splat  file),
indicated  by  an  asterisk  (*)  next  to  its  file type in the
directory,  that diskette needs to be validated. In fact, but for
the  one  exception,  it  is  a  good  idea to VALIDATE diskettes
whenever you are the least bit concerned about their integrity.
  The  exception  is diskettes containing direct access files, as
described in Chapter 6.  Most direct access (random) files do not
allocate  their  sectors  in  a  way  the  VALIDATE  command  can
recognize.  Thus, using VALIDATE on such a diskette may result in
unallocating  all  direct  access  files,  with loss of all their
contents   when  other  files  are  added.   Unless  specifically
instructed otherwise, never use VALIDATE on a diskette containing
direct access files."
