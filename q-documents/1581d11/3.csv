"How can you create a sub-directory that lists a single selected type of file using the LOAD or DIRECTORY command?","1581 disk: SELECTIVE DIRECTORIES

  By altering the directory  LOAD command,  you can create a sub-
directory that lists a single selected type of file. For example,
you  could  request  a list of all sequential data files (Chapter
4), or one of all the relative data files (Chapter 5). The format
for this command is:

  LOAD'$0:pattern=filetype',8    (for the C64)

where pattern specifies a particular group of files, and filetype
is  the  one-letter  abbreviation  for  the types of files listed
below:

  P = Program
  S = Sequential
  R = Relative
  U = User

The command for the C128 and Plus/4 is this:

  DIRECTORY'pattern=filetype'

Some examples:

  LOAD'$0:*=R',8  and  DIRECTORY'*=R' display all relative files.

  LOAD'$0:Z*=R',8  and  DIRECTORY'Z*=R'  display  a sub-directory
  consisting of all relative files  that start with the letter Z.
  (the asterisk (*) is explained in the Section 1.10.)"
