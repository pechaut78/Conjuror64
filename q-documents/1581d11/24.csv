"What is the purpose of the PRINT DS$ command and how can it be used in a program to handle disk errors?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: ERROR CHECKING

  When  the  drive  light  (red light) flashes,  you must use the
following command to find out what the error is:

  PRINT DS$

  A  message  is  displayed  whether there is an error or not. If
there  was an error,  this command clears it from disk memory and
turns off the error light on the disk drive.
  Once  the  message  is  on  the  screen,  you can look it up in
Appendix B to see what it means, and what to do about it.
  For those of you who are writing programs,  the  following is a
small error-checking subroutine you can include in your programs:

  59990 REM READ ERROR CHANNEL
  60000 IF DS>1 THEN PRINT DS$: STOP
  60010 RETURN

  The  subroutine  reads  the  error channel and puts the results
into  the  reserved  variables  DS  and  DS$.  They  are  updated
automatically by BASIC.
  Two error numbers are harmless -- 0 means everything is OK, and
1  tells  how  many  files  were  erased  by  a  SCRATCH  command
(described  later  in  this  chapter).  If  the  error  status is
anything else,  line 60000 prints the error message and halts the
program.
  Because  this  is  a  subroutine,  you access it with the BASIC
GOSUB  command,  either  in immediate mode or from a program. The
RETURN  statement  in line 60010 will jump back to immediate mode
or the next statement in your program, whichever is appropriate."
