"What is the syntax and usage of the RENAME command in a diskette directory?","1581 disk:  RENAME

  The RENAME command allows you to alter the name of a program or
other file in the diskette directory. Since only the directory is
affected, RENAME works very quickly.

FORMAT FOR RENAME COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'RENAME0:new name=old name'

or it may be abbreviated as:

  PRINT#15,'R0:new name=old name'

where  'new name' is the name you want the file to have, and 'old
name'  is  the name it has now.  'new name' may be any valid file
name,  up  to  16  characters  in length.  It is assumed you have
already opened file 15 to the command channel.
  One  caution  --  be  sure  the  file you are renaming has been
properly closed before you rename it.

EXAMPLES:

Just before saving a new copy of a 'calendar' program,  you might
type:

  PRINT#15,'R0:CALENDAR/BACKUP=CALENDAR'

Or to move a program called  'BOOT',  currently the first program
on a diskette to someplace else in the directory, you might type:

  PRINT#15,'R0:TEMP=BOOT'

followed by a COPY command (described later),  which turns 'TEMP'
into a new copy of  'BOOT',  and finishing with a SCRATCH command
to get rid of the original copy of 'BOOT'."
