"What is the purpose of the BLOCK-WRITE command in DOS?","1581 disk:  BLOCK-WRITE

The  purpose  of  a BLOCK-WRITE is to save the contents of a file
buffer  into  a  specified sector.  It is thus the reverse of the
BLOCK-READ  command.  Although  the  BLOCK-WRITE command (B-W) is
still  part of the DOS command set,  it is nearly always replaced
by the U2 command.

FORMAT FOR THE BLOCK-WRITE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'U2';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

where  'channel#'  is the channel number specified  when the file
into  which  the  block will be read was opened;  'drive#' is the
drive number;  and  'track#'  and  'sector#' are respectively the
track  and  sector  numbers that should receive the block of data
being saved from the file buffer.

ALTERNATE FORMATS:

  PRINT#15,'U2:'channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  PRINT#15,'UB:'channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  PRINT#15,'U2:channel#,drive#,track#,sector#'

EXAMPLES:

  To restore  Track 40,  Sector 3  of the directory from the disk
buffer filled by a BLOCK-READ, use:

  PRINT#15,'U2';5;0;40;3

You'll return to this example on the next page,  after  you learn
to alter the directory in a useful way.
  You  can  also  use  a  BLOCK-WRITE to write a name in Track 1,
Sector 1,  a  rarely-used  sector.  This  can be used as a way of
marking a diskette  as belonging to you.  Here is a program to do
it, using the alternate form of the BLOCK-WRITE command:

  110 INPUT'YOUR NAME';NA$            Enter a name.
  120 OPEN 15,8,15                    Open command channel.
  130 OPEN 4,8,4,'#'                  Open direct access channel.
  140 PRINT#4,NA$                     Write name to buffer.
  150 PRINT#15,'U2';4;0;1;1           Write buffer to Track1,
  160 CLOSE 4                         Sector 1 of diskette.
  170 CLOSE 15                        Tidy up after.
  180 END

As with the  BLOCK-READ command,  there is a  BLOCK-WRITE command
identical in function to  'U2'  that does not check the track and
sector parameters for valid bounds before attempting to write the
sector. Its format is:

  PRINT#15,'B-o';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  (The character after the B- is a shifted W.)

                       or

  PRINT#15,'B-';CHR$(215);channel#;drive#;track#;sector#"
