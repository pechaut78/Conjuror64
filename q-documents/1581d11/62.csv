"What are the advantages and types of random access files on Commodore disk drives?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: RELATIVE DATA FILES


  Sequential files are very useful  when you're just working with
a continuous stream of data --  i.e. information that can be read
or written all at once.  However, sequential files are not useful
in some situations.  For  example,  after writing a large list of
mail labels,  you wouldn't want to have to reread the entire list
each time you need a person's record. Instead, you need some kind
of random access, a way to get to a particular label in your file
without having to read through all those preceding it.
  As  an  example,  compare  a  record  turntable with a cassette
recorder. You have to listen to a cassette from beginning to end,
but  a  turntable  needle  can  be  picked  up  at  any time, and
instantly moved to any spot on the record.  Your disk drive works
like a turntable in that respect.  In this chapter you will learn
about a type of file that reflects this flexibility.
  Actually,  two  different  types  of random access files may be
used on Commodore disk drives:  relative files  and random files.
Relative  files  are  much more convenient for most data handling
operations,  but  true  random  access  file  commands  are  also
available  to  advanced users,  and will be discussed in the next
chapter."
