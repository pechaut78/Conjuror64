"What is a sequential data file and how does it work on a diskette?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: SEQUENTIAL DATA FILES


  A file on a diskette is just like a file cabinet in your office
-- an organized place to put things. Nearly everything you put on
a diskette goes in one kind of file or another. So far all you've
used are program files,  but there are others.  In  this  chapter
you'll learn about sequential data files.
  The primary purpose of a data file  is to store the contents of
program variables, so they won't be lost when the program ends. A
sequential  data  file  is  one  in  which  the  contents  of the
variables are stored 'in sequence',  one right after another. You
may  already  be  familiar  with  sequential  files  from using a
DATASSETTE,  because  sequential  files on diskette are just like
the  data  files  used  on  cassettes.  Whether  on  cassette  or
diskette, sequential files must be read from beginning to end.
  When  sequential  files  are  created,  information  (data)  is
transferred  byte-by-byte,  through  a buffer,  onto the magnetic
media.  Once  in  the disk drive, program files,  sequential data
files,  and user files all work sequentially.  Even the directory
acts like a sequential file.
  To use sequential files properly, we will learn some more BASIC
words  in  the next few pages.  Then we'll put them together in a
simple but useful program.


|   Besides  sequential  data  files,  two other file types are |
| recorded sequentially on a diskette.  They are program files, |
| and user files.  When you save a program on a diskette, it is |
| saved  in  order  from  beginning  to  end,   just  like  the |
| information in a sequential data file. The main difference is |
| in the commands you use to access it.  User files can be even |
| more similar to sequential data files.  User files are almost |
| never used,  but like program files, they could be treated as |
| though  they  were  sequential  data  files  and  some can be |
| accessed with the same commands.                              |
|   For the advanced user,  the similarity  of the various file |
| types  offers  the possibility of reading a program file into |
| the computer a byte (character) at a time and rewriting it to |
| the diskette in a modified form.                              |"
