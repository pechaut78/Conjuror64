|   The  1581,  as  well  as  other  Commodore  peripherals, is |
| designed   to   support   interfacing  via  software  command |
| structures.  The software commands provided in the 1581 allow |
| for   a   smooth   and  controllable  interface  between  the |
| peripheral  and  CPU.  Although  Commodore  has  provided the |
| mechanism  enabling  users  to  load  and  execute  their own |
| machine language programs within the 1581 system, please keep |
| in mind that Commodore reserves the right to change ROM, RAM, |
| I/O and hardware structure at any time.  Consequently, if the |
| defined software interface is bypassed,  future compatibility |
| of  the  user's machine language software within the 1581 may |
| be in question. The 1581 was not designed primarily as a user |
| programmable  device,  but Commodore recognizes that  certain |
| operations   (such  as  copy  protection)  cannot  be  easily |
| achieved without this ability.                                |


  If  you  find  it  necessary to use machine language within the
1581,  use  the jump table listed in this chapter and Chapter 10.
That  will  lessen the possibility of incompatibility if a future
version of the 1581 changes internally.  Also, let the controller
work for you on the physical level by requesting its help via the
JOB QUEUE.  That  too  will  greatly  increase  the likelihood of
future compatibility."
