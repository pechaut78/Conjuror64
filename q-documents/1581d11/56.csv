"What is the reason behind the 'STRING TOO LONG' error in Commodore's BASIC 7.0 when reading data from a disk file?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: 'STRING TOO LONG' ERROR

  A BASIC string may be up to 255 characters long,  although  the
longest string you can enter via a single INPUT statement is just
under two lines of text. This lower limitation is due to the size
of the input buffer in Commodore's serial bus computers. The same
limit  applies  to  INPUT#  statements.  If a single data element
(string  or  number)  being  read from a disk file into an INPUT#
statement  contains  more  than  88  (BASIC 2)  and 160 (BASIC 7)
characters, BASIC will halt with a 'STRING TOO LONG ERROR'."
