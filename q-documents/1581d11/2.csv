"What is a diskette directory and how is it viewed on a Commodore computer?","DISKETTE DIRECTORY

  A directory is a list of the files on a diskette.  To  view the
directory on the  C128 or Plus/4,  type the word  DIRECTORY  on a
blank line and press the  [RETURN]  key or simply press the  [F3]
key  on  the C128.  That doesn't erase anything in memory, so you
can  call up a directory anytime  --  even from within a program.
The C64 directory command, LOAD'$',8 (press [RETURN]) LIST (press
[RETURN]), does erase what's in memory.
  If a directory doesn't all fit on the screen, it will scroll up
until  it  reaches the last line.  If you want to pause, stop, or
slow  down  the  scrolling,  refer  to your particular computer's
user's manual for instructions as to which keys to use.
  To  get  an  idea  of  what  a  directory  looks like, load the
directory from the Test/Demo diskette.
  The 0 on the left-hand side of the top line is the drive number
of the 1581.  The diskette name is next, followed by the diskette
id  --  both  of  which  are  determined  when  the  diskette  is
formatted.
  The  3D  at the end of the top line means the 1581 uses version
3D of Commodore's disk operating system (DOS).
  Each   of   the   remaining  lines  provides  three  pieces  of
information  about the files on the diskette.  At the left end of
each  line  is  the size of the file in blocks of 254 characters.
Four  blocks  are  equivalent  to  almost 1K of memory inside the
computer.  The  middle  of the line contains the name of the file
enclosed in quotation marks.  All characters within the quotation
marks  are  part  of  the  filename.  The right side of each line
contains a three-letter abbreviation of the file type.  The types
of files are described in later chapters.
  The  bottom  line  of  a  directory  shows  how many blocks are
available  for  use.  This  number  ranges  from  3160 on a newly
formatted diskette to 0 on one that is completely full."
