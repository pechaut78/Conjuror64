"What is the purpose of the BLOCK-READ command in DOS?","1581 disk:  BLOCK-READ

  The  purpose  of  a  BLOCK-READ  is  to  load the contents of a
specified  sector  into  a  file buffer.  Although the BLOCK-READ
command (B-R) is still part of the DOS command set,  it is nearly
always replaced the U1 command (See Chapter 6).

FORMAT FOR THE BLOCK-READ COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'U1';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

where  'channel#'  is  the channel number specified when the file
into  which  the  block will be read was opened,  'drive#' is the
drive number,  and  'track#'  and  'sector#' are respectively the
track  and sector numbers containing the desired block of data to
be read into the file buffer.

ALTERNATE FORMATS:

  PRINT#15,'U1:'channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  PRINT#15,'UA:'channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  PRINT#15,'U1:channel#,drive#,track#,sector#'

EXAMPLE:

  Here  is  a  complete program to read a sector into disk memory
using  U1,  and  from  there into computer memory via GET#. (If a
carriage  return will appear at least once in every 88 characters
of data, INPUT# may be used in place of GET#).

  110 MB=7936: REM $1F00            Define a memory buffer.
  120 INPUT'TRACK TO READ';T        Select a track
  130 INPUT'SECTOR TO READ';S       and sector.
  140 OPEN 15,8,15                  Open command channel.
  150 OPEN 5,8,5,'#'                Open direct access channel.
  160 PRINT#15,'U1';5;0;T;S         Read sector into disk buffer.
  170 FOR I=MB TO MB+255            Use a loop to
  180 GET#5,A$: IF A$=''            copy disk buffer
      THEN A$=CHR$(0)               into computer memory.
  190 POKE I,ASC(A$)
  200 NEXT
  210 CLOSE 5:CLOSE 15              Tidy up after.
  220 END

  As the loop progresses, the contents of the specified track and
sector are copied into computer memory,  beginning at the address
set by variable MB in line 160,  and  may be examined and altered
there.

  The  DOS  always checks that the track and sector parameters of
the  BLOCK-READ  command are within the proper range.  If they're
not,  a '66, ILLEGAL TRACK AND SECTOR'  error occurs.  In certain
instances it might be necessary to access a track and sector that
are not within what the DOS considers the proper bounds.  This is
a  special  case  and,  unless  absolutely  necessary,  should be
avoided. Nonetheless, there is a command identical in function to
'U1' that doesn't check to see if the track and sector parameters
are within bounds before attempting to read it. Its format is:

  PRINT#15,'B-_';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  (The character following the B- is a shifted R.)

                        or

  PRINT#15,'B-';CHR$(210);channel#;drive#;track#;sector#"
