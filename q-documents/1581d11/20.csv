"What is the syntax and usage of the COPY command on a Commodore 1581 disk drive?","1581 disk:  COPY

  The COPY command allows you to make a spare copy of any program
or file on a diskette.  On a single drive like the 1581, the copy
must  be  on  the  same diskette,  which means it must be given a
different name from the file copied. It's also used to combine up
to  four sequential data file  (linking the files one to another,
end  to end in a chain).  Files are linked in the order and other
files  on  the  diskette  are  not changed.  Files must be closed
before they are copied or linked.

FORMAT FOR THE COPY COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'COPYdrive#:new file=old file'

EXAMPLES:

  PRINT#15,'COPY0:BACKUP=ORIGINAL'

or abbreviated as:

  PRINT#15,'Cdrive#:new file=old file'

  PRINT#15,'C0:BACKUP=ORIGINAL'

where  'drive#'  is the drive number  'new file'  is the copy and
'old file' is the original.

FORMAT FOR THE COMBINE OPTION:

  PRINT#15,'Cdrive#:new file=file 1,file 2,file 3,file 4'

where 'drive#' is always 0,
