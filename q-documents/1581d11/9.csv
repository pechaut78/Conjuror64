"What command should you type to properly close all open disk files in BASIC when it halts with an error?","1581 disk:  If  BASIC  halts with an error when you have files open, BASIC
aborts  them  without closing them properly on the disk. To close
them properly on the disk, you must type:

  CLOSE 15: OPEN 15,8,15,'I': CLOSE 15

This  opens  the command channel and immediately closes it, along
with all other disk files.  Failure to close a disk file properly
both  in  BASIC  and  on the disk may result in losing the entire
file."
