"What is the purpose and functionality of the BUFMOVE_DV command in a 1581 disk controller job?","1581 disk Controller Job commands: BUFMOVE_DV
    $9E     Moves data between the job queue buffer and
                      the track cache buffer. The track parameter
                      in  the  job  queue denotes the position in
                      the track cache buffer to transfer to/from.
                      The sector parameter denotes the following:
                        Bit 7 :  Direction  (1 = to  track  cache
                                 buffer)
                        Bit 6 :  Mark Flag  (set/clear the 'track
                                 cache modified' flag)
                        Bit 5 :  Transfer (1 = do the transfer)
                        Bits 4-0:# of 256 byte blocks to transfer
                      With bit 7 set,  the corresponding physical
                      track  position  in  the  job queue (HDRS2)
                      must  be updated for the purpose of telling
                      the  controller  what  physical  track  the
                      track cache buffer belongs to.  In addition
                      the side var (SIDS) must also be updated."
