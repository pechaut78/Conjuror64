"What is the command to format a new diskette on a Commodore computer?","HOW TO PREPARE A NEW DISKETTE

  A diskette needs a pattern of circular magnetic tracks in order
for  the  drive's  read/write  head  to  find  things on it. This
pattern is not on your diskettes  when you buy them,  but you can
use  the  HEADER  command  or  the  NEW  command  to  add it to a
diskette.  That  is  known  as  formatting the disk.  This is the
command to use with the C128 in C128 mode or Plus/4:

  HEADER 'diskette name',Iid,Ddrive#[,Udevice#]

where 'diskette name' is any desired name for the diskette, up to
16  characters  long  (including spaces).  'id'  can  be  any two
characters as long as they don't form a BASIC keyword (such as IF
or  ON)  either  on  their own or with the capital I before them.
'drive#' is 0.  'device#' is 8, unless you have changed it as per
instructions in Appendix A  (the 1581 assumes 8 even if you don't
type it in).

  The command for the C64, VIC 20, or C128 in C64 mode is this:

  OPEN 15,device#,15,'NEWdrive#:diskette name,id'
  CLOSE 15

  The  device#,  drive#,  diskette  name,  and id are the same as
described above."
