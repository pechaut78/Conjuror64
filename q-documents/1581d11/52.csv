"What is the syntax and usage of the CLOSE statement in BASIC 2.0 and BASIC 7.0, and how can you close all open files at once?","1581 disk with basic 7,0: FORMAT FOR THE CLOSE STATEMENT:

  BASIC 7.0:  DCLOSE#file#[,Udevice#]
  BASIC 2.0:  CLOSE file#

where 'file#' is the same file number given in the desired file's
current OPEN statement.

EXAMPLES:

  To  close  the  data file #5 used as an example on the previous
page, use:

  BASIC 7.0:  DCLOSE#5
  BASIC 2.0:  CLOSE 5

  In BASIC 7.0,  when the DCLOSE statement is used alone (no # or
file# parameters),  it closes all disk files at once.  With a bit
of planning, the same can be done via a program loop. Since there
is no harm in closing a file  that wasn't open,  close every file
you  even  think  might  be  open before ending a program. If you
always gave your files numbers  between 1 and 5,  you could close
them all with

  9950 FOR I=1 TO 5
  9960 CLOSE I
  9970 GOSUB 59990: REM CHECK FOR DISK ERRORS
  9980 NEXT I

assuming your program includes an error check subroutine like the
one in the last chapter."
