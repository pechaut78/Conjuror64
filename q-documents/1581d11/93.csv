"What is the command and its format to load a machine language routine from a diskette into a memory buffer and execute it?","1581 disk:  BLOCK-EXECUTE

  This  rarely-used  command  will  load  a  sector  containing a
machine  language routine into a memory buffer from diskette, and
execute  it  from  the first location within the buffer,  until a
ReTurn from Subroutine (RTS) instruction ends the command.

FORMAT FOR THE BLOCK-EXECUTE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'B-E:';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#

where  'channel#'  is  the channel number specified when the file
into which the block will be loaded was opened,  'drive#'  is the
drive number,  and  'track#'  and  'sector#' are respectively the
track  and sector numbers containing the desired block of data to
be loaded into the file buffer and executed there.

ALTERNATE FORMATS:

  PRINT#15,'B-E:';channel#;drive#;track#;sector#
  PRINT#15,'B-E:channel#,drive#,track#,sector#'

EXAMPLES:

  Assuming  you've  written a machine language program onto Track
1,  Sector 8  of  a diskette,  and would like to run it in buffer
number 1  in  disk  memory  (starting  at $0400 hexadecimal), you
could do so as follows:

110 OPEN 15,8,15               Open command channel.
120 OPEN 2,8,2,'#1'            Open direct access channel to
                               buffer 1.
130 PRINT#15,'B-E:';2;0;1;8    Load Track1, Sector 8 in it
                               & execute.
140 CLOSE 2                    Tidy up after.
150 CLOSE 15
160 END"
