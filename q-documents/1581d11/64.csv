"What are the limitations and benefits of using relative files in DOS?","FILE LIMITS

  With  relative  files,  you  don't  have to worry about exactly
where  on  the  diskette's surface a given record will be stored,
or  whether  it will fit properly within the current disk sector,
or need to be extended onto the next available sector.  DOS takes
care of all that for you.  All you need to do is specify how long
each  record  is,  in bytes,  and how many records you will need.
DOS  will do the rest,  and organize things in such a way that it
can  quickly find any record in the file,  as soon as it is given
the record number (ordinal position within the file).
  The  only  limit that will concern you is that each record must
be  the  same  size,  and  the  record  length you choose must be
between 2 and 254 characters.  Naturally the entire file also has
to fit on your diskette, along with any other existing file(s)."
