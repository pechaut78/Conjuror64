"What is the error message and explanation for error code 70: NO CHANNEL?","1581 disk: Controller commands error code 70: NO CHANNEL (available)
    The requested channel is not available or all channels are in
    use. A maximum of three sequential files or one relative file
    plus one sequential file may be opened at one time,  plus the
    command channel. Do not omit the drive number in a sequential
    OPEN command, or only two sequential files can be used. Close
    all files as soon as you no longer need them."
