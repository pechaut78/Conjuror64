"What is the format of the OPEN statement to create or reopen a relative file in BASIC 7.0 and BASIC 2.0?","CREATING A RELATIVE FILE

  When a relative file is to be used for the first time, its OPEN
statement will create the file; after that, the OPEN statement is
used to reopen the file for both reading and writing.

FORMAT STATEMENT TO OPEN A RELATIVE FILE:

  BASIC 7.0: DOPEN#file#,'file name',Lrecord length
             [,Ddrive#][,Udevice#]
  BASIC 2.0: OPENfile#,device#,channel#,'drive#:file name,L,'+
             CHR$(record length)

where  'file#' is the file number,  normally an integer between 1
and 127; 'device#' is the device number to be used, normally 8 on
the  1581;  'channel#'  selects  a particular channel along which
communications  for this file can take place,  normally between 2
and 14;  'drive#' is the drive number,  always 0 on the 1581; and
'file name' is the name of the file,  with a maximum length of 16
characters.  Pattern  matching characters are allowed in the name
when accessing an existing file, but not when creating a new one.
The  record  length is the size of each record within the file in
bytes used, including carriage returns, quotation marks and other
special characters.


|  o Do not precede the file name  (in BASIC 7.0)  or the drive |
| number  (in BASIC 2.0)  with  the 'at' sign (@);  there is no |
| reason to replace a relative file.                            |
|  o L record length (in BASIC 7.0) or ,L,'+CHR$(record length) |
| (in BASIC 2.0) is only required when a relative file is first |
| created,  though it may be used later,  so long as the record |
| length is the same as when the file was first created.  Since |
| relative files may be read from or written to alternately and |
| with  equal  case,  there is no need to specify Read or Write |
| mode when opening a relative file.                            |
|  o 'file#',  'device#'  and  'channel#' must be valid numeric |
| constants, variables or expressions.  The rest of the command |
| must be a valid string literal,  variable  or  expression. In |
| BASIC 7.0 DOPEN, whenever a variable or expression is used as |
| a file name it must be surrounded by parentheses.             |

EXAMPLES:

  To create or reopen a relative file named  'GRADES',  of record
length 100 use:

  BASIC 7.0: DOPEN#2,'GRADES',L100,D0,U8
  BASIC 2.0: OPEN 2,8,2,'GRADES,L,'+CHR$(100)

  To  reopen  an  unknown relative file of the user's choice that
has already been created, use:

  BASIC 7.0:  200 INPUT'WHICH FILE';FI$
              210 DOPEN#5,(FI$),D0,U8
  BASIC 2.0:  200 INPUT'WHICH FILE';FI$
              210 OPEN 5,8,5,FI$"
