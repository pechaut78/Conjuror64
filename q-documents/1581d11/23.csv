"What is the command to re-read the directory of a diskette into a disk buffer when the information becomes unreliable?","1581 disk: INITIALIZE

  When  a  diskette is inserted into the drive,  its directory is
automatically  re-read  into  a  disk  buffer.  You would use the
command only if that information became unreliable.

FORMAT FOR THE INITIALIZE COMMAND:

  PRINT#15,'INITIALIZEdrive#'

or it may be abbreviated to

  PRINT#15,'Idrive#'

EXAMPLE:

  PRINT#15,'I0'

  PRINT#15,'INITIALIZE0'

where the command channel is assumed to be opened by file 15, and
'drive#' is 0."
