"What are the memory locations of the color registers on C64?","SPRITE COLORS

    A sprite can be any of the 16 colors generated by the VIC-II chip. Each
  of the sprites has its own sprite color register. These are the memory
  locations of the color registers:

        53288   ($D028)     description:    SPRITE 1 COLOR REGISTER
        53289   ($D029)     description:    SPRITE 2 COLOR REGISTER
        53290   ($D02A)     description:    SPRITE 3 COLOR REGISTER
        53291   ($D02B)     description:    SPRITE 4 COLOR REGISTER
        53292   ($D02C)     description:    SPRITE 5 COLOR REGISTER
        53293   ($D02D)     description:    SPRITE 6 COLOR REGISTER
        53294   ($D02E)     description:    SPRITE 7 COLOR REGISTER

    All dots in the sprite will be displayed in the color contained in the
  sprite color register. The rest of the sprite will be transparent, and
  will show whatever is behind the sprite."
