"HWhat is the purpose of the CHROUT routine in the KERNAL?","B-5. Function Name: CHROUT

    Purpose: Output a character
    Call address: $FFD2 (hex) 65490 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: (CHKOUT,OPEN)
    Error returns: 0 (See READST)
    Stack requirements: 8+
    Registers affected: A

    Description: This routine outputs a character to an already opened
  channel. Use the KERNAL OPEN and CHKOUT routines to set up the output
  channel before calling this routine, If this call is omitted, data is
  sent to the default output device (number 3, the screen). The data byte
  to be output is loaded into the accumulator, and this routine is called.
  The data is then sent to the specified output device. The channel is left
  open after the call.

 
 NOTE: Care must be taken when using this routine to send data to a    
 specific serial device since data will be sent to all open output     
 channels on the bus. Unless this is desired, all open output channels 
 on the serial bus other than the intended destination channel must be 
 closed by a call to the KERNAL CLRCHN routine.                        

  How to Use:

    0) Use the CHKOUT KERNAL routine if needed, (see description above).
    1) Load the data to be output into the accumulator.
    2) Call this routine.

  EXAMPLE:

    ;DUPLICATE THE BASIC INSTRUCTION CMD 4,'A';
    LDX #4          ;LOGICAL FILE #4
    JSR CHKOUT      ;OPEN CHANNEL OUT
    LDA #'A
    JSR CHROUT      ;SEND CHARACTER"
