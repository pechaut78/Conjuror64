"What is the primary function of the serial bus in the Commodore 64?","THE SERIAL BUS

    The serial bus is a daisy chain arrangement designed to let the Com-
  modore 64 communicate with devices such as the VIC-1541 DISK DRIVE and
  the VIC-1525 GRAPHICS PRINTER. The advantage of the serial bus is that
  more than one device can be connected to the port. Up to 5 devices can be
  connected to the serial bus at one time.
    There are three types of operation over a serial bus-CONTROL, TALK, and
  LISTEN. A CONTROLLER device is one which controls operation of the serial
  bus. A TALKER transmits data onto the bus. A LISTENER receives data from
  the bus.
    The Commodore 64 is the controller of the bus. It also acts as a TALKER
  (when sending data to the printer, for example) and as a LISTENER (when
  loading a program from the disk drive, for example). Other devices may be
  either LISTENERS (the printer), TALKERS, or both (the disk drive). Only
  the Commodore 64 can act as the controller.
    All devices connected on the serial bus will receive all the data
  transmitted over the bus. To allow the Commodore 64 to route data to its
  intended destination, each device has a bus ADDRESS. By using this device
  address, the Commodore 64 can control access to the bus. Addresses on the
  serial bus range from 4 to 31.
    The Commodore 64 can COMMAND a particular device to TALK or LISTEN.
  When the Commodore 64 commands a device to TALK, the device will begin
  putting data onto the serial bus. When the Commodore 64 commands a device
  to LISTEN, the device addressed will get ready to receive data (from the
  Commodore 64 or from another device on the bus). Only one device can TALK
  on the bus at a time; otherwise, the data will collide and the system
  will crash in confusion. However, any number of devices can LISTEN at the
  same time to one TALKER.

                         COMMON SERIAL BUS ADDRESSES
                    +--------+--------------------------+
                    | NUMBER |        DEVICE            |
                    +--------+--------------------------+
                    | 4 or 5 | VIC-1525 GRAPHIC PRINTER |
                    | 8      | VIC-1541 DISK DRIVE      |
                    +--------+--------------------------+

    Other device addresses are possible. Each device has its own address.
  Certain devices (like the Commodore 64 printer) provide a choice between
  two addresses for the convenience of the user.
    The SECONDARY ADDRESS is to let the Commodore 64 transmit setup
  information to a device. For example, to OPEN a connection on the bus to
  the printer, and have it print in UPPER/LOWER case, use the following

    OPEN 1,4,7

  where,
    1 is the logical file number (the number you PRINT# to),
    4 is the ADDRESS of the printer, and
    7 is the SECONDARY ADDRESS that tells the printer to go into UPPER/
      LOWER case mode.

    There are 6 lines used in serial bus operations - input and 3 output.
  The 3 input lines bring data, control, and timing signals into the Com-
  modore 64. The 3 output lines send data, control, and timing signals from
  the Commodore 64 to external devices on the serial bus.
