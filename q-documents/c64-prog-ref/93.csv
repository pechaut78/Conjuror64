"What is the primary purpose of the Y index register in a C64?","THE Y INDEX REGISTER

    This is a very important register. There are instructions for nearly
  all of the transformations you can make to the accumulator, and the X
  register. But there are other instructions for things that only the Y
  register can do. Various machine language instructions allow you to copy
  the contents of a memory location into the Y register, copy the contents
  of the Y register into a memory location, and modify the contents of the
  Y, or some other register directly."
