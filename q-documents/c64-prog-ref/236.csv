"How can I get data from an RS-232 channel on a Commodore 64?","GETTING DATA FROM AN RS-232 CHANNEL

    When getting data from an RS-232 channel, the Commodore 64 receiver
  buffer will hold up to 255 characters before the buffer overflows. This
  is indicated in the RS-232 status word (ST in BASIC, or RSSTAT in machine
  language). If an overflow occurs, then all characters received during a
  full buffer condition, from that point on, are lost. Obviously, it pays
  to keep the buffer as clear as possible.
    If you wish to receive RS-232 data at high speeds (BASIC can only go so
  fast, especially considering garbage collects. This can cause the re-
  ceiver buffer to overflow), you will have to use machine language
  routines to handle this type of data burst.

  BASIC SYNTAX:

    Recommended: GET#lfn, <string variable>
    NOT Recommended: INPUT#lfn <variable list>

  KERNAL ENTRIES:

    CHKIN ($FFC6)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.
    GETIN ($FFE4)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.
    CHRIN ($FFCF)-See Memory Map for more information on entry and exit
  conditions.

  |   If the word length is less than 8 bits, all unused bit(s) will be   |
  | assigned a value of zero.                                             |
  |   If a GET# does not find any data in the buffer, the character '' (a |
  | null) is returned.                                                    |
  |   If INPUT# is used, then the system will hang in a waiting condition |
  | until a non-null character and a following carriage return is         |
  | received. Therefore, if the Clear To Send (CTS) or Data Set Ready     |
  | (DSR) line(s) disappear during character INPUT#, the system will hang |
  | in a RESTORE-only state. This is why the INPUT# and CHRIN routines are|
  | NOT recommended.                                                      |
  |   The routine CHKIN handles the x-line handshake which follows the EIA|
  | standard (August 1979) for RS-232-C interfaces. (The Request To Send  |
  | (RTS), CTS, and Received line signal (DCD) lines are implemented with |
  | the Commodore 64 computer defined as the Data Terminal device.)       |"
