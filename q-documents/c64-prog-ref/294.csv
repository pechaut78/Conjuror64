"Describe how sprite priority works","PRIORITY

    The priority of each sprite may be individually controlled with respect to
  the other displayed information from character or bit map modes. The
  priority of each sprite is set by the corresponding bit (MnDP) of register
  27 ($1B) as follows:

     REG BIT  |          PRIORITY TO CHARACTER OR BIT MAP DATA
        0     |  Non-transparent sprite data will be displayed (sprite in front)
        1     |  Non-transparent sprite data will be displayed only instead of
              |  Bkgd #0 or multi-color bit pair 01 (sprite behind)


                          sprite-DISPLAY DATA PRIORITY
                       |   MnDP = 1   |   MnDP = 0   |
                       |  spriten     |  Foreground  |
                       |  Foreground  |  spriten     |
                       |  Background  |  Background  |


  sprite data bits of '0' ('00' in multi-color mode) are transparent, always
  permitting any other information to be displayed.
    The sprites have a fixed priority with respect to each other, with sprite 0
  having the highest priority and sprite 7 the lowest. When sprite data (except
  transparent data) of two sprites are coincident, the data from the lower
  number sprite will be displayed. sprite vs. sprite data is prioritized before
  priority resolution with character or bit map data."
