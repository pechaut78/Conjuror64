  MEMORY LOCATION:

    You must 'reserve' a separate 64-BYTE BLOCK of numbers in the
  computer's memory for each sprite of which 63 BYTES will be used for
  sprite data. The memory settings shown below are recommended for the
  'sprite pointer' settings in the chart above. Each sprite will be unique
  and you'll have to define it as you wish. To make all sprites exactly the
  same, point the sprites you want to look the same to the same register
  for sprites."
