"What is the primary purpose of the X index register in a C64?","THE X INDEX REGISTER

    This is a very important register. There are instructions for nearly
  all of the transformations you can make to the accumulator. But there are
  other instructions for things that only the X register can do. Various
  machine language instructions allow you to copy the contents of a memory
  location into the X register, copy the contents of the X register into a
  memory location, and modify the contents of the X, or some other register
  directly."
