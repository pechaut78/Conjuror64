"What are the key considerations and limitations when positioning sprites horizontally in a graphics system?","HORIZONTAL POSITIONING

    Positioning in the horizontal direction is more complicated because
  there are more than, 256 positions. This means that an extra bit, or 9th
  bit is used to control the X position. By adding the extra bit when
  necessary a sprite now has 512 possible positions in the left/right, X,
  direction. This makes more possible combinations than can be seen on the
  visible part of the screen. Each sprite can have a position from 0 to
  511. However, only those values between 24 and 343 are visible on the
  screen. If the X position of a sprite is greater than 255 (on the right
  side of the screen), the bit in the X MOST SIGNIFICANT BIT POSITION

  register must be set to a 1 (turned ON). If the X position of a sprite is
  less than 256 (on the left side of the screen), then the X MSB of that
  sprite must be 0 (turned OFF). Bits 0 to 7 of the X MSB register
  correspond to sprites 0 to 7, respectively."
