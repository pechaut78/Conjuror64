"What is the 6526 handshaking?","6256 Handshaking

    Handshaking on data transfers can be accomplished using the /PC output
  pin and the FLAG input pin. PC will go low for one cycle following a read
  or write of PORT B. This signal can be used to indicate 'data ready' at
  PORT B or 'data accepted' from PORT B. Handshaking on 16-bit data
  transfers (using both PORT A and PORT B) is possible by always reading or
  writing PORT A first. /FLAG is a negative edge sensitive input which can
  be used for receiving the /PC output from another 6526, or as a general
  purpose interrupt input. Any negative transition of /FLAG will set the
  /FLAG interrupt bit.


  Interval Timers (Timer A, Timer B)

    Each interval timer consists of a 16-bit read-only Timer Counter and a
  16-bit write-only Timer Latch. Data written to the timer are latched in
  the Timer Latch, while data read from the timer are the present contents
  of the Time Counter. The timers can be used independently or linked for
  extended operations. The various timer modes allow generation of long
  time delays, variable width pulses, pulse trains and variable frequency
  waveforms. Utilizing the CNT input, the timers can count external pulses
  or measure frequency, pulse width and delay times of external signals.
  Each timer has an associated control register, providing independent
  control of the following functions:

  Start/Stop

    A control bit allows the timer to be started or stopped by the micro-
  processor at any time.

  PB On/Off:

    A control bit allows the timer output to appear on a PORT B output line
  (PB6 for TIMER A and PB7 for TIMER B). This function overrides the DDRB
  control bit and forces the appropriate PB line to an output.

  Toggle/Pulse

    A control bit selects the output applied to PORT B. On every timer
  underflow the output can either toggle or generate a single positive
  pulse of one cycle duration. The Toggle output is set high whenever the
  timer is started and is set low by /RES.

  One-Shot/Continuous

    A control bit selects either timer mode. In one-shot mode, the timer
  will count down from the latched value to zero, generate an interrupt,
  reload the latched value, then stop. In continuous mode, the timer will
  count from the latched value to zero, generate' an interrupt, reload the
  latched value and repeat the procedure continuously.

  Force Load

    A strobe bit allows the timer latch to be loaded into the timer counter
  at any time, whether the timer is running or not.

  Input Mode:

    Control bits allow selection of the clock used to decrement the timer.
  TIMER A can count 02 clock pulses or external pulses applied to the CNT
  pin. TIMER B can count (02 pulses, external CNT pulses, TIMER A underflow
  pulses or TIMER A underflow pulses while the CNT pin is held high.

    The timer latch is loaded into the timer on any timer underflow, on a
  force load or following a write to the high byte of the prescaler while
  the timer is stopped. If the timer is running, a write to the high byte
  will load the timer latch, but not reload the counter."
