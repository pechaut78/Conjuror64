"What is the primary function of the built-in program that interprets and executes CBM BASIC commands on the Commodore 64?","The C64 OPERATING SYSTEM of the Commodore 64 then allows you to type on the
  keyboard, and use the built-in SCREEN EDITOR on the Commodore 64. The
  SCREEN EDITOR allows you to move the cursor, DELete, INSert, etc., and
  is, in fact, only one part of the operating system that is built in for
  your convenience.
    All of the commands that are available in CBM BASIC are simply
  recognized by another huge machine language program built into your
  Commodore 64. This huge program 'RUNS' the appropriate piece of machine
  language depending on which CBM BASIC command is being executed. This
  program is called the BASIC INTERPRETER, because it interprets each
  command, one by one, unless it encounters a command it does not
  understand, and then the familiar message appears:

    ?SYNTAX ERROR

    READY."
