"How can I handle the paddles?","PADDLES

    A paddle is connected to both CIA #1 and the SID chip (MOS 6581 Sound
  Interface Device) through a game port. The paddle value is read via the
  SID registers 54297 ($D419) and 54298 ($D41A). PADDLES ARE NOT RELIABLE
  WHEN READ FROM BASIC ALONE!!!! The best way to use paddles, from BASIC or
  machine code, is to use the following machine language routine... (SYS to
  it from BASIC then PEEK the memory locations used by the subroutine).
