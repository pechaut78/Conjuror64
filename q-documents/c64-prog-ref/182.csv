"What is the purpose of the CIOUT routine in a serial communication system?","B-6. Function Name: CIOUT

    Purpose: Transmit a byte over the serial bus
    Call address: $FFA8 (hex) 65448 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: LISTEN, [SECOND]
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 5
    Registers affected: None

    Description: This routine is used to send information to devices on the
  serial bus. A call to this routine will put a data byte onto the serial
  bus using full serial handshaking. Before this routine is called, the
  LISTEN KERNAL routine must be used to command a device on the serial bus
  to get ready to receive data. (If a device needs a secondary address, it
  must also be sent by using the SECOND KERNAL routine.) The accumulator is
  loaded with a byte to handshake as data on the serial bus. A device must
  be listening or the status word will return a timeout. This routine
  always buffers one character. (The routine holds the previous character
  to be sent back.) So when a call to the KERNAL UNLSN routine is made to
  end the data transmission, the buffered character is sent with an End Or
  Identify (EOI) set. Then the UNLSN command is sent to the device.
  How to Use:

    0) Use the LISTEN KERNAL routine (and the SECOND routine if needed).
    1) Load the accumulator with a byte of data.
    2) Call this routine to send the data byte.

  EXAMPLE:


    LDA #'X       ;SEND AN X TO THE SERIAL BUS
    JSR CIOUT"
