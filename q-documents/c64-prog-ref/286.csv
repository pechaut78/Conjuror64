"What is the purpose of the video matrix counter?","VCx denotes the video matrix counter outputs, RCx denotes the 3-bit
  raster line counter and CB13 is from register 24 ($18). The video matrix
  counter steps through the same 40 locations for eight raster lines, con-
  tinuing to the next 40 locations every eighth line, while the raster
  counter increments once for each horizontal video line (raster line).
  This addressing results in each eight sequential memory locations being
  formatted as an 8*8 dot block on the video display."
