"What is the purpose of the Commodore CP/M cartridge?","Z-80 MICROPROCESSOR CARTRIDGE

  Peripherals are things like Datassette(TM) recorders, disk
  drives, printers, and modems. All these items can be added to your
  Commodore 64 through the various ports and sockets on the back of your
  machine. The thing that makes Commodore peripherals so good is the fact
  that our peripherals are 'intelligent.' That means that they don't take
  up valuable Random Access Memory space when they're in use. You're free
  to use all 64K of memory in your Commodore 64.
    Another advantage of your Commodore 64 is the fact most programs you
  write on your Commodore 64 today will be upwardly compatible with any new
  Commodore computer you buy in the future. This is partially because of
  the qualities of the computer's Operating System (OS).
    However, there is one thing that the Commodore OS can't do: make your
  programs compatible with a computer made by another company.
    Most of the time you won't even have to think about using another com-
  pany's computer, because your Commodore 64 is so easy to use. But for the
  occasional user who wants to take advantage of software that may not be
  available in Commodore 64 format we have created a Commodore CP/M(R)
  cartridge.
    CP/M(R) is not a 'computer dependent' operating system. Instead it uses
  some of the memory space normally available for programming to run its
  own operating system. There are advantages and disadvantages to this. The
  disadvantages are that the programs you write will have to be shorter
  than the programs you can write using the Commodore 64's built-in
  operating system. In addition, you can NOT use the Commodore 64's
  powerful screen editing capabilities. The advantages are that you can now
  use a large amount of software that has been specifically designed for
  CP/M(R) and the Z-80 microprocessor, and the programs that you write
  using the CP/M(R) operating system can be transported and run on any
  other computer that has CP/M(R) and a Z-80 card.
    By the way, most computers that have a Z-80 microprocessor require that
  you go inside the computer to actually install a Z-80 card. With this
  method you have to be very careful not to disturb the delicate circuitry
  that runs the rest of the computer. The Commodore CP/M& cartridge
  eliminates this hassle because our Z-80 cartridge plugs into the back of
  your Commodore 64 quickly and easily, without any messy wires that can
  cause problems later."
