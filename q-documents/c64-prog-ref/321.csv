"What is the MODE/VOL (Register $18) register?","MODE/VOL (Register $18)

    Bits 4-7 of this register select various Filter mode and output
  options:
    LP (Bit 4): When set to a one, the Low-Pass output of the Filter is
  selected and sent to the audio output. For a given Filter input signal,
  all frequency components below the Filter Cutoff Frequency are passed
  unaltered, while all frequency components above the Cutoff are attenuated
  at a rate of 12 dB/Octave. The Low-Pass mode produces fullbodied sounds.
    BP (Bit 5): Same as bit 4 for the Bandpass output. All frequency
  components above and below the Cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 6
  dB/Octave. The Bandpass mode produces thin, open sounds.
    HP (Bit 6): Same as bit 4 for the High-Pass output. All frequency
  components above the Cutoff are passed unaltered, while all frequency
  components below the Cutoff are attenuated at a rate of 12 dB/Octave.
  The High-Pass mode produces tinny, buzzy sounds.
    3 OFF (Bit 7): When set to a one, the output of Voice 3 is disconnected
  from the direct audio path. Setting Voice 3 to bypass the Filter
  (FILT 3 = 0) and setting 3 OFF to a one prevents Voice 3 from reaching
  the audio output. This allows Voice 3 to be used for modulation purposes
  without any undesirable output.

  | NOTE: The Filter output modes ARE additive and multiple Filter modes  |
  | may be selected simultaneously. For example, both LP and HP modes can |
  | be selected to produce a Notch (or Band Reject) Filter response. In   |
  | order for the Filter to have any audible effect, at least one Filter  |
  | output must be selected and at least one Voice must be routed through |
  | the Filter. The Filter is, perhaps, the most important element in SID |
  | as it allows the generation of complex tone colors via subtractive    |
  | synthesis (the Filter is used to eliminate specific frequency         |
  | components from a harmonically rich input signal). The best results   |
  | are achieved by varying the Cutoff Frequency in real-time.            |


    Bits 0-3 (VOL0-VOL3) select 1 of 16 overall Volume levels for the final
  composite audio output. The output volume levels range from no output (0)
  to maximum volume (15 or $F) in 16 linear steps. This control can be used
  as a static volume control for balancing levels in multi-chip systems or
  for creating dynamic volume effects, such as Tremolo. Some Volume level
  other than zero must be selected in order for SID to produce any sound."
