"What is the recommended location for machine language routines on the Commodore 64?","WHERE TO PUT MACHINE LANGUAGE ROUTINES

    The best place for machine language routines on the Commodore 64 is
  from $C000-$CFFF, assuming the routines are smaller than 4K bytes long.
  This section of memory is not disturbed by BASIC.
    If for some reason it's not possible or desirable to put the machine
  language routine at $C000, for instance if the routine is larger than 4K
  bytes, it then becomes necessary to reserve an area at the top of memory
  from BASIC for the routine. The top of memory is normally $9FFF. The top
  of memory can be changed through the KERNAL routine MEMTOP, or by the
  following BASIC statements:

    10 POKE51,L:POKE52,H:POKE55,1:POKE56,H:CLR

  Where H and L are the high and low portions, respectively, of the new
  top of memory. For example, to reserve the area from $9000 to $9FFF for
  machine language, use the following:

    10 POKE5110:POKE52,144:POKE5510:POKE56,144:CLR"
