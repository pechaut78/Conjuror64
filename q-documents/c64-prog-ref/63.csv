"What determines the order in which sprites appear on the screen when they overlap?","SPRITE PRIORITIES

    You can actually make different sprites seem to move IN FRONT OF or
  BEHIND each other on the screen. This incredible three dimensional illu-
  sion is achieved by the built-in SPRITE PRIORITIES which determine which
  sprites have priority over the others when 2 or more sprites OVERLAP on
  the screen.
    The rule is 'first come, first served' which means lower-numbered
  sprites AUTOMATICALLY have priority over higher-numbered sprites. For
  example, if you display sprite 0 and sprite 1 so they overlap on the
  screen, sprite 0 will appear to be IN FRONT OF sprite 1. Actually, sprite
  0 always supersedes all the other sprites because it's the lowest num-
  bered sprite. In comparison, sprite 1 has priority over sprites 2-7;
  sprite 2 has priority over sprites 3-7, etc. Sprite 7 (the last sprite)
  has LESS PRIORITY than any of the other sprites, and will always appear
  to be displayed 'BEHIND' any other sprites which overlap its position.
    To illustrate how priorities work, change lines 50, 60, and 70 in the
  program above to the following:


  50 POKEV,24:POKEV+1,50:POKEV+16,0
  60 POKEV+2,34:POKEV+3,60
  70 POKEV+4,44:POKEV+5,70


  You should see a white sprite on top of a yellow sprite on top of an
  orange sprite. Of course, now that you see how priorities work, you can
  also MOVE SPRITES and take advantage of these priorities in your ani-
  mation."
