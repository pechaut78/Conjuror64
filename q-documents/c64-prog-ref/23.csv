"What is the primary difference between multi-color bit map mode and standard (HI-RES) bit mapped mode?","MULTI-COLOR BET MAP MODE

    Like multi-color mode characters, multi-color bit map mode allows you
  to display up to four different colors in each 8 by 8 section of bit map.
  And as in multi-character mode, there is a sacrifice of horizontal
  resolution (from 320 dots to 160 dots).
    Multi-color bit map mode uses an 8K section of memory for the bit map.
  You select your colors for multi-color bit map mode from (1) the
  background color register 0, (the screen background color), (2) the video
  matrix (the upper 4 bits give one possible color, the lower 4 bits an-
  other), and (3) color memory.
    Multi-color bit mapped mode is turned ON by setting bit 5 of 53265
  ($D011) and bit 4 at location 53270 ($D016) to a 1. The following POKE
  does this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53625)OR 32: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)OR 16
  
	Multi-color bit mapped mode is turned OFF by setting bit 5 of 53265
  ($D011) and bit 4 at location 53270 ($D016) to a 0. The following POKE
  does this:

    POKE 53265,PEEK(53265)AND 223: POKE 53270,PEEK(53270)AND 239

    As in standard (HI-RES) bit mapped mode, there is a one to one cor-
  respondence between the 8K section of memory being used for the display,
  and what is shown on the screen. However, the horizontal dots are two
  bits wide. Each 2 bits in the display memory area form a dot, which can
  have one of 4 colors."
