"What is the maximum addressable memory location that a sprite pointer can point to?","SPRITE POINTERS

    Even though each sprite takes only 63 bytes to define, one more byte
  is needed as a place holder at the end of each sprite. Each sprite, then,
  takes up 64 bytes. This makes it easy to calculate where in memory your
  sprite definition is, since 64 bytes is an even number and in binary it's
  an even power.
    Each of the 8 sprites has a byte associated with it called the SPRITE
  POINTER. The sprite pointers control where each sprite definition is lo-
  cated in memory. These 8 bytes are always located as the lost 8 bytes
  of the 1K chunk of screen memory. Normally, on the Commodore 64, this
  means they begin at location 2040 ($07F8 in HEX). However, if you move
  the screen, the location of your sprite pointers will also move.
    Each sprite pointer can hold a number from 0 to 255. This number points
  to the definition for that sprite. Since each sprite definition takes
  64 bytes, that means that the pointer can 'see' anywhere in the 16K
  block of memory that the VIC-II chip can access (since 256*64=16K)."
