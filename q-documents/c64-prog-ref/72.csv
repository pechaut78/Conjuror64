"What is the primary requirement for creating multi-colored sprites in a specific mode?","USING MULTI-COLOR:

    You can create multi-colored sprites although using multi-color mode
  requires that you use PAIRS of pixels instead of individual pixels in
  your sprite picture (in other words each colored 'dot' or 'block' in the
  sprite will consist of two pixels side by side). You have 4 colors to
  choose from: Sprite Color (chart,above), Multi-Color 1, Multi-Color 2 and
  'Background Color' (background is achieved by using zero settings which
  let the background color 'show through'). Consider one horizontal 8-pixel
  block in a sprite picture. The color of each PAIR of pixels is determined
  according to whether the left, right, or both pixels are solid."
