"What is the purpose of the OPEN statement in BASIC?","OUTPUT TO OTHER DEVICES

    It is often necessary to send output to devices other than the screen,
  like a cassette deck, printer, disk drive, or modem. The OPEN statement
  in BASIC creates a 'channel' to talk to one of these devices. Once the
  channel is OPEN, the PRINT# statement will send characters to that
  device.

  EXAMPLE of OPEN and PRINT# Statements:

    100 OPEN 4,4: PRINT# 4, 'WRITING ON PRINTER'
    110 OPEN 3,8,3,'0:DISK-FILE,S,W':PRINT#3,'SEND TO DISK'
    120 OPEN 1,1,1,'TAPE-FILE': PRINT#1,'WRITE ON TAPE'
    130 OPEN 2,2,0,CHR$(10):PRINT#2,'SEND TO MODEM'
    The OPEN statement is somewhat different for each device. The pa-
  rameters in the OPEN statement are shown in the table below for each
  device."
