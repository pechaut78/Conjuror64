"What is the condition required for accessing the device registers?","DATA BUS (DB7-DB0)

    The eight data bus pins are the bidirectional data port, controlled by
  /CS, RW, and Phase 0. The data bus can only be accessed while AEC and
  Phase 0 are high and /CS is low.

  CHIP SELECT (/CS)

    The chip select pin, /CS, is brought low to enable access to the device
  registers in conjunction with the address and RW pins. /CS low is recog-
  nized only while AEC and Phase 0 are high."
