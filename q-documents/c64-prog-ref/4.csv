"What are the different graphics display modes supported by the Commodore 64's 6567 Video Interface Chip (VIC-II chip)?","GRAPHICS OVERVIEW

  All of the graphics abilities of the Commodore 64 come from the 6567
  Video Interface Chip (also known as the VIC-II chip). This chip gives a
  variety of graphics modes, including a 40 column by 25 line text display,
  a 320 by 200 dot high resolution display, and SPRITES, small movable
  objects which make writing games simple. And if this weren't enough,
  many of the graphics modes can be mixed on the same screen. It is
  possible, for example, to define the top half of the screen to be in
  high resolution mode, while the bottom half is in text mode. And SPRITES
  will combine with anything! More on sprites later. First the other
  graphics modes.
