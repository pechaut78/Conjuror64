"What is the starting location of the VIC-II chip in the Commodore 64's memory?","GRAPHICS LOCATIONS

    Some general information first. There are 1000 possible locations on
  the Commodore 64 screen. Normally, the screen starts at location 1024
  ($0400 in HEXadecimal notation) and goes to location 2023. Each of
  these locations is 8 bits wide. This means that it can hold any integer
  number from 0 to 255. Connected with screen memory is a group of 1000
  locations called COLOR MEMORY or COLOR RAM. These start at location 55296
  ($D800 in HEX) and go up to 56295. Each of the color RAM locations is 4
  bits wide, which means that it can hold any integer number from 0 to 15.
  Since there are 16 possible colors that the Commodore 64 can use, this
  works out well.
    In addition, there are 256 different characters that can be displayed
  at any time. For normal screen display, each of the 1000 locations in
  screen memory contains a code number which tells the VIC-II chip which
  character to display at that screen location.
    The various graphics modes are selected by the 47 CONTROL registers in
  the VIC-II chip. Many of the graphics functions can be controlled by
  POKEing the correct value into one of the registers. The VIC-II chip is
  located starting at 53248 ($D000 in HEX) through 53294 ($D02E in HEX)."
