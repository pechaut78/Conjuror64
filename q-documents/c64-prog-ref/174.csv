"What are the five main activities performed by the KERNAL during its power-up sequence?","KERNAL POWER-UP ACTIVITIES

  1) On power-up, the KERNAL first resets the stack pointer, and clears
     decimal mode.
  2) The KERNAL then checks for the presence of an autostart ROM cartridge
     at location $8000 HEX (32768 decimal). If this is present, normal
     initialization is suspended, and control is transferred to the car-
     tridge code. If an autostart ROM is not present, normal system ini-
     tialization continues.
  3) Next, the KERNAL initializes all INPUT/OUTPUT devices. The serial bus
     is initialized. Both 6526 CIA chips are set to the proper values for
     keyboard scanning, and the 60-Hz timer is activated. The SID chip is
     cleared. The BASIC memory map is selected and the cassette motor is
     switched off.
  4) Next, the KERNAL performs a RAM test, setting the top and bottom of
     memory pointers. Also, page zero is initialized, and the tape buffer
     is set up.
       The RAM TEST routine is a nondestructive test starting at location
     $0300 and working upward. Once the test has found the first non-RAM
     location, the top of RAM has its pointer set. The bottom of memory is
     always set to $0800, and the screen setup is always set at $0400.
  5) Finally, the KERNAL performs these other activities. I/O vectors are
     set to default values. The indirect jump table in low memory is estab-
     lished. The screen is then cleared, and all screen editor variables
     reset. Then the indirect at $A000 is used to start BASIC."
