"What is the purpose of the 6566/6567 in the character display mode?","CHARACTER DISPLAY MODE

    In the character display mode, the 6566/6567 fetches CHARACTER POINTERs
  from the VIDEO MATRIX area of memory and translates the pointers to
  character dot location addresses in the 2048 byte CHARACTER BASE area of
  memory. The video matrix is comprised of 1000 consecutive locations in
  memory which each contain an eight-bit character pointer. The location of
  the video matrix within memory is defined by VM13-VM10 in register 24
  ($18) which are used as the 4 MSB of the video matrix address. The lower
  order 10 bits are provided by an internal counter (VC9-VC0) which steps
  through the 1000 character locations. Note that the 6566/6567 provides 14
  address outputs; therefore, additional system hardware may be required
  for complete system memory decodes.

    The eight-bit character pointer permits up to 256 different character
  definitions to be available simultaneously. Each character is an 8*8 dot
  matrix stored in the character base as eight consecutive bytes. The loca-
  tion of the character base is defined by CB13-CB11 also in register 24
  ($18) which are used for the 3 most significant bits (MSB) of the char-
  acter base address. The 11 lower order addresses are formed by the 8-bit
  character pointer from the video matrix (D7-D0) which selects a
  particular character, and a 3-bit raster counter (RC2-RC0) which selects
  one of the eight character bytes. The resulting characters are formatted
  as 25 rows of 40 characters each. In addition to the 8-bit character
  pointer, a 4-bit COLOR NYBBLE is associated with each video matrix
  location (the video matrix memory must be 12 bits wide) which defines one
  of sixteen colors for each character.

  STANDARD CHARACTER MODE (MCM = BMM = ECM = 0)

    In the standard character mode, the 8 sequential bytes from the
  character base are displayed directly on the 8 lines in each character
  region. A '0' bit causes the background #0 color (from register 33 ($21))
  to be displayed while the color selected by the color nybble (foreground)
  is displayed for a '1' bit (see Color Code Table).

                | CHARACTER |
     FUNCTION   |    BIT    |               COLOR DISPLAYED
  --------------+-----------+----------------------------------------------
    Background  |     0     |  Background #0 color
                |           |  (register 33 ($21)
    Foreground  |     1     |  Color selected by 4-bit color nybble


    Therefore, each character has a unique color determined by the 4-bit
  color nybble (1 of 16) and all characters share the common background
  color."
