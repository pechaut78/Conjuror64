"HWhat is the process for positioning a sprite beyond the 255th pixel across the screen in a Commodore 64 game?","POKEING AN X POSITION: The possible values of X are 0 to 255, counting
  from left to right. Values 0 to 23 place all or part of the sprite OUT OF
  THE VIEWING AREA off the left side of the screen... values 24 to 255
  place the sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA up to the 255th position (see next
  paragraph for settings beyond the 255th X position). To place the sprite
  at one of these positions, just type the X-POSITION POKE for the sprite
  you're using. For example, to POKE sprite I at the farthest left X
  position IN THE VIEWING AREA, type: POKE V+2,24.

    X VALUES BEYOND THE 255TH POSITION: To get beyond the 255th position
  across the screen, you need to make a SECOND POKE using the numbers in
  the 'RIGHT X' row of the chart (Figure 3-5). Normally, the horizontal (X)
  numbering would continue past the 255th position to 256, 257, etc., but
  because registers only contain 8 bits we must use a 'second register' to
  access the RIGHT SIDE of the screen and start our X numbering over again
  at 0. So to get beyond X position 255, you must POKE V+16 and a number
  (depending on the sprite). This gives you 65 additional X positions
  (renumbered from 0 to 65) in the viewing area on the RIGHT side of the
  viewing screen. (You can actually POKE the right side X value as high as
  255, which takes you off the right edge of the viewing screen.)

    POKEING A Y POSITION: The possible values of Y are 0 to 255, counting
  from top to bottom. Values 0 to 49 place all or part of the sprite OUT
  OF THE VIEWING AREA off the TOP of the screen. Values 50 to 229 place the
  sprite IN THE VIEWING AREA. Values 230 to 255 place all or part of the
  sprite OUT OF THE VIEWING AREA off the BOTTOM of the screen.

    Let's see how this X-Y positioning works, using sprite 1. Type this
  program:
start tok64 page159.prg
  10 print'{clear}':v=53248:pokev+21,2:poke2041,13
  20 fors=832to895:pokes,255:next:pokev+40,7
  30 pokev+2,24
  40 pokev+3,50
stop tok64

  This simple program establishes sprite 1 as a solid box and positions it
  at the upper left corner of the screen. Now change line 40 to read:

    40 POKE V+3,229

  This moves the sprite to the bottom left corner of the screen. Now let's
  test the RIGHT X LIMIT of the sprite. Change line 30 as shown:

    30 POKE V+2,255

  This moves the sprite to the RIGHT but reaches the RIGHT X LIMIT, which
  is 255. At this point, the 'most significant bit' in register 16 must be
  SET. In other words, you must type POKE V+ 16 and the number shown in the
  'RIGHT X' column in the X-Y POKE CHART above to RESTART the X position
  counter at the 256th pixel/position on the screen. Change line 30 as
  follows:

    30 POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 2:POKE V+2,0

  POKE V+16,2 sets the most significant bit of the X position for sprite 1
  and restarts it at the 256th pixel/position on the screen. POKE V+2,0
  displays the sprite at the NEW POSITION ZERO, which is now reset to the
  256th pixel.
    To get back to the left side of the screen, you must reset the most
  significant bit of the X position counter to 0 by typing (for sprite 1):

    POKE V+16, PEEK(V+16)AND 253

    TO SUMMARIZE how the X positioning works... POKE the X POSITION for any
  sprite with a number from 0 to 255. To access a position beyond the 255th
  position/pixel across the screen, you must use an additional POKE (V+16)
  which sets the most significant bit of the X position and start counting
  from 0 again at the 256th pixel across the screen.

  This POKE starts the X numbering over again from 0 at the 256th position
  (Example: POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)OR 1 and POKE V,1 must be included to place
  sprite 0 at the 257th pixel across the screen.) To get back to the left
  side X positions you have to TURN OFF the control setting by typing
  POKE V+16,PEEK(V+16)AND 254."
