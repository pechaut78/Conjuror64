"How can you create your own character sets on the Commodore 64?","PROGRAMMABLE CHARACTERS

    Since the characters are stored in ROM, it would seem that there is no
  way to change them for customizing characters. However, the memory
  location that tells the VIC-II chip where to find the characters is a
  programmable register which can be changed to point to many sections of
  memory. By changing the character memory pointer to point to RAM, the
  character set may be programmed for any need.
    If you want your character set to be located in RAM, there are a few
  VERY IMPORTANT things to take into account when you decide to actually
  program your own character sets. In addition, there are two other
  important points you must know to create your own special characters:

    1) It is an all or nothing process. Generally, if you use your own
       character set by telling the VIC-II chip to get the character
       information from the area you have prepared in RAM, the standard
     Commodore 64 characters are unavailable to you. To solve this, you
     must copy any letters, numbers, or standard Commodore 64 graphics you
     intend to use into your own character memory in RAM. You can pick and
     choose, take only the ones you want, and don't even have to keep them
     in order!

    2) Your character set takes memory space away from your BASIC program.
       Of course, with 38K available for a BASIC program, most applications
       won't have problems.
   WARNING: You must be careful to protect the character set from being  
   overwritten by your BASIC program, which also uses the RAM.           

    There are two locations in the Commodore 64 to start your character set
  that should NOT be used with BASIC: location 0 and location 2048. The
  first should not be used because the system stores important data on
  page 0. The second can't be used because that is where your BASIC program
  starts! However, there are 6 other starting positions for your custom
  character set.
    The best place to put your character set for use with BASIC while
  experimenting is beginning at 12288 ($3000 in HEX). This is done by
  POKEing the low 4 bits of location 53272 with 12."
