"What is the primary function of the program counter in a C64?","THE PROGRAM COUNTER

    This contains the address of the current machine language instruction
  being executed. Since the operating system is always 'RUN'ning in the
  Commodore 64 (or, for that matter, any computer), the program counter is
  always changing. It could only be stopped by halting the microprocessor
  in some way."
