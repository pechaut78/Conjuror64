"What is the primary function of the built-in dynamic RAM refresh controller in the 6566/6567 devices?","DYNAMIC RAM REFRESH

    A dynamic ram refresh controller is built in to the 6566/6567 devices.
  Five 8-bit row addresses are refreshed every raster line. This rate
  guarantees a maximum delay of 2.02 ms between the refresh of any single
  row address in a 128 refresh scheme. (The maximum delay is 3.66 ms in a
  256 address refresh scheme.) This refresh is totally transparent to the
  system, since the refresh occurs during Phase 1 of the system clock. The
  6567 generates both /RAS and /CAS which are normally connected directly
  to the dynamic rams. /RAS and /CAS are generated for every Phase 2 and
  every video data access (including refresh) so that external clock
  generation is not required.
