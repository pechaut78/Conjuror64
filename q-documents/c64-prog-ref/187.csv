"what is the purpose of the GETIN subroutine in kernal?","B-11. Function Name: GETIN


    Purpose: Get a character
    Call address: $FFE4 (hex) 65508 (decimal)
    Communication registers: A
    Preparatory routines: CHKIN, OPEN
    Error returns: See READST
    Stack requirements: 7+
    Registers affected: A (X, Y)

    Description: If the channel is the keyboard, this subroutine removes
  one character from the keyboard queue and returns it as an ASCII value in
  the accumulator. If the queue is empty, the value returned in the
  accumulator will be zero. Characters are put into the queue automatically
  by an interrupt driven keyboard scan routine which calls the SCNKEY
  routine. The keyboard buffer can hold up to ten characters. After the
  buffer is filled, additional characters are ignored until at least one
  character has been removed from the queue. If the channel is RS-232, then
  only the A register is used and a single character is returned. See
  READST to check validity. If the channel is serial, cassette, or screen,
  call BASIN routine.


  How to Use:

    1) Call this routine using a JSR instruction.
    2) Check for a zero in the accumulator (empty buffer).
    3) Process the data.


  EXAMPLE:

         ;WAIT FOR A CHARACTER
    WAIT JSR GETIN
         CMP #0
         BEQ WAIT"
