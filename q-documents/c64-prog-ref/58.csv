"What is the purpose of "crunching" a program in the context of sprite programming?","CRUNCHING YOUR SPRITE PROGRAMS                                        

                                                                         
   Here's a helpful 'crunching' tip: The program described above is      
   already short, but it can be made even shorter by 'crunching' it      
   smaller. In our example we list the key sprite settings on separate   
   program lines so you can see what's happening in the program. In      
   actual practice, a good programmer would probably write this program  
   as a TWO LINE PROGRAM... by 'crunching' it as follows:

  memory and run more efficiently, see the 'crunching guide' on Page 24."
