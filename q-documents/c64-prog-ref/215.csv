"What is the purpose of the VECTOR kernal function?","Function Name: VECTOR

    Purpose: Manage RAM vectors
    Call address: $FF8D (hex) 65421 (decimal)
    Communication registers: X, Y
    Preparatory routines: None
    Error returns: None
    Stack requirements: 2
    Registers affected: A, X, Y


    Description: This routine manages all system vector jump addresses
  stored in RAM. Calling this routine with the the accumulator carry bit
  set stores the current contents of the RAM vectors in a list pointed to
  by the X and Y registers. When this routine is called with the carry
  clear, the user list pointed to by the X and Y registers is transferred
  to the system RAM vectors. The RAM vectors are listed in the memory map.


 NOTE: This routine requires caution in its use. The best way to use it
 is to first read the entire vector contents into the user area, alter 
 the desired vectors, and then copy the contents back to the system    
 vectors.                                                              

  How to Use:

  READ THE SYSTEM RAM VECTORS

    1) Set the carry.
    2) Set the X and y registers to the address to put the vectors.
    3) Call this routine.

  LOAD THE SYSTEM RAM VECTORS

    1) Clear the carry bit.
    2) Set the X and Y registers to the address of the vector list in RAM
       that must be loaded.
    3) Call this routine.


  EXAMPLE:
    ;CHANGE THE INPUT ROUTINES TO NEW SYSTEM
    LDX #<USER
    LDY #>USER
    SEC
    JSR VECTOR      ;READ OLD VECTORS
    LDA #<MYINP     ;CHANGE INPUT
    STA USER+10
    LDA #>MYINP
    STA USER+11
    LDX #<USER
    LDY #>USER
    CLC
    JSR VECTOR      ;ALTER SYSTEM
    ...
    USER *=*+26"
