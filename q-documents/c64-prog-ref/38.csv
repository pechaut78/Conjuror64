"How do I unexpand a sprite in horizontal direction ?","To unexpand a sprite in the horizontal direction, the corresponding bit
  in the VIC-II control register at location 53277 ($D01D in HEX) must be
  turned OFF (set to a 0). The following POKE 'unexpands' a sprite in the
  X direction:

    POKE 53277,PEEK(53277)AND (255-2^SN)

  where SN is the sprite number from 0 to 7.
    To expand a sprite in the vertical direction, the corresponding bit in
  the VIC-II control register at location 53271 ($D017 in HEX) must be
  turned ON (set to a 1). The following POKE expands a sprite in the Y
  direction:

    POKE 53271,PEEK(53271)OR(2^SN)

  where SN is the sprite number from 0 to 7.
