"Explain the sid envelop generator?","SID: THE ENVELOPE GENERATOR

    The volume of a musical tone changes from the moment you first hear it,
  all the way through until it dies out and you can't hear it anymore. When
  a note is first struck, it rises from zero volume to its peak volume. The
  rate at which this happens is called the ATTACK. Then, it fails from the
  peak to some middle-ranged volume. The rate at which the fall of the note
  occurs is called the DECAY. The mid-ranged volume itself is called the
  SUSTAIN level. And finally, when the note stops playing, it fails from
  the SUSTAIN level to zero volume. The rate at which it fails is called
  the RELEASE. 


    Each of the items mentioned above give certain qualities and restric-
  tions to a note. The bounds are called parameters.
    The parameters ATTACK/DECAY/SUSTAIN/RELEASE and collectively called
  ADSR, can be controlled by your use of another set of locations in the
  sound generator chip. LOAD your first example program again. RUN it again
  and remember how it sounds."
