"How does the Commodore 64's screen memory map work and how can characters be displayed on the screen?","basic: SCREEN MEMORY MAP

  Since  the  computer's screen is capable of holding 1000 characters (40
columns by 25 lines)  there are 1000 memory locations set aside to handle
what  is placed on the screen.  The layout of the screen could be thought
of as a grid, with each square representing a memory location.
  And  since  each location in memory can contain a number from 0 to 255,
there  are  256  possible  values for each memory location.  These values
represent  the  different  characters  the  Commodore 64 can display (see
Appendix E).  By  POKEing  the  value  for a character in the appropriate
screen  memory  location,  that character will be displayed in the proper
position."
