"What is the purpose of the RUN command in a programming language?","basic: RUN

  This  command  causes  execution  of  a  program,  once  the program is
loaded  into  memory.  If  there  is  no  line  number following RUN, the
computer  will  start  with  the  lowest line number. If a line number is
designated, the program will start executing from the specified line.

  RUN               Starts program at lowest line number
  RUN 100           Starts execution at line 100
  RUN X             UNDEFINED STATEMENT ERROR. You must always specify an
                    actual line number, not a variable representation"
