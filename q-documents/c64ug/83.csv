"What is the purpose and syntax of the PRINT# statement in BASIC programming?","basic: PRINT#

  There are a few differences between this statement and PRINT. PRINT# is
followed by a number,  which refers to the device or data file previously
OPENed.  This number is followed by a comma and a list to be printed. The
comma and semicolon have the same effect as they do in PRINT. Please note
that some devices may not work with TAB and SPC.

  100 PRINT#1, 'DATA VALUES'; A%, B1, C$"
