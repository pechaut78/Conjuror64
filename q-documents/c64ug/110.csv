"What is the purpose and behavior of the VAL function in Basic programming?","basic: VAL(X$)

  This function converts X$ into a number, and is essentially the inverse
operation  from STR$.  The string is examined from the leftmost character
to  the  right,  for  as  many  characters  as are in recognizable number
format.

  10 X = VAL('123.456')             X = 123.456
  10 X = VAL('12A13B')              X = 12
  10 X = VAL('RIU017')              X = 0
  10 X = VAL('-1.23.45.67')         X = -1.23"
