"What is the syntax and behavior of the RND function in a programming language, including how to generate a random number between a specific range and how to reseed the random number generator?","basic: RND(X)  (random number)

  RND(X)  returns  a  random  number  in  the range 0-1. The first random
number  should  be  generated by the formula RND(-TI) to start things off
differently  every  time.  After  this,  X  should be a 1 or any positive
number.  If  X  is zero, the result will be the same random number as the
last one.
  A  negative  value  for  X  will  reseed  the generator. The use of the
same  negative  number  for  X  will  result  in  the  same  sequence  of
'random' numbers.
  The formula for generating a number between X and Y is:

  N = RND(1) * (Y-X) + X

where,
  Y is the upper limit,
  X is the lower range of numbers desired."
