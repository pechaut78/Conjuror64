"What is the purpose and syntax of the INPUT statement in a programming language?","basic: INPUT

  The  INPUT  statement  allows  the  program  to get data from the user,
assigning  that  data  to  a  variable.  The  program  will stop, print a
question  mark  (?)  on  the screen, and wait for the user to type in the
answer and hit RETURN.
  INPUT  is  followed  by  a  variable name, or a list of variable names,
separated by commas.  A message may be placed within quote marks,  before
the  list of variable names to be INPUT.  If more than one variable is to
be INPUT, they must be separated by commas when typed.
