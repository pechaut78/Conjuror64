"How do sprites work on the Commodore 64 and how are they controlled?","basic:  Sprite Creation

  Sprites are controlled by a separate picture-maker in the Commodore 64.
This  picture maker handles the video display.  It does all the hard work
of  creating  and  keeping  track  of  characters and graphics,  creating
colors, and moving around.
  This display circuit has 46 different 'ON/OFF' locations which act like
internal  memory  locations.  Each  of these locations breaks down into a
series of 8 blocks. And each block can either be 'ON' or 'OFF'. We'll get
into  more  detail  about this later.  By POKEing the appropriate decimal
value  in  the  proper  memory location you can control the formation and
movement of your sprite creations.
  In  addition  to accessing many of the picture making locations we will
also be using some of the Commodore 64's main memory to store information
(data) that defines the sprites. Finally, eight memory locations directly
after  the  screen memory will be used to tell the computer exactly which
memory area each sprite will get its data from."
