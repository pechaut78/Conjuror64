"What are the rules for assigning a name to a variable in BASIC?","basic: variable names: 

  In  assigning  a  name  to a variable there are a few things to keep in
mind.  First,  a  variable name can have one or two characters. The first
character  must  be  an  alphabetic  character  from  A to Z;  the second
character  can  be either alphabetic or numeric (in the range 0 to 9).  A
third character can be included to indicate the type of variable (integer
or text string), '%' or '$'.
  You can use variable names  having more than two alphabetic characters,
but  only the first two are recognized by the computer.  So PA and PARTNO
are the same and would refer to the same variable box.
  The  last  rule  for  variable names is simple:  they can't contain any
BASIC keywords  (reserved  words)  such as GOTO, RUN, etc.  Refer back to
Appendix D for a complete list of BASIC reserved words."
