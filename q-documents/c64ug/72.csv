"What is the syntax and functionality of the FOR loop statement in a programming language?","basic: FOR ... TO ... STEP

  This statement works with the NEXT statement to repeat a section of the
program a set number of times. The format is:

  FOR (Var. Name)=(Start of Count) TO (End of Count) STEP (Count By)

  The  loop  variable  will  be  added  to  or subtracted from during the
program.  Without any STEP specified,  STEP is assumed to be 1. The start
count and end count are the limits to the value of the loop variable.

  10 FOR L = 1 to 10 STEP .1
  20 PRINT L
  30 NEXT L

  The end of the loop value may be followed by the word STEP  and another
number or variable.  In this case, the value following STEP is added each
time instead of 1. This allows you to count backwards, or by fractions."
