"What is the purpose of the CONT command in a program?","basic: CONT (Continue)

  This command is used to restart the execution of a  program  which  has
been stopped by either using the <STOP> key, a STOP statement,  or an END
statement within the program. The program will restart at the exact place
from where it left off.
  CONT will not work if you have changed or added lines  to  the  program
(or even just moved the cursor),  or if the  program  halted  due  to  an
error, or if you caused an error before trying to restart the program. In
these cases you will get a CAN'T CONTINUE ERROR."
