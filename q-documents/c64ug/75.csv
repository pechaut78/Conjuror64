"What are the differences and uses of the GOSUB and GOTO statements in programming?","basic: GOSUB

  This statement is similar to GOTO,  except the computer remembers which
program line it last executed before the GOSUB. When a line with a RETURN
statement  is  encountered,  the  program  jumps  back  to  the statement
immediately following the GOSUB.  This is useful if there is a routine in
your program that occurs in several parts of the program.
Instead of typing the routine over and over, execute GOSUBs each time the
routine is needed.

  20 GOSUB 800

GOTO or GO TO

  When a statement with the GOTO command is reached,  the next line to be
executed will be the one with the line number following the word GOTO."
