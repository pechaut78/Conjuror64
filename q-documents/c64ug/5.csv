"What are the optional connections available on the Commodore 64 and how can they be utilized?","c64 Optional Connections

  Since the Commodore 64 furnishes a channel of high fidelity sound,  you
may wish to play it through a quality amplifier to realize the best sound
possible.   In addition,  the  Commodore  64  also  provides  a  standard
'composite' video signal, which can be fed into a television monitor.
  These  options  are made possible by the audio/video output jack on the
rear panel  of the Commodore 64.  The easiest way to gain access to these
signals is by using a standard 5-Pin DIN audio cable (not supplied). This
cable connects directly to the audio/video connector on the computer. Two
of  the  four pins on the opposite end of the cable contain the audio and
video signals.  Optionally,  you can construct your own cable,  using the
pinouts shown in Appendix I as a guide.
  Normally,  the  BLACK  connector  of  the  DIN cable supplies the AUDIO
signal.  This  plug  may  be  connected  to  the  AUXILIARY  input  of an
amplifier,  or the AUDIO IN connector of a monitor or other video system,
such as a video cassette recorder (VCR).
  The  WHITE  or  RED connector usually supplies the direct VIDEO signal.
This  plug is connected to the VIDEO IN connector of the monitor or video
input section of some other video system, such as a VCR.
  Depending  on  the manufacturer of your DIN cable,  the color coding of
the plugs may be different.  Use the pinouts shown in Appendix I to match
up the proper plugs  if you don't get an audio or video signal  using the
suggested connections."
