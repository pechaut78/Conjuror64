"What are the registers and procedures involved in creating and moving sprites in a graphics program?","basic: Sprites

 you need to know what
picture making locations control the functions you need. These locations,
called registers, could be illustrated in this manner:

  Register(s)   Description

   0            X coordinate of sprite 0
   1            Y coordinate of sprite 0
   2 - 15       Paired like 0 and 1 for sprites 1-7
  16            Most Significant Bit -- X coordinate
  21            Sprite appear: 1 = appear, 0 = disappear
  29            Expand sprite in 'X' Direction
  23            Expand sprite in 'Y' Direction
  39-46         Sprite 0-7 color

  In  addition  to  this  information you need to know from which 64 byte
section sprites will get their data (1 byte is used).
  This data is handled by 8 locations directly after screen memory:

        | 2040 | 2041 | 2042 | 2043 | 2044 | 2045 | 2046 | 2047 |
     SPRITE 0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7

  Now let's outline the exact procedure to get things moving  and finally
write a program.
  There  are  only a few things necessary to actually create  and move an
object.

  1. Make the proper sprite(s) appear on the screen by POKEing into
     location 21 a 1 for the bit which turns on the sprite.
  2. Set sprite pointer (locations 2040-2047) to where sprite data should
     be read from.
  3. POKE actual data into memory.
  4. Through a loop, update X and Y coordinates to move sprite around.
  5. You can, optionally, expand the object, change colors,  or perform a
     variety  of  special  functions.  Using  location  29 to expand your
     sprite in the 'X' direction and location 23 in the 'Y' direction."
