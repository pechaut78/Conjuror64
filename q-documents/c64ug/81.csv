"What is the purpose and syntax of the OPEN statement in Commodore 64 BASIC programming?","basic: OPEN

  Then  OPEN  statement allows the Commodore 64 to access devices such as
the cassette recorder and disk for data,  a printer,  or even the screen.
OPEN  is followed by a number (0-255),  to which all following statements
will  refer.  There is usually a second number after the first,  which is
the device number.
  The device numbers are:

  0   Screen
  1   Cassette
  4   Printer
  8   Disk

  Following the device number may be a third number, separated again by a
third number, separated again by a comma, which is the secondary address.
In the case of the cassette,  this is 0 for read,  1 for write, and 2 for
write with end-of-tape marker.
  In the case of the disk,  the number refers to the buffer,  or channel,
number.  In  the  printer,  the  secondary address controls features like
expanded printing. See the Commodore 64 Programmer's Reference Manual for
more details.
