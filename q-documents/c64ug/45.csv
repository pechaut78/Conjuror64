"What is the purpose and functionality of the GET command in BASIC programming?","basic:  GET

  GET  allows  you  to  input  one  character at a time from the keyboard
without  hitting  <RETURN>.  This  really  speeds  entering  data in many
applications.  Whatever  key  is hit is assigned variable to the variable
you specify with GET.
  The following routine illustrates how GET works:

  NEW

   1 PRINT '{CLR/HOME}'
  10 GET A$: IF A$ = '' THEN 10
  20 PRINT A$;        
  30 GOTO 10          

If you RUN the program,  the screen will clear  and each time you hit a
key, will  print  it  on  the  display,  and  then GET another
character. It is important to note that the character entered will not be
displayed  unless you specifically PRINT it to the screen,  as we've done
here."
