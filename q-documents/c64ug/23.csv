"What are the steps to reset the Commodore 64 screen and text color to their default settings after running a color test?","C64 Rinitialize

<SHIFT> and <CLR/HOME>.  The screen should clear and the cursor
will  be  positioned  in  the  'home' spot (upper left-hand corner of the
screen).
  Now, simultaneously hold <C=> and the <7> key. This sets the text color
back to light blue.  There is one more step needed to get everything back
to normal. Hold <CTRL> and <0> (Zero not Oh!). This sets the display mode
back  to  normal.  If  you  remember,  we turned REVERSE type on with the
<CTRL><9> to create the color bars (the color bars were actually reversed
spaces).  If  we were in the normal text mode during the color test,  the
cursor would have moved, but just left blank spaces."
