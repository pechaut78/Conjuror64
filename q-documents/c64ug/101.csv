"What are the definitions and behaviors of the SIN(X), SQR(X), and TAN(X) functions?","basic: SIN(X)  (sine)

  SIN(X) is the trigonometric sine function.  The result will be the sine
of X, where X is an angle in radians.

SQR(X)  (square root)

  This  function will return the square root of X,  where X is a positive
number or 0. If X is negative, an ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR results.

TAN(X)  (tangent)

  The result will be the tangent of X, where X is an angle in radians."
