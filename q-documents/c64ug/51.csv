"What is the formula to calculate the memory location on the Commodore 64 screen, and how would you use it to determine the memory location of a ball bouncing on the screen at column 20, row 12?","basic:   Screen  memory  in  the Commodore 64 normally begins at memory location
1024,  and ends at location 2023.  Location 1024 is the upper left corner
of the screen. Location 1025 is the position of the next character to the
right  of that,  and so on down the row.  Location 1063 is the right-most
position of the first row. The next location following the last character
on a row is the first character on the next row down.

  Now,  let's  say that you're controlling a ball bouncing on the screen.
The ball is in the middle of the screen,  column 20, row 12.  The formula
for calculation of the memory location on the screen is:

  POINT = 1024 + X + 40 * Y

where X is the column and Y is the row.
  Therefore, the memory location of the ball is:
  POKE 1524, 81
  POKE 55796, 1"
