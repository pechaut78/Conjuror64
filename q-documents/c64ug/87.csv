"What happens when a program encounters a RETURN statement, and what error occurs if no GOSUB was previously issued?","basic: RETURN

  This  statement  is  always  used  in conjunction with GOSUB.  When the
program  encounters  a  RETURN,  it  will go to the statement immediately
following the GOSUB command.  If no GOSUB was previously issued, a RETURN
WITHOUT GOSUB ERROR will occur."
