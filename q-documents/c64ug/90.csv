"What is the purpose and syntax of the WAIT command in a programming language?","basic: WAIT

  WAIT  is  used  to  halt  the  program  until  the contents of a memory
location changes in a specific way. WAIT is followed by a memory location
(X) and up to two variables. The format is:

  WAIT X,Y,Z

  The  contents  of the memory location are first exclusive-ORed with the
third  number,  if  present,  and  then  logically  ANDed with the second
number.  If  the  result  is  zero,  the program goes back to that memory
location  and  checks  again.  When  the  result  is nonzero, the program
continues with the next statement."
