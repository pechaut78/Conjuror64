"What is the purpose and syntax of the GET statement in BASIC programming?","basic: GET

  The  GET  statement  allows  you  to  get  data from the keyboard,  one
character at a time. When GET is executed, the character that is typed is
assigned to the variable.  If no character is typed,  then a null (empty)
character is assigned.
  GET  is  followed by a variable name,  usually a string variable.  If a
numeric  variable  was  used and a nonnumeric key depressed,  the program
would halt with an error message.  The GET statement may be placed into a
loop,  checking for  any result.  This loop will continue  until a key is
hit.

  10 GET A$: IF  A$ = ''  THEN 10"
