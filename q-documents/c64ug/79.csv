"What is the purpose and syntax of the NEXT statement in a FOR loop?","basic: NEXT

  NEXT  is  always  used in conjunction with the FOR statement.  When the
program  reaches a NEXT statement,  it checks the FOR statement to see if
the limit of the loop has been reached.  If the loop is not finished, the
loop  variable  is increased by the specified STEP value.  If the loop is
finished,  execution  proceeds  with  the  statement following NEXT.
  NEXT  may  be  followed by a variable name,  or list of variable names,
separated by commas.  If there are no names listed, the last loop started
is the one being completed. If variables are given, they are completed in
order from left to right.
