"What is the function of the <RUN/STOP> key in a BASIC program, and how can it be used in shifted mode?","<RUN/STOP> key

  Normally,  depressing the <RUN/STOP>  key  will stop the execution of a
BASIC program. It signals the computer to STOP doing something. Using the
<RUN/STOP> key in the shifted mode will allow you to automatically load a
program from tape."
