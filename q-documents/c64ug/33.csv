"What is the purpose of the PRINT command in BASIC programming, and how can it be used for calculations and displaying results?","PRINT and Calculations

  Now  that  you've  gotten  through  a  couple  of  the  more  difficult
operations  you need  in order to keep the programs you like,  lets start
making some programs for you to save.
  Try typing the following exactly as shown:

  PRINT 'COMMODORE 64'     <----- Type this line and hit <RETURN>
  COMMODORE 64            <------ Computer typed

  READY.
  _

  If  you  make  a  typing  mistake,  use the <INST/DEL> key to erase the
character  immediately  to the left of the cursor. You can delete as many
characters as necessary.
  Let's  see  what  went on in the example above.  First,  you instructed
(commanded) the computer to PRINT whatever was inside the quote marks. By
hitting  <RETURN>  you  told  the computer to do  what you instructed and
COMMODORE 64 was printed on the screen.
  When you use the PRINT statement in this form,  whatever is enclosed in
quotes is printed exactly as you typed it.
  If the computer responded with:

  ?SYNTAX ERROR

ask yourself if you made a mistake in typing,  or forgot the quote marks.
The  computer  is  precise  and  expects  instructions  to  be given in a
specific form.
  But don't get worried; just remember to enter things as we present them
in the examples and you'll get along great with the Commodore 64.
  Remember, you can't hurt the computer by typing on it, and the best way
to learn BASIC is to try different things and see what happens.
  PRINT  is  one  of  the  most useful and powerful commands in the BASIC
language.  With  it,  you  can  display  just  about  anything  you wish,
including graphics and results of computations.
  For example,  try the following.  Clear the screen  by holding down the
<SHIFT> key  and  <CLR/HOME> key and type (be sure to use the '1' key for
one, not a letter 'I'):

  PRINT 12 + 12            
  24                      

  READY.

  What you've discovered is  that the Commodore 64 is a calculator in its
basic form.  The result of '24' was calculated and printed automatically.
In  fact,  you can also perform  subtraction,  multiplication,  division,
exponentiation, and  advanced  math  functions such as calculating square
roots, etc. And you're not limited to a single calculation on a line, but
more on that later.
  Note  that in the above form,  PRINT behaved differently from the first
example.  In  this  case,  a value or result of a calculation is printed,
rather  than  the  exact message you entered because the quote marks were
omitted."
