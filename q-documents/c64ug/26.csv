"What are the steps to load a game cartridge on a Commodore 64 computer?","CARTRIDGES: The Commodore 64 computer has a line of programs and games
on cartridge.  The programs offer a wide variety of business and personal
applications  and  the  games  are  just  like real arcade games  --  not
imitations. To load these games, first turn on your TV set. Next turn OFF
your  Commodore 64.  YOU MUST TURN OFF YOUR COMMODORE 64 BEFORE INSERTING
OR  REMOVING  CARTRIDGES  OR  YOU  MAY  DAMAGE  THE CARTRIDGE AND/OR YOUR
COMMODORE 64! Third insert the cartridge.  Now turn your Commodore 64 on.
Finally  type  the  appropriate START key as is listed on the instruction
sheet that comes with each game."
