"What is the function of the key on a keyboard that allows you to switch between uppercase and lowercase characters, as well as access graphic characters and special functions?","<SHIFT> key

  The <SHIFT> key works like that on a standard typewriter. Many keys are
capable of displaying two letters or symbols  and two graphic characters.
In  the  'upper/lower case' mode the <SHIFT> key gives you standard upper
case  characters.  In the 'upper case/graphic' mode  the <SHIFT> key will
display the graphic character on the right hand side of the front part of
the key.
  In the case of special YELLOW function keys,  the <SHIFT> key will give
you the function marked on the front of the key."
