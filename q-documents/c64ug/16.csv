"What is the function of the <INST/DEL> key in a text editor?","<INST/DEL> key

  If  you  hit  the  <INST/DEL>  key,  the cursor will move back a space,
erasing  (DELeting)  the  previous  character you typed. If you're in the
middle of a line, the character to the left is deleted and the characters
to the right automatically move together to close up the space.
  A <SHIFT>ed <INST/DEL> allows you to INSerT information on a line.  For
example,  if you noticed a typing mistake  in the beginning of a line  --
perhaps you left out part of the name  -- you could use the <CRSR> key to
move back to the error  and then hit <INST/DEL>  to insert a space.  Then
just type in the missing later."
