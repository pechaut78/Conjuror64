"What is the function of the basic function INT(X) in a programming language?","basic: INT(X)

  Returns the truncated value of X, that is,  with all the decimal places
to the right of the decimal point removed. The result will always be less
than, or equal to, X. Thus, any negative numbers with decimal places will
become the integer less than their current value."
