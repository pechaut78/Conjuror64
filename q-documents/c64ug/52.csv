"What is the memory map structure used to store character and color information on the Commodore 64's screen?","COLOR MEMORY MAP

For every spot on the Commodore 64's
screen  there are two memory locations,  one for the character code,  and
the  other  for  the color code.  The color memory map begins at location
55296 (top left-hand  corner),  and continues on for 1000 locations.  The
same color codes, from 0-15, that we used to change border and background
colors can be used here to directly change character colors."
