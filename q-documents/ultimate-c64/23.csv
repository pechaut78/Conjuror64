"What are the memory layout and addressing capabilities of the VIC chip in a Commodore 64 computer?","Memory Layout
The VIC can address 16 KB at a time. All VIC data
structures can be stored anywhere in these 16 KB, but
they have to be aligned to their size.
• The screen RAM is $0400 bytes in size and can be
at $0000, $0400, ...
• The character set is $0800 bytes, and can be at
$0000, $0800, ...
• The bitmap is $2000 bytes and can be at $0000 or
$2000.
• Sprites are $40 bytes, and can be at $0000,
$0040, ...
Two GPIO pins of the second 6526 CIA are connected
to bits 6 and 7 of RAM when the VIC accesses it. By
changing the lower 2 bits of $DD02, the VIC can be
switched between banks $0000-$3FFF (11), $4000-
$7FFF (10), $8000-$BFFF (01) and $C000-$FFFF
(00).
If the VIC is set to banks $0000 or $8000, then the
two built-in character sets shadow RAM in the area of
$1000-$1FFF. This means that the built-in character
set can be used on those banks without occupying
RAM, but it also means that the area from $1000-
$1FFF cannot be used for bitmap, screen RAM or
sprite data either.
For timing reasons, color information is not taken
from main RAM, but from a dedicated Color RAM.
These $0400 half-bytes are accessible to the C64 at
$D800-$DBFF and can not be bank switched."
