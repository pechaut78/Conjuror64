"What is the IEC bus and how does it work on Commodore computers?","IEC Bus
The IEC bus is a serial version of the IEEE-488 bus
used on the PET. Devices on the IEC bus are daisychained, and are all connected to the same three
lines: ATN (attention), clock and data. IEC has a single bus master, which is the computer. It is the only
device to ever raise ATN, while every device can output to clock and data, depending on the state of the
bus.
If the computer raises ATN, every device on the bus
listens for the 4 bit device number and compares it
with its own. The protocol on who sends and who receives is determined by the computer sending TALK/
UNTALK and LISTEN/UNLISTEN requests, quick is an ATN sequence, followed by one of the four commands.
While KERNAL exports the interface at this level, it
also allows high-level open, close, read and write operations on the IEC bus, as well as load and save operations. The BASIC LOAD and SAVE commands are
directly hooked up to this interface.
The IEC bus was designed for the serial shift register
in the VIA (Versatile Interface Adapter) of the VIC-20
and its disk drive, but it turned out that the VIA had a
bug that made the shift register unusable, so the IEC
protocol had to be implemented in software. While
the C64 has CIAs, in which the bug has been fixed,
the 1541 still used VIAs. It wasn't until the C128 (in its
native mode only) that the computer could talk to the
floppy drive (Commodore 1570/1571/1581) in its intended speed."
