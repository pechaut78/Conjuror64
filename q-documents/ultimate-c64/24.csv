"What are the key aspects of the VIC's timing that are essential to understand for advanced programming and achieving cycle-exact timing in assembly code?","Timing
For advanced VIC programming, it is necessary to not
just set up a certain mode and have the VIC display it,
but to reprogram the VIC while it is drawing the picture. For this, it is necessary, to understand its timing.
While the pixels within the screen area are 320 by
200, the VIC actively draws pixels in the border color
outside of this area, which (on PAL) is 403x284 pixels. Analog TV standards specify an H blank area at
the end of every line, and V blank area at the end of
every screen. So counting this timing as pixels, this
gives an absolute resolution of 504x312 pixels. The
interesting and very useful connection about the pixel
clock and the system clocks is that an 8 pixel character is drawn every system clock cycle, i.e. about 1 million times a second. The 504 horizontal pixels therefore mean that a line is drawn on the screen every 63
cycles. With this information, it is possible to do
cycle-exact timing of assembly code to switch a VIC
register at an 8 pixel granularity.
Further timing details (badlines, sprite timing), as
well as the application of this information to do tricks
like FLD, FLI and AGSP would go beyond the scope
of this article."
