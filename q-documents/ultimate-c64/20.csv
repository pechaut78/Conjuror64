"How does the VIC chip handle graphics modes, including hi-res and multi-color bitmap modes, in terms of resolution, pixel encoding, and color management?","Bitmap Mode
In hi-res graphics mode, the VIC supports a resolution of 320x200, which uses the same pixel frequency
as 40x25 character mode (40*8=320, 25*8=200).
The bitmap can reside at $0000 or $2000, and the
VIC reads one byte for 8 pixels. But hi-res mode does
not only support monochrome graphics: The foreground and background colors of each 8x8 tile are
taken from the high and low nibble of screen RAM,
which would otherwise be unused. Color RAM is not
used in this mode.
The encoding of the bitmap is identical to the encoding of a character set, making it a non-linear framebuffer: The first eight bytes of the bitmap represent
the pixels in the tile at character position (0,0), the
second eight bytes represent the tile at character position (1,0), which is pixel position (8,0), and so on.
This layout makes pixel addressing in software
slower.
In Multi-Color Bitmap Mode, the horizontal resolution is halved to 160x200, and pixels are twice the
width. Every set of two bits in the encodes one of four
colors per tile: 00 takes it from the global background
register ($D021), 01 and 10 take it from the upper
and lower nibble of screen RAM, respectively, and 11
takes it from Color RAM."
