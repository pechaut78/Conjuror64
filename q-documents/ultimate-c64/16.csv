"What was the graphical user interface-based operating system released by Berkeley Softworks in 1986 for the Commodore 64?","GEOS
While KERNAL is a minimal character-based operating system in ROM, there is also a disk-based operating system with a graphical user interface for the C64.
GEOS was released by Berkeley Softworks in 1986
and Commodore bundled it with the C64 for some
time. The GUI, which can be controlled by a joystick
or a mouse, runs in 320x200 graphics mode and resembles early versions of MacOS. GEOS is a 16 KB
library that includes an optimized disk interface
(faster, support for timstamps, icons and multi-fork
”VLIR” files), library code for drawing to the screen,
high level UI primitives for menus, buttons and dialog boxes (with callbacks) and a simple memory
swapping facility. Furthermore GEOS allows input
and printer driver plugins, as well as proportional
fonts in different sizes. Internally, GEOS has a jump
table to its library routines that consists of about 150
entries.
GEOS came with applications like GeoPaint and GeoWrite; Berkeley Softworks themselves offered solutions like GeoPublish and GeoCalc, and more software was available from third parties.
GEOS' only requirement is a 1541 disk drive, but a
3.5' 1581 drive, a RAM extension or one of the later
hard drives helped speed it up a lot."
