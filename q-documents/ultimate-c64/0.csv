"What is the history of the Commodore 64, including its development, features, and impact on the computer market?","History of the C64
Commodore Business Machines was founded in 1962
by Jack Tramiel. The company specialized on electronic calculators, and in 1976, Commodore bought the chip manufacturer MOS Technology and decided to have Chuck Peddle from MOS evolve their KIM-1 computer kit (a design that demos their new MOS 6502 8 bit CPU) into the Commodore PET series: computers with built-in monitors for the home, school and small business market that ended up competing with devices from Atari and Apple. In 1981, Commodore introduced the VIC-20, a 5 KB stripped down monitorless computer-in-thekeyboard design based on the PET for the home computer market. This was followed by the (incompatible) higher-end Commodore 64 in 1982 that included more PET features, came with 64 KB of RAM (an immense amount compared to the rest of the market) and was very aggressively priced at US$595 beating the competition by a factor of two. This was made possible by designing and building most of the system in-house. Although some features of the C64 were taken from the PET models of the time, it had to be connected to a TV set, which only made 40 columns of text possible (as opposed to 80 columns on the PET). Also, the BASIC 4.0 codebase was stripped down to the old 2.0 feature set to make it fit into 8 KB.
In the beginning, the C64 did well in the competition. The superior but compatible C128 from 1985 did well, too, but was never more popular than the C64, which continued to be sold. The direct successor to the lowend VIC-20, the 1984 Plus/4 and its siblings, the C16 and the C116, failed, mostly because they were incompatible with the C64, which at that time already had a remarkable software library. A few years after the introduction, the C64 was still offered as a low-end alternative to the Commodore Amiga, and while it became less popular in the USA,
it gained more and more popularity in Europe. In the early 90s, when manufacturing costs of a C64 were as low as $25, it gained a second life in Eastern Europe.
Production did not end until the liquidation of Commodore in 1994. According to the 1993 Annual Report, 17 million C64 had been produced in by then, as
well as 4.5 million C128."
