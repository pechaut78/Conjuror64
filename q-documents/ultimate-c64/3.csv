"What is the memory mapping of the Commodore 64's 6510 CPU, including the address ranges for RAM, ROM, I/O devices, and other components?","Address Space
The 8 bit C64 design has a 16 bit address bus, allowing the CPU to address 64 KB of memory. Since the
C64 has 64 KB of RAM, filling the complete address
space, ROM and I/O chips are mapped into regions of
the address space that are shared with RAM: The
CPU can switch these regions between RAM and a
second or third mapping. These regions are as follows:
• $0000-$9FFF: RAM
• $A000-$BFFF: RAM or BASIC ROM
• $C000-$CFFF: RAM
• $D000-$DFFF: RAM or memory mapped I/O
chips or character ROM
• $E000-$FFFF: RAM or KERNAL ROM
In contrast to CPUs like the Z80 and the 8086, and
like most modern CPUs, I/O devices are memory
mapped on the C64's 6510 CPU. The mapping is as
follows:
• $D000-$D3FF: VIC video controller
• $D400-$D7FF: SID sound controller
• $D800-$DBFF: Color RAM
• $DC00-$DCFF: CIA 1 I/O controller
• $DD00-$DDFF: CIA 2 I/O controller
• $DE00-$DFFF: for extensions on the expansion
port"
