"What is the history and features of Microsoft BASIC and its variations, including Commodore BASIC, on early home computers?","BASIC
Microsoft had a strong position in the market for
(mostly ROM) BASIC interpreters in 8080-based
home computers when the MOS 6502 was released in
1975, so they rewrote their interpreter in 6502 assembly. Microsoft BASIC was pure 6502 code with a
minimal character I/O interface to the machine's
”monitor”, i.e. I/O library.
Commodore decided to license the interpreter for the
1977 PET and extended it slightly to interface with
their disk and tape libraries. Commodore BASIC was
very buggy, so they went back to Microsoft for an update, which, with the Commodore changes re-applied,
shipped in newer PETs as BASIC V2. For version 4,
Commodore added several extensions, both language
constructs as well as support for graphics and sound.
Being a low-end machine, Commodore took the bugfixed BASIC V4 codebase and removed all features
after V2, making it independent of the machine's
graphics and sound features again, and fitting it back
into 8 KB, and shipped this version on the VIC-20.
The Commodore 64 got the exact same version, except that it runs at a different memory address
($A000-$BFFF).
Microsoft BASIC is a line-based editor, that is, lines
can be shown with the LIST command, and they can
be modified by re-typing them. This integrates nicely
with the KERNAL screen editor: The cursor can be
moved up to LISTed lines, the lines can be modified,
and when RETURN is pressed, the whole line is fed
into BASIC again.

A nice feature of this and later versions of Commodore BASIC is the fact that all important parts, like
the tokenizer, the detokenizer and the interpreter
loop jump over a jump table in RAM before they do
their work, allowing the user to extend BASIC arbitrarily. The most well-known BASIC extension is Simons' BASIC, a cartridge that maps 8 KB of extra
ROM at $8000-$9FFF."
