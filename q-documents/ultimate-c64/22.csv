"What are the characteristics and capabilities of the VIC's hardware sprites (MOBs) on the Commodore 64?","Sprites
The VIC has eight hardware sprites (also called
MOBs, movable objects). Each sprite is 24x21 pixels,
which is encoded in 63 bytes. Set bits will be drawn in
the sprite's individual foreground color, and cleared
bits will be transparent. The index to the sprite's bitmap data in memory is an 8 bit value that is read
from the last 8 bytes of screen RAM - since the screen
is only 1000 characters, the last 24 characters of the
$0400=1024 bytes area would otherwise be unused.
There is also a multicolor mode for sprites, which
makes pixels twice as wide and decreases the horizontal resolution to 12 pixels. In this mode, 00 is still
transparent, and 10 encodes the sprite's individual
color. The codes 01 and 11 take the color out of the
sprite multicolor registers ($D025 and $D026),
which are shared among all sprites.
Sprites can be positioned at arbitrary pixel positions
on the screen, and overlap. In this case, sprites with
lower numbers have priority over sprites with higher
numbers. Each sprite can either be shown in front or
behind background pixels. Sprites can be X- and Yexpanded by a factor of two, and collision of two
sprites or of a sprite and background pixels is detected by hardware: Whenever two non-transparent
sprite pixels are drawn at the same position on the
screen, they have collided. Whenever a nonbackground pixel is drawn by the character generator
at the same position where a non-background pixel of
a sprite is draw, the sprite has collided with the background. An exception from this rule is the 01 code in
the character data, which also counts as background.
This way, a background picture can be constructed
that does not cause collisions in certain areas. In
practice, most newer games do not use the hardware
functionality, but instead test for overlapping sprite
bounding boxes in software."
