"What are the features and uses of the 6526 CIA (Complex Interface Adapter) in the Commodore 64 computer?","6526 CIA
The C64 has two identical 6526 CIAs (Complex Interface Adapter) that are mostly used for I/O. One CIA
features 16 general purpose I/O pins (8 bit port A and
8 bit port B) that can be used either as an input or an
output, two programmable timers and a real-timeclock.
The timers have 16 bit counters and count down by
one either on each clock cycle, or on an external
event, or on a timer A underflow (in the case of timer
B). This allows concatenating the timers to one 32 bit
timer. On an underflow, the CIA can be programmed
to cause an IRQ or to send data through a serial shift
register. The CIA also supports receiving data
through a shift register.
The real-time-clock has a resolution of 1/10 of seconds and supports generating interrupts at a certain
time.
CIA 1 is hooked up to the keyboard and the joystick
ports. Since the keyboard consists of 64 keys (plus
SHIFT LOCK, which is parallel to the left SHIFT key,
and RESTORE, which is directly connected to the
CPU's NMI line), these can be laid out in a 8x8 matrix
of lines, key presses connecting the intersections. One
side of the matrix is connected to port A (output), and
the perpendicular side is connected to port B (input).
The keyboard driver can now write the values of $01,
$02, $04 etc. in port A and test the input of port B to
see which keys are pressed. The two joysticks are
connected in parallel to port A and port B, so they can
cause spurious keyboard events.
CIA 2 is hooked up to the IEC bus, and I/O lines control the VIC bank. The rest is exposed on the user
port, and can be used for RS-232.
KERNAL uses CIA 1 for the 50 Hz system timer, but,
apart from the ports, doesn't use any of the extra features of either CIA."
