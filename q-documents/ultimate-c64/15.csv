"What is the role and functionality of the KERNAL I/O library in Commodore 8-bit systems, particularly in the Commodore 64?","KERNAL
The C64 has an 8 KB I/O library at $E000-$FFFF
which is utilized by BASIC, but is intended to be used
by other applications as well. All Commodore 8 bit
systems have a standardized library call interface in
the form of jump tables at the very top of memory
that call into machine-specific functions for I/O.
KERNAL is started form the RESET vector, initializes
the machine, sets up an interrupt service routine that
handles the keyboard, animates the cursor and does
the real time clock. The C64 has a hardware clock in
each of the CIA chips, but KERNAL has not been updated to use this feature since the VIC-20.
KERNAL provides an abstract character I/O interface
to a number of devices. All devices support open,
read, write and close. The open call takes three parameters: The logical file number (there is a maximum of 16 channels), the device number and the secondary address. There are 16 device numbers statically assigned to the devices. The 8 bit secondary address can signal something to the device, like speed or
an operation mode. Some devices (tape and IEC)
support an optional filename.
Device 0 is the keyboard. While KERNAL exports raw
key presses, the keyboard can also be accessed
through character I/O, which will go through the
screen editor and replay all characters on the screen
that are in the line of the cursor, regardless of
whether the user typed them or they had been there
before.
Device 1 is the tape drive. KERNAL reads and writes
blocks of data at a time and buffers them for character I/O.
Device 2 is RS-232. KERNAL contains a very sophisticated (but rarely used) software RS-232 implementation that supports up to 2400 baud.
Device 3 is the screen. KERNAL interprets special
codes, manages the cursor position and handles
scrolling.
Devices 4 to 15 will be directed to the IEC bus. By
convention, devices 4 to 7 are printers and plotters,
and devices 8 to 15 are floppy or hard disks.
KERNAL allows interacting with the IEC bus manually by sending TALK and LISTEN requests to the
bus."
