"How many cycles do different types of instructions take on a 6502 processor?","Cycle Counting
It is quite straightforward to find out how many cycles an instruction takes. As a rule of thumb, an instruction takes as many cycles as the number of
memory fetches it has to perform, but at least two.
Therefore, single-byte opcodes (one byte fetches;
NOP/TAX/INX etc.) as well as instructions with immediate operands take two cycles. Zero page instructions take three memory accesses (opcode, address,
data), so they are three cycles. Absolute instructions
take four accesses (opcode, address low, address high,
data), so they are four cycles.
Read-modify-write instructions (INC/DEC/shift/
rotate) are an exception: They require 4 memory accesses for the zero page case and 5 otherwise, but they
take 5 and 6 cycles, respectively.
Branches take 3 cycles if they are taken and two if
they are not taken. And extra cycle has to be added if
the branch crosses a page boundary. JMP is 3, push is
3, pull is 4, JSR and RTS are 6 each.
All other timings can be looked up in the 6502's reference, but they are very easy to memorize."
