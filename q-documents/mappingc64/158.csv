"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $299-$29A?","address       $299-$29A      BAUDOF
Time Required to Send a Bit

This location holds the prescaler value used by CIA #2 timers A and B.

These timers cause an NMI interrupt to drive the RS-232 receive and
transmit routines CLOCK/PRESCALER times per second each, where CLOCK
is the system 02 frequency of 1,022,730 Hz (985,250 if you are using
the European PAL television standard rather than the American NTSC
standard), and PRESCALER is the value stored at 56580-1 ($DD04-5) and
56582-3 ($DD06-7), in low-byte, high-byte order.  You can use the
following formula to figure the correct prescaler value for a
particular RS-232 baud rate:

PRESCALER=((CLOCK/BAUDRATE)/2)-100

The American (NTSC standard) prescaler values for the standard RS-232
baud rates which the control register at 659 ($293) makes available
are stored in a table at 65218 ($FEC2), starting with the two-byte
value used for 50 baud.  The European (PAL standard) version of that
table is located at 58604 ($E4EC).

Location Range: 667-670 ($29B-$29E)
Byte Indices to the Beginning and End of Receive and Transmit Buffers

The two 256-byte First In, First Out (FIFO) buffers for RS-232 data
reception and transmission are dynamic wraparound buffers.  This means
that the starting point and the ending point of the buffer can change
over time, and either point can be anywhere withing the buffer.  If,
for example, the starting point is at byte 100, the buffer will fill
towards byte 255, at which point it will wrap around to byte 0 again.
To maintain this system, the following four locations are used as
indices to the starting and the ending point of each buffer."
