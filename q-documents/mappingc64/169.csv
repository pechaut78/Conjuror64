PAL/NTSC Flag

At power-on, a test is performed to see if the monitor uses the NTSC
(North American) or PAL (European) television standard.

This test is accomplished by setting a raster interrupt for scan line
311, and testing if the interrupt occurs.  Since NTSC monitors have
only 262 raster scan lines per screen, the interrupt will occur only
if a PAL monitor is used.  The results of that test are stored here,
with a 0 indicating an NTSC system in use, and one signifying a PAL
system.

This information is used by the routines which set the prescaler
values for the system IRQ timer, so that the IRQ occurs every 1/60
second.  Since the PAL system 02 clock runs a bit slower than the NTSC
version, this prescaler value must be adjusted accordingly."
