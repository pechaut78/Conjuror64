Perform LOAD

This routine sets the load address to the start of BASIC (from pointer
at 43 ($2B)), and calls the Kerneal LOAD routine.  If the load is
successful, it relinks the BASIC program so that the links agree with
the address to which it is loaded, and it resets the end of BASIC
pointer to reflect the new end of program text.  If the LOAD was done
while a program was running, the pointers are reset so that the
program starts executing all over again from the beginning.  A CLR is
not performed, so that the variables build so far are retained, and
their values are still accessible.  The pointer to the variable area
is not changed, but if the new program is longer than the one that
loaded it, the variable table will be partially overwritten.  This
will cause errors when the overwritten variables are referenced.
Likewise, strings whose text was referenced at its location within the
original program listing will be incorrect.

Since a LOAD from a program causes the program execution to continue
at the first line, when loading a machine language routine or data
file with a nonrelocating load (for example, LOAD'FILE',8,1) from a
program, you should read a flag and GOTO the line after the LOAD if
you don't want the program to keep rerunning indefinitely:

10 IF FLAG=1 THEN GOTO 30
20 FLAG=1:LOAD'FILE',8,1
30 REM PROGRAM CONTINUES HERE"
