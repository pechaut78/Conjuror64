BRK, Warm Start Routine

This routine is executed when the STOP/RESTORE combination of
keypresses occurs.  In addition, it is the default target address of
the BRK instruction vector.  This routine calls the Kernal
intialization routines RESTOR, IOINIT, and part of CINT.  It then
exits through the BASIC warm start vector at 40962 ($A002)."
