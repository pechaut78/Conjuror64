Initialize Screen and Keyboard

This is the original CINT Kernal routine, to which additions were made
in later versions of the Kernal.

After calling the routine at 58784 ($E5A0) to set up default I/O
values, this routine initializes the cursor blink flags, the keyboard
decode vector, the key repeat delay and frequency counters, the
current color code, and maximum keyboard buffer size.  It then falls
through to the next routine."
