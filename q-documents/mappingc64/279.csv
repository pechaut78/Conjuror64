Perform DIM

This command calls the next routine to create an array for every
variable dimensioned (since a statement can take the form DIM A(12),
B(13), C(14)...).  If the array element is referenced before a DIM
statement (for example, A(3)=4), the array will be dimensioned to 10
(as if DIM A(10) were executed).  Remember, DIMensioning an array to
10 really creates 11 elements (10).  The 0 element should always be
considered in calculating the size to DIMension your array."
