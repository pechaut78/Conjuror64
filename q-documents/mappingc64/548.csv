Output to the Screen

This is the main entry point for the part of CHROUT that handles
output to the screen device.  It takes an ASCII character number, and
tests if the character is printable.  If it is, it prints it (taking
into consideration the reverse flag, if any inserts are left, etc.).
If it is a nonprinting character, the routine performs the appropriate
cursor movement, color change, screen clearing, or whatever else might
be indicated."
