Maximum Keyboard Buffer Size

The value here indicates the maximum number of characters that the
keyboard buffer at 631 ($277) may hold at any one time.  Anytime that
the current buffer length in location 198 ($C6) matches the value
here, further keypresses will be ignored.

Although the maximum size of the keyboard buffer is usually 10
characters, it may be possible to extend it up to 15 characters by
changing the number here.  This could cause the Operating System
pointers to the bottom and top of memory at 641-644 ($281-$284) to be
overwritten, but no real harm should result."
