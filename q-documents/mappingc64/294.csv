Convert 16-Bit Signed Integer to Floating Point

This routine treats the value in the Accumulator as the high byte of a
16-bit signed integer, and the value in the .Y register as the low
byte, and converts the signed integer into a floating point number in
the Floating Point Accumulator.

The address of this routine is pointed to by the RAM vector at 5-6,
and the routine can be used to return an argument from the USR call in
the Floating Point Accumulator."
