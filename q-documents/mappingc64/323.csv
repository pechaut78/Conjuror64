"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $B82D?","address         $B82D          FUWAIT
Perform WAIT

WAIT gets an address parameter and an integer parameter to use as a
mask.  WAIT then looks for an optional parameter to use as a pattern
for the exclusive OR.  Then, the address location is read, its value
is exclusive ORed with the optional pattern value (or 0 if there is
none).  This value is ANDed with the mask value.  The command loops
continuously until the result is not- zero.

The purpose of this command is to allow the program to watch a
location which can be changed by the system or by outside hardware
(such as the software clock or keycode value locations).

The AND function lets you check if a bit changes from 0 to 1, while
the EOR function allows you to check if a bit changes from 1 to 0.

Instruction,' by Louis Sander and Doug Ferguson, in COMPUTE!'s First
