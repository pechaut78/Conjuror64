"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $13F-$1FF?","address       $13F-$1FF

This area is exclusively for the microprocessor stack.  Some BASIC
commands, such as FOR-NEXT loops require many stack entries at a time.
Therefore, BASIC frequently checks the stack before pushing entries
on, and returns an OUT OF MEMORY error if an operation would result in
less than 62 bytes of available stack memory.

Each FOR statement causes 18 bytes to be pushed onto the stack, which
come off in the following order:

First comes a one-byte constant of 129 ($81).  Next is a two-byte
pointer to the address of the subject variable (the X of FOR X=1 to
10).  This is followed by the five-byte floating point representation
of the TO value.  Finally comes the two-byte line number of the line
to which the program returns after a NEXT, and the two-byte address of
the next character to read in that line after the FOR statement.

Each GOSUB call places five bytes on the stack.  The first byte to
come off is a one-byte constant of 141 ($8D).  The next two bytes
contain the line number of the statement to which the program will
RETURN after the subroutine ends.  And the final two bytes are a
pointer to the address of the BASIC program text for that statement in
which the program RETURNs.

DEF also leaves a five-byte entry on the stack.  It is the same as
that described for GOSUB, except that instead of a constant byte of
141, the first number is a dummy byte, whose value has no
significance."
