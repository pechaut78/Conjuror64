Perform RAM Test and Set Pointers to the Top and Bottom of RAM

This documented Kernal routine, which can be entered through location
65415 ($FF87) of the jump table, performs a number of initialization
tasks.

First, it clears Pages 0, 2, and 3 of memory to zeros.  Next, it sets
the tape buffer pointer to address 828 ($33C), and performs a
nondestructive test of RAM from 1024 ($400) up.  When it reaches a
non-RAM address (presumably the BASIC ROM at 40960 ($A000)), that
address is placed in the top of memory pointer at 643-4 ($283-4).  The
bottom of memory pointer at 641-2 ($281-2) is set to point to address
2048 ($800), which is the beginning of BASIC program text.  Finally,
the pointer to screen memory at 648 ($288) is set to 4, which lets the
Operating System know that screen memory starts at 1024 ($400)."
