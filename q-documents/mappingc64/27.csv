Pointer to End of the BASIC Array Storage Area (+1), and the Start of
Free RAM

This location points to the address of the end of BASIC array storage
space and the start of free RAM.  Since string text starts at the top
of memory and builds downwards, this location can also be thought of
as the last possible address of the string storage area.  Defining new
variables pushes this pointer upward, toward the last string text.

If a string for which space is being allocated would cross over this
boundary into the array storage area, garbage collection is performed,
and if there still is not enough room, an OUT OF MEMORY error occurs.
FRE performs garbage collection, and returns the difference between
the addresses pointed to here and the address of the end of string
text storage pointed to by location 51 ($33)."
