"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $B3B3?","address         $B3B3          DEF
Perform DEF

DEF performs some syntax checking, and pushes five bytes onto the
stack:  the first byte of the function statement, a two-byte pointer
to the dependent variable (the X in FN(X)), and the address of the
first character of the definition itself, where it resides in the
program text.

The DEF statement must fit on one line, but functions can be extended
by nesting them (having one function call another)."
