Set Up the Proper Keyboard Decode Table

This routine is pointed to by the vector at 655 ($28F).  Its function
is to read the shift/control flag at 653 ($28D), and set the value of
the decode table pointer at 245 ($F5) accordingly.

First it checks if the SHIFT/Commodore logo combination was pressed,
and if the toggle enable at 657 (291) will allow a change, the
character set will be changed to lowercase/uppercase or
uppercase/graphics by changing the VIC Memory Control Register at
53272 ($D018), and no character will be printed.

Next it sets the decode table pointer.  There are 64 keys, and each
can have four different PETASCII values, depending on whether the key
is pressed by itself, or in combination with the SHIFT, CTRL, or
Commodore logo keys.  Therefore, there are four tables of 64 entries
each to translate the keycode to PETASCII:  the standard table, the
SHIFT table, the Commodore logo table, and the CONTROL table.  The
routine will set up the pointer for the appropriate table, depending
on whether the SHIFT, CTRL, or logo key was pressed.  The CTRL key
takes precedence, so that if another of these keys is pressed along
with the CTRL key, the CONTROL table is used."
