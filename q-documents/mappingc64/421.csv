"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $D01E?","address              $D01E          SP7COL
Sprite 7 Color Register (the default color value is 12, medium gray)

Location Range: 53295-53311 ($D02F-$D03F)
Not Connected

The VIC-II chip has only 47 registers for 64 bytes of possible address
space.  Therefore, the remaining 17 addresses do not access any
memory.  When read, they will always give a value of 255 ($FF).  This
value will not change after writing to them.

Location Range: 53312-54271 ($D040-$D3FF)

Since the VIC-II requires only enough addressing lines to handle 64
locations (the minimum possible for its 47 registers), none of the
higher bits are decoded when addressing this 1K area.  The result is
that every 64 byte area in this 1K block is a mirror of every other.
POKE53281+64,1 has the same effect as POKE53281,1 or
POKE53281+10*64,1; they all turn the screen background to white.  For
the sake of clarity in your programs it is advisable to use the base
address of the chip."
