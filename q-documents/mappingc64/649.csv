Restores the Default IRQ Routine

At the end of the tape I/O operations, this subroutine is used to turn
the screen back on and stop the cassette motor.  It then resets the
CIA #1 Timer A to generate an interrupt every sixtieth of a second,
and restores the IRQ vector to point to the normal interrupt routine
that updates the software clock and scans the keyboard."
