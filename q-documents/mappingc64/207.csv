Character ROM Image for VIC-II Chip When Using Memory Bank 0 (Default)

Though the VIC-II chip shares memory with the 6510 processor chip, it
does not always see that memory in exactly the same way as the main
microprocessor.

Although the 6510 accesses RAM at these locations, when the VIC-II is
banked to use the first 16K of RAM (which is the default condition),
it sees the character ROM here (the 6510 cannot access this ROM unless
it is switched into its memory at 49152 ($C000)).  This solves the
riddle of how the VIC-II chip can use the character ROM at 49152
($C000) for character shape data and RAM at 1024 ($400), when it can
only address memory within a 16K range.  It also means that the RAM at
4096-8191 cannot be used for screen display memory or user-defined
character dot data, and sprite data blocks 64-127 are not accessible.

You can verify this by turning on bitmap graphics with the screen
memory set to display addresses from 0 to 8192.  You will see that the
bottom portion of the screen shows all of the text character shapes
stored in the ROM.  For more information on the format of text
character data storage, see the description of the Character ROM at
49152 ($C000)."
