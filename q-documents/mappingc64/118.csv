Current Cursor Physical Line Number

This location contains the current physical screen line position of
the cursor (0-24).  It can be used in a fashion to move the cursor
vertically, by POKEing the target screen line (1-25) minus 1 here,
followed by a PRINT command.  For example,

POKE 214,9:PRINT:PRINT 'WE'RE ON LINE ELEVEN'

prints the message on line 11.  The first PRINT statement allows the
system to update the other screen editor variables so that they will
also show the new line.  The cursor can also be set or read using the
Kernal PLOT routine (58634, $E50A) as explained in the entry from
locations 780-783 ($30C-$30F)."
