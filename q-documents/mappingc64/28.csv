Pointer to the Bottom of the String Text Storage Area

This pointer marks the current end of the string text area, and the
top of free RAM (strings are built from the top of memory downward).
Additional string texts are added, to the area below the address
pointed to here.  After they are added, this pointer is lowered to
point below the newly added string text.  The garbage collection
routine (which is also called by FRE) readjusts this pointer upward.

While the power-on/reset routines set this pointer to the top of RAM,
the CLR command sets this pointer to the end of BASIC memory, as
indicated in location 55 ($37).  This allows the user to set aside an
area of BASIC memory that will not be disturbed by the program, as
detailed at location 55 ($37)."
