Flag: SHIFT/CTRL/Logo Keypress

This flag signals which of the SHIFT, CTRL, or Commodore logo keys are
currently being pressed, if any.

A value of 1 signifies that one of the SHIFT keys is being pressed, a
2 shows that the Commodore logo key is down, and 4 means that the CTRL
key is being pressed.  If more than one key is held down, these values
will be added; for example, a 3 indicates that SHIFT and logo are both
held down.

The value here is used by the Operating System when determining how to
convert a keypress into a PETASCII character.  There are four
different tables used to translate one of the 64 keys on the keyboard
matrix into a PETASCII character, and the combination of special SHIFT
keys determines which of these tables will be used (see the entry for
location 245 ($F5) for more details on the keyboard tables).

Pressing the SHIFT and Commodore logo keys at the same time will
toggle the character set that is presently being used between the
uppercase/graphics set, and the lowercase/uppercase set (provided that
the flag at 657 ($291) has not been set to disable this switch).

This changes the appearance of all of the characters on the screen at
once.  It has nothing whatever to do with the keyboard shift tables,
however, and should not be confused with the printing of SHIFTed
characters, which affects only one character at a time.  Rather, it is
the result of the value of the character dot data table base address
in 53272 ($D018) being changed.  The came result may be obtained by
POKEing that address directly."
