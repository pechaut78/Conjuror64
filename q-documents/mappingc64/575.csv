Video Chip Register Default Table

This table contains the default values that are stored in the 47
VIC-II chip registers.  It is interesting to note that this table
appears to be incomplete.  While Sprite Color Registers 0-6 are
initialized to values of 1-7, Sprite Color Register 7 is initialized
to 76--the ASCII value of the letter L which begins on the next table."
