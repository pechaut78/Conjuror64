Update the Software Clock and Check for the STOP Key

UDTIM is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered through the
jump table at 65514 ($FFEA).

It is normally called by the IRQ interrupt handler once every sixtieth
of a second.  It adds one to the value in the three-byte software
jiffy clock at 160-162 ($A0-$A2), and sets the clock back to zero when
it reaches the 24 hour point.  In addition, it scans the keyboard row
in which the STOP key is located, and stores the current value of that
key in location 145 ($91).  This variable is used by the STOP routine
which checks for the STOP key."
