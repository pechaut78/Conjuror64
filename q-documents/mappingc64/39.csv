Temporary Pointer to the Index Variable Used by FOR

The address of the BASIC variable which is the subject of a FOR/NEXT
loop is first stored here, but is then pushed onto the stack.  That
leaves this location free to be used as a work area by such statements
as INPUT, GET, READ, LIST, WAIT, CLOSE, LOAD, SAVE, RETURN, and GOSUB.

For a description of the stack entries made by FOR, see location 256
($100)."
