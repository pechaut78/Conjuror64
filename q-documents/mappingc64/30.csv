Pointer to the Highest Address Used by BASIC

The power-on/reset routine tests each byte of RAM until it comes to
the BASIC ROM, and sets this pointer to the adress of the highest byte
of consecutive RAM found (40959, $9FFF).

There are two circumstances under which this pointer may be changed
after power-up to reflect an address lower than the actual top of
consecutive RAM:

1.  Users may wish to lower this pointer themselves, in order to set
aside an area of free RAM that will not be disturbed by BASIC.  For
example, to set aside a 1K area at the top of BASIC, start your
program with the line:

POKE 56,PEEK(56)-4:CLR

The CLR is necessary to insure that the string text will start below
your safe area.

You may wish to store machine language programs, sprites, or alternate
character sets in such an area.  For the latter two applications,
however, keep in mind the 16K addressing range limitation of the
VIC-II chip.  If you do not assign the VIC-II to a bank other than the
default memory bank of 0-16383 ($0-$3FFF), you must lower the top of
memory below 16383 ($3FFF) if you wish your sprite or character data
area to be within its addressing range.

2.  Then the RS-232 device (number 2) is opened, this pointer and the
pointer to the end of user RAM at 643 are lowered by 512 bytes in
order to create two 256-byte buffers, one for input and the other for
output.

Since the contents of these buffers will overwrite any variables at
the top of memory, a CLR command is issued at the time device 2 is
opened.  Therefore, the RS-232 device should be opened before defining
any variables, and before setting aside a safe area for machine
language programs or other uses, as described above.
