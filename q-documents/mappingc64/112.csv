"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $CF?","address           $CF            BLNON
Flag: Was Last Curson Blink on or off?

This location keeps track of whether, during the current cursor blink,
the character under the cursor was reversed, or was restored to
normal.  This location will contain a 0 if the character is reversed,
and a 1 if the character is restored to its nonreversed status."
