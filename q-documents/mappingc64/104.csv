Number of Characters in Keyboard Buffer (Queue)

The value here indicates the number of charracters waiting in the
keyboard buffer at 631 ($277).  The maximum number of characters in
the keyboard buffer at any one time is determined by the value in
location 649 ($289), which defaults to 10.

If INPUT or GET is executed while there are already characters in the
buffer, those characters will be read as part of the data stream.  You
can prevent this by POKEing a 0 to this location before those
operations, which will always cause any character in the buffer to be
ignored.  This technique can be handy when using the joystick in
Controller Port #1, which sometimes causes fake keypresses to be
registered, placing unwanted characters in the keyboard buffer.

Not only is this location handy for taking unwanted characters out of
the keyboard buffer, but it can also be used to put desired characters
into the buffer, and thus to program the keyboard buffer.  This
technique (dynamic keyboard) allows you to simulate keyboard input in
direct mode from a program.

The dynamic keyboard technique is an extremely useful one, as it
enables you to add, delete, or modify program lines while the program
is running.  The basic scheme is to POKE the PETASCII character values
that you wish to be printed (including cursor control characters and
carriage returns) into the buffer.  Then, when an END statement is
executed, the characters in the buffer will be printed, and entered by
the carriage return.

This technique can help with the problem of trying to use data
separation and terminator characters with INPUT statements.  If you
try to INPUT a string that has a comma or colon, the INPUT will read
only up to that character and issue an EXTRA IGNORED error message.
You can avoid this by entering the input string in quotes, but this
places on the user the burder of remembering the quote marks.  One
solution is to use the statements:

POKE 198,3:POKE 631,34: POKE 632,34: POKE 633,20

before the input.  This will force two quote marks and a delete into
the buffer.  The first quote mark allows the comma or colon to be
INPUT, the second is used to get the editor out of quote mode, and the
delete removes that second quote.
