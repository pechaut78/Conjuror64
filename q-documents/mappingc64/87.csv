Pointer to the Starting Address of a Load/Screen Scrolling

The pointer to the start of the RAM area to be SAVEd or LOADed at 193
($C1) is copied here.  This pointer is used as a working version, to
be increased as the data is received or transmitted.  At the end of
the operation, the initial value is restored here.  Screen management
routines temporarily use this as a work pointer."
