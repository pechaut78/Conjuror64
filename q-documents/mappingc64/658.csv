Set the RAM Vector Table from the Table Pointed to by .X and .Y

This documented Kernal routine can be entered through the jump table
at 65421 ($FF8D).

It is used to read or change the values for the 16 RAM vectors to the
interrupt and important Kernal I/O routines in the table that starts
at 788 ($314).  If the Carry flag is set when the routine is called,
the current value of the 16 vectors will be stored at a table whose
address is pointed to by the values in the .X and .Y registers.  If
the Carry flag is cleared, the RAM vectors will be loaded from the
table whose address is pointed to by the .X and .Y registers.  Since
this routine can change the vectors for the IRQ and NMI interrupts,
you might expect that the Interrupt disable flag would be set at its
beginning.  Such is not the case, however, and therefore it would be
wise to execute an SEI before calling it and a CLI afterwards (as the
power-on RESET routine does) just to be safe.
