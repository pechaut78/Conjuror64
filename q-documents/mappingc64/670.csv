NMI Interrupt Entry Point

This routine is the NMI interrupt handler entry, which is pointed to
by the hardware NMI vector at 65530 ($FFFA).

Any time an NMI interrupt occurs, the Interrupt disable flag will be
set, and the routine will jump through the RAM vector at 792 ($318),
which ordinarily points to the continuation of this routine.  The
standard handler first checks to see if the NMI was caused by the
RS-232 device.  If not, the RESTORE key is assumed.  The routine
checks for a cartridge, and if one is found it exits through the
cartridge warm start vector at 32770 ($8002).  If not, the STOP key is
checked, and if it is being pressed, the BRK routine is executed.  If
the RS-232 device was the cause of the NMI, the cartridge and STOP key
checks are bypassed, and the routine skips to the end, where it checks
whether it is time to send or receive a data bit via the RS-232
device."
