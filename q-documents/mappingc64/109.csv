Cursor Blink Enable: 0=Flash Cursor

When this flag is set to a nonzero value, it indicates to the routine
that normally flashes the cursor not to do so.  The cursor blink is
turned off when there are characters in the keyboard buffer, or when
the program is running.

You can use this location to turn the cursor on during a program (for
a series of GET operations, for example, to show the user that input
is expected) by using the statement POKE 204,0."
