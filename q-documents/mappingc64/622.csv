Save RAM to a Device

This is a documented Kernal routine, whose entry in the jump table
appears at 65496 ($FFD8).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 818 ($332).  SAVE is used to
transfer data directly from RAM to an I/O device.  Since the SAVE
routine performs an OPEN, it must be preceded by a call to the SETLFS
routine to specify the logical file number, device number, and
secondary address, and a call to the SETNAM routine to specify the
filename (although a SAVE to the cassette can be performed without
giving a filename).  A Page 0 pointer to the starting address of the
area to be saved should be set up, with the low byte of the address
first.  The accumulator should be loaded with the Page 0 offset of
that pointer, then the .X and .Y registers should be set with the
ending address for the save, and the SAVE routine called."
