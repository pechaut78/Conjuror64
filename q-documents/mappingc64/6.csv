Search Character for Scanning BASIC Text Input

This location and the next are used heavily by the BASIC routines that
scan the text that comes into the buffer at 512 ($200), in order to
detect significant characters such as quotes, comma, the colon which
separates BASIC statements, and end-of-line.  The ASCII values of such
special characters are usually stored here.

This location is also used as a work area by other BASIC routines that
do not involve scanning text."
