Restore Current Input and Output Devices to the Default Devices

This is a documented Kernal Routine which can be entered at location
65484 ($FFCC) in the jump table.

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 802 ($322).  It sets the
current input device to the keyboard, and the current output device to
the screen.  Also, if the current input device was formerly a serial
device, the routine sends it an UNTALK command on the serial bus, and
if a serial device was formerly the current output device, the routine
sends it an UNLISTEN command."
