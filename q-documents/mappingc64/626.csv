This documented Kernal routine can be entered from location 65499
($FFDB).

It performs the reverse operation from RDTIM, storing the value in the
.Y register into location 160 ($A0), the .X register into 161 ($A1),
and the Accumulator into 162 ($A2).  Interrupts are first disabled, to
make sure that the clock will not be updated while being set."
