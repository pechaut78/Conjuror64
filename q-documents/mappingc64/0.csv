"What is the purpose of the memory location at address 0-255?","Page zero
Memory locations 0-255 ($0-$FF) have a special significance in 6502
machine language programming (the 6510 microprocessor in the Commodore
64 shares the same instruction set as the 6502).  Since these
addresses cn be expressed using just one byte, instructions which
access data stored in these locations are shorter and execute more
quickly than do instructions which operate on addresses in higher
memory, which requires two bytes.

Because of this relatively fast execution time, most 6502 software
makes heavy use of zero-page locations.  The 64 is no exception, and
uses this area for many important system variables and pointers.

In addition, locations 0 and 1 have special Input/Output functions on
the 6510.  In the case of the 64, this on-chip I/O port is used to
select the possible combinations of ROM, as we will se below, and to
control cassette I/O."
