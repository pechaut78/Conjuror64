Vector: Routine to Convert a Number from Floating Point to Signed
Integer

This vector points to the address of the BASIC routine which converts
a floating point number to an integer.  In the current Kernal version,
the address that it points to is 45482 ($B1AA).  Disassembly of the
ROMs indicates that BASIC does not use this vector.  However, it may
be of real assistance to the programmer who wishes to use data that is
stored in floating point format.  The parameter that is passed by the
USR command is available only in that format, for example.

Since it is extremely difficult to decipher and use a floating point
number, the simplest way to deal with such data is to use the
conversion routines that are built into BASIC to change it into a
two-byte signed integer.  This could be accomplished by jumping
directly into the BASIC ROM, if you know the location of the routine.
Therefore, if the address changes in future versions of the 64 or
future Commodore computers, you won't have to modify your program to
make it work with them.

See the entry for the USR vector at 785 ($311) for an explanation of
how to use this routine in connection with the USR command."
