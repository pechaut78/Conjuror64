"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $281-282?","address       $281-282       MEMSTR
Pointer: O.S. Start of Memory

When the power is first turned on, or a cold start RESET is performed,
the Kernal routine RAMTAS (64848, $FD50) sets this location to point
to address 2048 ($800).  This indicates that this is the starting
address of user RAM.  BASIC uses this location to set its own start of
memory pointer at location 43 ($2B), and thereafter uses only its own
pointer.

The Kernal routine MEMBOT (65076, $FE34) may be used to read or set
this pointer, or these locations may be directly PEEKed or POKEd from
BASIC."
