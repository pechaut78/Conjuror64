"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $F34A?","address              $F34A          OPEN
Open a Logical I/O File

OPEN is a documented Kernal I/O routine.  It can be entered from the
jump table at 65472 ($FFC0).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 794 ($31A).  This routine
assigns a logical file to a device, so that it can be used for
Input/Output operations.  In order to specify the logical file number,
the device number, and the secondary address if any, the SETLFS
routine must first be called.  Likewise, in order to designate the
filename, the SETNAM routine must be used first.  After these two
routines are called, OPEN is then called."
