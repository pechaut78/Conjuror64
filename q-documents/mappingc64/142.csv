Color of Character under Cursor

This location is used to keep track of the original color code of the
character stored at the present cursor location.  Since the blinking
cursor uses the current foreground color at 646 ($286), the original
value must be stored here so that if the cursor moves on without
changing that character, its color code can be restored to its
original value."
