Light Pen Horizontal Position

This location holds the horizontal position of the light pen.  Since
there are only eight bits available (which give a range of 256 values)
for 320 possible horizontal screen positions, the value here is
accurate only to every second dot position.  The number here will
range from 0 to 160 and must be multiplied by 2 in order to get a
close approximation of the actual horizontal dot position of the light
pen."
