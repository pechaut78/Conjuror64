Standard Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the standard keyboard,
one for each key which is struck by itself.  The table is in keycode
order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the correspondence of
keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255 ($FF) marks the
end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value of 64, no key
pressed)."
