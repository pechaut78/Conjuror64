"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $B80D?","address         $B80D          PEEK

PEEK reads the address parameter and converts it to a pointer.  Then
it gets the byte pointed to into the .Y register, and calls the part
of POS that converts a single integer in .Y to a floating point
number."
