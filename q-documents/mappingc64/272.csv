Check for and Skip Comma

This syntax checking device is the same in substance as the two
checking routines above.  It is used when the next character should be
a comma.  If it is not, a SYNTAX ERROR retults.  If it is, the
character is skipped and the next character is read.  Any character
can be checked for and skipped this way by loading the character into
the Accumulator and entering this routine from SYNCHR at 44799
($AEFF)."
