Baud Rate Table for European (PAL) Standard Monitors

This table of prescaler values was added to later Kernal versions to
allow the same Kernal software to be used with either U.S. or European
64s.  It contains the values which are required to obtain interrupts
at the proper frequency for the standard RS-232 baud rates, and
corresponds exactly in format to the table of values for the U.S.
(NTSC) monitor format at 65218 ($FEC2).  Separate tables are required
because the prescaler values are derived from dividing the system
clock rate by the baud rate, and PAL machines operate with a slightly
slower clock frequency."
