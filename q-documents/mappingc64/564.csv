IRQ Interrupt Entry

This is the entry point to the standard IRQ interrupt handler.  Timer
A of CIA #1 is set at power-on to cause an IRQ interrupt to occur
every 1/60 second.  When the interrupt occurs, program flow is
transferred here via the CINV vector at 788 ($314).  This routine
updates the software clock at 160-162 ($A0-$A2), handles the cursor
flash, and maintains the tape interlock which keeps the cassette motor
on if a button is pushed and the interlock flag is on.  Finally, it
calls the keyboard scan routine, which checks the keyboard and puts
any character it finds into the keyboard buffer."
