"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $0328-$0329?","address       $328-$329      ISTOP
Vector to Kernal STOP Routine (Currently at 63213 ($F6ED))

This vector points to the address of the routine that tests the STOP
key.  The STOP key can be disabled by changing this with a POKE
808,239.  This will not disable the STOP/RESTORE combination, however.
To disable both STOP and STOP/ RESTORE, POKE 808,234 (POKEing 234 here
will cause the LIST command not to function properly).  To bring
things back to normal in either case, POKE 808, 237."
