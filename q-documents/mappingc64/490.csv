"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $E000?","address              $E000
Continuation of EXP Routine

This routine is split, with part on the BASIC ROM and the other part
here.  Since the two ROMs do not occupy contiguous memory as on most
Commodore machines, the BASIC ROM ends with a JMP $E000 instruction.
Thus, while the BASIC interpreter on the 64 is for the most part the
same as on the VIC, the addresses for routines in this ROM are
displaced by three bytes from their location on the VIC."
