Store Base Address of Memory-Mapped I/O Devices in .X and .Y Registers

This is one of the documented Kernal routines for which there is a
vector in the jump table at 65523 ($FFF3).

When called, this routine sets the .X register to the low byte of the
base address of the memory-mapped I/O devices, and puts the high byte
in the .Y register.  This allows a user to set up a zero-page pointer
to the device, and to load and store indirectly through that pointer.
A program which uses this method, rather than directly accessing such
devices could be made to function without change on future Commodore
models, even though the I/O chips may be addressed at different
locations.  This of course assumes that the CIA or a similar chip will
be used.  This routine is of limited value for creating software that
is compatible with both the VIC-20 and the 64 because of the
differences in the VIA I/O chip that the VIC uses.

The current version of this routine loads the .X register with a 0,
and the .Y register with 220 ($DC), thus pointing to CIA #1, which is
at 56320 ($DC00)."
