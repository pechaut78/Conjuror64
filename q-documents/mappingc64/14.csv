"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $F?","address            $F             GARBFL
Flag for LIST, Garbage Collection, and Program Tokenization

The LIST routine uses this byte as a flag to let it know when it has
come to a character string in quotes.  It will then print the string,
rather than search it for BASIC keyword tokens.

The garbage collection routine uses this location as a flag to
indicate that garbage collection has already been tried before adding
a new string.  If there is still not enough memory, an OUT OF MEMORY
message will result.

This location is also used as a work byte for the process of
converting a line of text in the BASIC input buffer (512, $200) into a
linked program line of BASIC keyword tokens."
