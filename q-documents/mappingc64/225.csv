"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $A480-$A49B?","address   $A480-$A49B    MAIN
Main Loop, Receives Input and Executes Immediately or Stores as
Program Line

This is the main BASIC program loop.  It jumps through the RAM vector
at 770 ($302), so this routine can be diverted.  The routine gets a
line of input from the keyboard, and checks for a line number.  If
there is a line number, the program branches to the routine that
stores a line of program text.  If there is no line number, it
branches to the routine that executes statements."
