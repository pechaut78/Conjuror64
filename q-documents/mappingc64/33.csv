"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $3D-$3E?","address         $3D-$3E        OLDTXT
Pointer to the Address of the Current BASIC Statement

This location contains the address (not the line number) of the text
of the BASIC statement that is being executed.  The value of TXTPTR
(122, $7A), the pointer tot he address of the BASIC text character
currently being scanned, is stored here each time a new BASIC line
begins execution.

END, STOP, and the STOP-key BREAK save the value of TXTPTR here, and
CONT restores this value to TXTPTR.  CONT will not continue if 62
($3E) has been changed to a zero by a LOAD, a modification to the
program text, or by error routines."
