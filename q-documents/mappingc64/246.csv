"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $A8D2?","address         $A8D2          RETURN

The RETURN statement finds the saved GOSUB data on the stack, and uses
it to restore the pointers to the current line and current character.
This will cause execution to continue where it left off when GOSUB was
executed."
