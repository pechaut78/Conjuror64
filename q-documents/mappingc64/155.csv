"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $295-$296?","address       $295-$296      M51AJB
RS-232: Nonstandard Bit Timing

These locations are provided for storing a nonstandard user-defined
baud rate, to be used when the low nybble of the control register at
659 ($293) is set to 0.  They were presumable provided to conform to
the nodel of the 6551 UART device, which allows a nonstandard baud
rate to be generated from an external reference crystal.  However, the
software emulation of that feature is not provided in the current
version of the Kernal, and thus these locations are currently
nonfunctional.

Nonetheless, Commodore has specified that if the nonstandard baud rate
feature is implemented, the value placed here should equal the system
clock frequency divided by the baud rate divided by 2 minus 100,
stored in low byte, high byte order.  The system clock frequency for
American television monitors (NTSC standard) is 1.02273 MHz, and for
European monitors (PAL standard) .98525 MHz."
