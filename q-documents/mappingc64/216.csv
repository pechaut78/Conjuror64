Operator Dispatch Vector Table

This table contains two-byte vectors, each of which points to an
address which is one byte before the address of one of the routines
that perform a BASIC math operation.

For the reasoning behind the one-byte offset to the true address, see
the entry for location 40972 ($A00C).  In addition, each entry has a
one-byte number which indicates the degree of precedence that
operation takes.  Operations with a higher degree of precedence are
performed before operations of a lower degree (for example, in the
expression A=3+4*6, the 4*6 operation is performed first, and 3 is
added to the total).  The order in which they are performed is:

1.  Expressions in parentheses
2.  Exponentation (raising to a power, using the up-arrow symbol)
3.  Negation of an expression (-5, -A)
4.  Multiplication and division
5.  Addition and subtraction
6.  Relation tests (=, <>, <, >, <=, >= all have the same precedence)
7.  NOT (logical operation)
8.  AND (logical operation)
9.  OR (logical operation)

The substance of this table, which can be used to locate the addresses
of the math routines, is given below.  Note that less that, equal, and
greater than operators all use the same routines, though they have
different token numbers."
