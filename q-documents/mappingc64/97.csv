Pointer: Current Filename

This location holds a pointer to the address of the current filename.
If an operation which OPENs a tape file does not specify a filename,
this pointer is not used.

When a disk filename contains a shifted space character, the remainder
of the name will appear outside the quotes in the directory, and may
be used for comments.  For example, if you SAVE 'ML[shifted
space]SYS828', the directory entry will read 'ML'SYS 828.  You may
reference the program either by the portion of the name that appears
within quotes, or by the full name, including the shifted space.  A
program appearing later in the directory as 'ML'SYS 900 would not be
found just by reference to 'ML', however.

A filename of up to four characters may be used when opening the
RS-232 device.  These four characters will be copied to 659-662
($293-$296), where they are used to control such parameters as baud
rate, parity, and word length."
