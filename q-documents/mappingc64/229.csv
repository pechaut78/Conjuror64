Tokenize Line in Input Buffer

When a line of program text has been input into the BASIC text buffer
at 512 ($200), this routine goes through the line and changes any
keywords or their abbreviations, which do not appear in quotes, into
their corresponding token.  This command is vectored through RAM at
772 ($304), so it can be diverted in order to add new commands."
