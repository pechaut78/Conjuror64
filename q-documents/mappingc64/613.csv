Close a Logical I/O File

CLOSE is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered via the jump
table at 65475 ($FFC3).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 796 ($31C).  It is used to
close a logical file after all I/O operations involving that file have
been completed.  This is accomplished by loading the Accumulator with
the logical file number of the file to be closed, and calling this
routine.

Closing an RS-232 file will de-allocate space at the top of memory for
the receiving and trasmit buffers.  Closing a cassette file that was
opened for writing will force the last block to be written to
cassette, even if it is not a full 192 bytes.  Closing a serial bus
device will send an UNLISTEN command on the bus.  Remember, it is
necessary to properly CLOSE a cassette or disk data file in order to
retrieve the file later.

For all types of files, CLOSE removes the file's entry from the tables
of logical files, device, and secondary address at 601, 611, and 621
($259, $263, $26D), and moves all higher entries in the table down one
space."
