Clear Color RAM to the Color in Background Color Register 0

This routine is a patch added to the more recent versions of the
Kernal.  It is called by the routine which clears a screen line
(59903, $E9FF), and it places the color value in Background Color
Register 0 (53281, $D021) into the current byte of Color RAM pointed
to by USER (243, $F3).

In the original version of the Kernal, the routine that cleared a
screen line set the corresponding Color RAM to a value of 1, which
gives text characters a white foreground color.  This was changed when
the white color was found to sometimes cause light flashes during
screen scrolling.  It was that white foreground color, however, that
enabled the user to POKE the screen code for a character into screen
RAM, and make that character appear on the screen in a color that
contrasted the blue background.  This change to the Operating System
causes colors POKEd to screen RAM to be the same color as the
background, and thus they are invisible.

This is a fairly serious problem, because the technique of POKEing
characters to screen RAM has long been a staple of Commodore graphics
programming.  Fortunately, the problem has an easy colution.  Since
the Color RAM will be set to whatevere color is in Background Color
Register 0, what you have to do to initialize Color RAM to the color
you desire is change the background color to the desired foreground
color, clear the screen, and then change the background color back
again:

C=PEEK(53281):POKE 53281,HUE:PRINT CHR$(147):POKE 53281,C"
