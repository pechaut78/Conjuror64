Flag: Print Reverse Characters? 0=No

When the [CTRL][RVS-ON] characters are printer (CHR$(18)), this flag
is set to 18 ($12), and the print routines will add 128 ($80) to the
screen code of each character which is printed, so that the caracter
will appear on the screen with its colors reversed.

POKEing this location directly with a nonzero number will achieve the
same results.  You should remember, however, that the contents of this
location are returned to 0 not only upon entry of a [CTRL][RVS-OFF]
character (CHR$(146)), but also at every carriage return.  When this
happens, characters printed thereafter appear with the normal
comination of colors."
