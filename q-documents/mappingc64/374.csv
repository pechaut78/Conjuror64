"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $C000-$CFFF?","address   $C000-$CFFF
4K Free RAM

Locations 49152 to 53247 ($C000 to $CFFF) are free RAM.  Since this
area is not contiguous with the BASIC program text RAM area, it is not
available for BASIC program or variable storage (it is not counted in
the FRE(0) total).

This area is fully available for any other use, however, sudh as
storing machine language subroutines for use with BASIC, alternate I/O
drivers for parallel or IEEE devices, character graphics or sprite
data, etc.

This large free area is such a tempting spot for system additions that
many such applications may be competing for the same RAM space.  For
example, the Universal Wedge DOS Support program that adds easy access
to the disk communications channel is usually loaded at 52224 ($CC00).
Programs that use that part of RAM will therefore overwrite the DOS
support program, with the result that they may not run correctly, or
even at all.  Likewise, Simon's BASIC, the extended language which
Commodore has released on cartridge, uses several locations in this
range.  Be aware of this potential problem when you buy hardware
additions that use this spot to hook into the system."
