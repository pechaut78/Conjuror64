Print BASIC Tokens as ASCII Characters

This is the part of the LIST routine that chagnes one-byte program
tokens back to their ASCII text characters.  The routine is vectored
through RAM at 774 ($306), so it is possible to list out new command
words that you have added by changing this vector to detour through
your own routine."
