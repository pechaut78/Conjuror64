SHIFTed Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the shifted keyboard,
one for each key which is struck while the SHIFT key is pressed.  The
table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the
correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255
($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value
of 64, no key pressed)."
