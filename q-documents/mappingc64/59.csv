"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $71-$72?","address       $71-$72        FBUFPT
Series Evaluation Pointer

This location points to the address of a temporary table of values
built in the free RAM area for the evaluation of formulas.  It is also
used for such various purposes as a TI$ work area, string setup
pointer, and work space for the evaluation of the size of an array.

Although this is labeled a pointer to the tape buffer in the
Programmer's Reference Guide, disassembly of the BASIC ROM reveals no
reference to this location for that purpose (see 178 ($B2) for pointer
to tape buffer)."
