"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $316-$317?","address       $316-$317      CBINV
Vector: BRK Instruction Interrupt

This vector points to the address of the routine which will be
executed anytime that a 6510 BRK instruction (00) is encountered.

The default value points to a routine that calls several of the Kernal
initialization routines such as RESTOR, IOINIT and part of CINT, and
then jumps through the BASIC warm start vector at 40962.  This is the
same routine that is used when the STOP and RESTORE keys are pressed
simultaneously, and is currently located at 65126 ($Fe66).

A machine language monitor program will usually change this vector to
point to the monitor warm start address, so that break points may be
set that will return control to the monitor for debugging purposes."
