Vector to IRQ Interrupt Routine

This vector points to the address of the routine that is executed when
an IRQ interrupt occurs (normally 59953 ($FA31)).

At power on, the CIA #1 Timer B is set to cause an IRQ interrupt to
occur every 1/60 second.  This vector is set to point to the routine
which updates the software clock and STOP key check, blinks the
cursor, maintains the tape interlock, and reads the keyboard.  By
changing this vector, the user can add or substitute a machine
language routine that will likewise execute every 1/60 second.  The
user who is writing IRQ interrupt routines should consider the
following:

1.  It is possible for an IRQ interrupt to occur while you are
changing this vector, which would cause an error from which no
recovery could be made.  Therefore, you must disable all IRQ
interrupts before changing the contents of this location, and reenable
them afterwards, by using the 6510 SEI and CLI instructions, or by
using the Kernal VECTOR routine (64794, $FD1A) to set this vector.

2.  There is some code in ROM that is executed before the interrupt
routine is directed through this vector.  This code checks whether the
source of the interrupt was an IRQ or BRK instruction.  If first
preserves the contents of all the registers by pushing them onto the
stack in the following sequence:  PHA, TXA, PHA, TYA, PHA.  It is up
to the user to restore the stack at the end of his routine, either by
exiting through the normal IRQ, or with the sequence:  PLA, TAY, PLA,
TAX, PLA, RTI.

3.  There is only one IRQ vector, but there are many sources for IRQ
interrupts (two CIA chips, and several VIC chip IRQs).  If you plan to
enable IRQs from more than one source, the IRQ routine here must
determine the source, and continue the routine in the appropriate
place for an IRQ from that source.

In the same vein, if you replace the normal IRQ routine with your own,
you should be aware that the keyboard's scanning and clock update will
not occur unless you call the old interrupt routine once every 1/60
second.  It is suggested that if you plan to use that routine, you
save the old vector address in some other location.  In that way, you
can JuMP to the keyboard interrupt routine through this alternate
vector, rather than assuming that the ROM address will never change
and that it is safe to jump into the ROM directly."
