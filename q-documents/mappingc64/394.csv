Most Significant Bits of Sprites 0-7 Horizontal Position

Bit 0:  Most significant bit of Sprite 0 horizontal position
Bit 1:  Most significant bit of Sprite 1 horizontal position
Bit 2:  Most significant bit of Sprite 2 horizontal position
Bit 3:  Most significant bit of Sprite 3 horizontal position
Bit 4:  Most significant bit of Sprite 4 horizontal position
Bit 5:  Most significant bit of Sprite 5 horizontal position
Bit 6:  Most significant bit of Sprite 6 horizontal position
Bit 7:  Most significant bit of Sprite 7 horizontal position

Setting one of these bites to 1 adds 256 to the horizontal position of
the corresponding sprite.  Resetting one of these bits to 0 restricts
the horizontal position of the corresponding sprite to a value of 255
or less"
