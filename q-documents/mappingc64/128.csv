Microprocessor Stack Area

Locations 256-511 are reserved for the 6510 microprocessor hardware
stack.  The organization of this temporary storage area has often been
compared to that of a push-down stack of trays at a cafeteria.  The
first number placed on the stack goes to the bottom, and subsequent
entries are placed on top of it.  Then you pull a number off the
stack, you come up with the last number that was pushed on (such a
stack is called a Last In, First Out, or LIFO stack).

The stack is controlled by one of the microprocessor registers called
the Stack Pointer, which keeps track of the last stack location used.
The first number placed on the stack goes to location 511 ($1FF), and
subsequent entries are built downward toward 256 ($100).  If more than
256 numbers are pushed onto the stack, the Stack Pointer will start
counting from 0 again, and an overflow error will result.  Likewise,
if you try to pull more items off the stack than have been pushed on,
an underflow error will result.  Most often, such errors will cause
the system to go haywire, and nothing will operate until you turn the
power off and on again.

The stack is used by the system to keep track of the return addresses
of machine language subroutines and interrupt calls and to save the
contents of internal registers.  The stack can also be used by the
programmer for temporary storage.  BASIC and the Kernal make heavy use
of the stack.

Microsoft BASIC uses part of the stack for a temporary work area.
Therefore, the stack may be broken down into the following subregions:"
