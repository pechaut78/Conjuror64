Sprite Enable Register

Bit 0:  Enable Sprite 0 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 1:  Enable Sprite 1 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 2:  Enable Sprite 2 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 3:  Enable Sprite 3 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 4:  Enable Sprite 4 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 5:  Enable Sprite 5 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 6:  Enable Sprite 6 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)
Bit 7:  Enable Sprite 7 (1=sprite is on, 0=sprite is off)

In order for any sprite to be displayed, the corresponding bit in this
register must be set to 1 (the default for this location is 0).  Of
course, just setting this bit along will not guarantee that a sprite
will be shown on the screen.  The Sprite Data Pointer must indicate a
data area that holds some values other than 0.  The Sprite Color
Register must also contain a value other than that of the background
color.  In addition, the Sprite Horizontal and Vertical Position
Registers must be set for positions that lie within the visible screen
range in order for a sprite to appear on screen."
