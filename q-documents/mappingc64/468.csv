Serial Data Port

The CIA chip has an on-chip serial port, which allows you to send or
receive a byte of data one bit at a time, with the most significant
bit (Bit 7) being transferred first.  Control Register A at 56334
($DC0E) allows you to choose input or output modes.  In input mode, a
bit of data is read from the SP line (pin 5 of the User Port) whenever
a signal on the CNT line (pin 4) appears to let you know that it is
time for a read.  After eight bits are received this way, the data is
placed in the Serial Port Register, and an interrupt is generated to
let you know that the register should be read.

In output mode, you write data to the Serial Port Register, and it is
sent out over the SP line (pin 5 of the User Port), using Timer A for
the baud rate generator.  Whenever a byte of data is written to this
register, transmission will start as long as Timer A is running and in
continuous mode.  Data is sent at half the Timer A rage, and an output
will appear on the CNT line (pin 4 of the User Port) whenever a bit is
sent.  After all eight bits have been sent, an interrupt is generated
to indicate that it is time to load the next byte to send into the
Serial Register.

The Serial Data Register is not used by the 64, which does all of its
serial I/O through the regular data ports."
