"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $28E?","address           $28E           LSTSHF
Last Pattern of SHIFT/CTRL/Logo Keypress

This location is used in combination with the one above to debounce
the special SHIFT keys.  This will keep the SHIFT/logo combination
from changing character sets back and forth during a single pressing
of both keys.

655-656       $28F-$290      KEYLOG
Vector to Keyboard Table Setup Routine

This location points to the address of the Operating System routine
which actually determines which keyboard matrix lookup table will be
used.

The routine looks at the value of the SHIFT flag at 653 ($28D), and
based on what value it finds there, stores the address of the correct
table to use at location 245 ($F5).

The interrupt driven keyboard-scanning routine jumps through this RAM
vector to get to the table setup routine.  Therefore, it is possible
to alter the address contained in this vector, and direct the keyscan
routine to your own routine, which can check the keypress and SHIFT
combination, and act before a character is printed.

Since this routine comes after the keypress, but before it is printed,
this is a very good place to have your preprocessor routine check for
a particular keypress.  An excellent example of such a program is the
'VICword' program by Mark Niggemann, COMPUTE!'s Second Book of VIC.
This program adds a machine language routine that checks if the SHIFT
or Commodore logo key is pressed while not in quote mode.  If it finds
one of these keypresses, it substitutes an entire BASIC keyword for
the letter (A-Z) of the key that was pressed.  An adaptation of that
program for the 64 appears below.
