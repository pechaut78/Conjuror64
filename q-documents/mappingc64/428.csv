Voice 1 Attack/Decay Register

Bits 0-3:  Select decay cycle duration (0-15)
Bits 4-7:  Select attack cycle duration (0-15)

Bits 4-7 control the duration of the attack cycle.  This is the period
of time over which the volume will rise from 0 to its peak amplitude.
There are 16 durations which may be selected.  The way in which the
number placed here corresponds to the elapsed time of this cycle is as
follows:

0 = 2 milliseconds           8 = 100 milliseconds
1 = 8 milliseconds           9 = 250 milliseconds
2 = 16 milliseconds         10 = 500 milliseconds
3 = 24 milliseconds         11 = 800 milliseconds
4 = 38 milliseconds         12 = 1 second
5 = 56 milliseconds         13 = 3 seconds
6 = 68 milliseconds         14 = 5 seconds
7 = 80 milliseconds         15 = 8 seconds

Bits 0-3 control the length of the decay phase, in which the volume of
the note declines from the peak reached in the attack phase to the
sustain level.  The number selected corresponds to the length of this
phase as shown below:

0 = 6 milliseconds           8 = 300 milliseconds
1 = 24 milliseconds          9 = 750 milliseconds
2 = 48 milliseconds         10 = 1.5 seconds
3 = 72 milliseconds         11 = 2.4 seconds
4 = 114 milliseconds        12 = 3 seconds
5 = 168 milliseconds        13 = 9 seconds
6 = 204 milliseconds        14 = 15 seconds
7 = 240 milliseconds        15 = 24 seconds

Since the two functions share one register, you must multiply the
attack value by 16 and add it to the decay value in order to come up
with the number to be placed in the register:

REGISTER VALUE=(ATTACK*16)+DECAY"
