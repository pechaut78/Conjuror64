Designate a Logical File As the Current Input Channel

This is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at 65478 ($FFC6).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 798 ($31E).  If you wish to
get data from any device other than the keyboard, this routine must be
called after OPENing the device, before you can get a data byte with
the CHRIN or GETIN routine.  When called, the routine will designate
the logical file whose file number is in the .X register as the
current file, its device as the current device, and its secondary
address as the current secondary address.  If the device on the
channel is a serial device, which requires a TALK command and
sometimes a secondary address, this routine will send them over the
serial bus."
