"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $A002-$A003?","address  $A002-$A003
Warm Start Vector

The warm start vector points to the address of the routines used to
reset BASIC after the STOP/RESTORE key combination is pressed.  This
is the same address to which the BRK instruction is vectored.  When
BASIC is entered through this vector, the program in memory is not
disturbed.  For more information, see the entry for 58235 ($E37B), the
current warm start entry point."
