Convert a Single Numeric Term from ASCII Text to a Floating Point
Number

This routine reduces a single arithmetic term which is part of an
expression from ASCII text to its floating point equivalent.

If the term is a constant, the routine sets the data type flag to
number, sets the text pointer to the first ASCII numeric character,
and jumps to the routine which converts the ASCII string to a floating
point number.

If the term is a variable, the variable value is retrieved.  If it is
the PI character, the value of PI is moved into the Floating Point
Accumulator.

This routine is vectored through RAM at 778 ($30A)."
