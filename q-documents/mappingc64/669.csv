Read/Set Bottom of RAM Pointer

This is a documented Kernal routine, which can be entered through the
jump table at location 65436 ($FF9C).

It can be used to either read or set the bottom of RAM pointer.  If
called with the Carry flag set, the address in the pointer willbe
loaded into the .X and .Y registers.  If called with the Carry flag
cleared, the pointer will be changed to the address found in the .X
and .Y registers."
