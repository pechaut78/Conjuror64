Sprite to Foreground Display Priority Register

Bit 0:  Select display priority of Sprite 0 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 1:  Select display priority of Sprite 1 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 2:  Select display priority of Sprite 2 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 3:  Select display priority of Sprite 3 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 4:  Select display priority of Sprite 4 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 5:  Select display priority of Sprite 5 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 6:  Select display priority of Sprite 6 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)
Bit 7:  Select display priority of Sprite 7 to foreground (0=sprite
        appears in front of foreground)

If a sprite is positioned to appear at a spot on the screen that is
already occupied by text or bitmap graphics, a conflict arises.  The
contents of this register determines which one will be displayed in
such a situation.  If the bit that corresponds to a particular sprite
is set to 0, the sprite will be displayed in front of the foreground
graphics data.  If that bit is set to 1, the foreground data will be
displayed in front of the sprite.  The default value that this
register is set to at power-on is 0, so all sprites start out with
priority over foreground graphics.

Note that for the purpose of priority, the 01 bit-pair of multicolor
graphics modes is considered to display a background color, and
therefore will be shown behind sprite graphics even if the foreground
graphics data takes priority.  Also, between the sprites themselves
there is a fixed priority.  Each sprite has priority over all
higher-number sprites, so that Sprite 0 is displayed in front of all
the others.

The use of priority can aid in creating three-dimensional effects, by
allowing some objects on the screen to pass in front of or behind
other objects."
