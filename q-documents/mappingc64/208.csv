Autostart ROM Cartridge

An 8K or 16K autostart ROM cartridge designed to use this as a
starting memory address may be plugged into the Expansion Port on the
back.  If the cartridge ROM at locations 32772-32776 ($8004-$8008)
contains the numbers 195, 194, 205, 56, 48 ($C3, $C2, $CD, $38, $30)
when the computer powers up, it will start the program pointed to by
the vector at locations 32768-32769 ($8000-$8001), and will use
32770-32771 ($8002-$8003) for a warm start vector when the RESTORE key
is pressed.  These characters are PETASCII for the inverse letters
CBM, followed by the digits 80.  An autostart cartridge may also be
addressed at 40960 ($A000), where it would replace BASIC, or at 61440
($F000), where it would replace the Kernal.

It is possible to have a 16K cartridge sitting at 32768 ($8000), such
as Simon's BASIC, which can be turned on and off so that the BASIC ROM
underneath can also be used.  Finally, it is even possible to have
bank-selected cartridges, which turn banks of memory in the cartidge
on and off alternately, so that a 32K program could fit into only 16K
of addressing space."
