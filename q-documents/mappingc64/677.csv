Initialize Screen Editor and VIC-II Chip

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
located at 65409 ($FF81).

The start of the routine appears to be a patch that was added to later
versions of the Kernal.  It first calls the old routine at 58648
($E518).  This initializes the VIC-II chip to the default values, sets
the keyboard as the input device and the screen as the output device,
initializes the cursor flash variables, builds the screen line link
table, clears the screen, and homes the cursor.  The new code then
checks the VIC Interrupt register to see if the conditions for a
Raster Compare IRQ have been fulfilled.  Since the Raster Register was
initialized to 311, that can only occur when using a PAL system (NTSC
screens do not have that many scan lines).  The PAL/NTSC register at
678 ($2A6) is set on the basis of the outcome of this test.  The CIA
#1 Timer A is then set to cause an IRQ interrupt every sixtieth of a
second, using the prescaler figures for a PAL or NTSC system, as
appropriate."
