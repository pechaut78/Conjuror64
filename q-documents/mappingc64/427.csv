Voice 1 Control Register

Bit 0:  Gate Bit:  1=Start attack/decay/sustain, 0=Start release
Bit 1:  Sync Bit:  1=Synchronize Oscillator with Oscillator 3 frequency
Bit 2:  Ring Modulation:  1=Ring modulate Oscillators 1 and 3
Bit 3:  Test Bit:  1=Disable Oscillator 1
Bit 4:  Select triangle waveform
Bit 5:  Select sawtooth waveform
Bit 6:  Select pulse waveform
Bit 7:  Select random noise waveform


Bit 0.  Bit 0 is used to gate the sound.  Setting this bit to a 1
while selecting one of the four waveforms will start the
attack/decay/sustain part of the cycle.  Setting this bit back to 0
(while keeping the same waveform setting) anytime after a note has
started playing will begin the release cycle of the note.  Of course,
in order for the gate bit to have an effect, the frequency and
attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) registers must be set, as well as
the pulse width, if necessary, and the volume control set to a nonzero
value.

Bit 1.  This bit is used to synchronize the fundamental frequency of
Oscillator 1 with the fundamental frequency of Oscillator 3, allowing
you to create a wide range of complex harmonic structures from voice
1.  Synchronization occurs when this bit is set to 1.  Oscillator 3
must be set to some frequency other than zero, but no other voice 3
parameters will affect the output from voice 1.

Bit 2.  When Bit 2 is set to 1, the triangle waveform output of voice
1 is replaced with a ring modulated combination of Oscillators 1 and
3.  This ring modulation produces nonharmonic overtone structures that
are useful for creating bell or gong effects.

Bit 3.  Bit 3 is the test bit.  When set to 1, it disables the output
of the oscillator.  This can be useful in generating very complex
waveforms (even speech synthesis) under software control.

Bit 4.  When set to 1, Bit 4 selects the triangle waveform output of
Oscillator 1.  Bit 0 must also be set for the note to be sounded.

Bit 5.  This bit selects the sawtooth waveform when set to 1.  Bit 0
must also be set for the sound to begin.

Bit 6.  Bit 6 chooses the pulse waveform when set to 1.  The harmonic
content of sound produced using this waveform may be varied using the
Pulse Width Registers.  Bit 0 must be set to begin the sound.

Bit 7.  When Bit 7 is set to 1, the noise output waveform for
Oscillator 1 is set.  This creates a random sound output whose
waveform varies with a frequency proportionate to that of Oscillator
1.  It can be used to imitate the sound of explosions, drums, and
other unpitched noises.

One of the four waveforms must be chosed in order to create a sound.
Setting more than one of these bits will result in a logical ANDing of
the waveforms.  Particularly, the combination of the noise waveform
and another is not recommended.

Voice 1 Envelop (ADSR) Control

When a note is played on a musical instrument, the volume does not
suddenly rise to a peak and then cut off to zero.  Rather, the volume
builds to a peak, levels off to an intermediate value, and then fades
away.  This creates what is known as a volume envelope.

The first phase of the envelope, in which the volume builds to a peak,
is known as the attack phase.  The second, in which it declines to an
intermediate level, is called the decay phase.  The third, in which
the intermediate leve of volume is held, is known as the sustain
period.  The final interval, in which the sound fades away, is called
the release part of the cycle.

The SID chip allows the volume envelope of each voice to be
controlled, so that specific instruments may be imitated, or new
sounds created.  This is done via the attack/decay and sustain/release
registers.  Each register devotes four bits (which can store a number
from 0 to 15) to each phase of the cycle.  When a note is gated by
writing a 1 to a waveform bit and to Bit 0 of the Control Register,
the attack cycle begins.

The volume of the sound builds to a peak over the period of time
specified by the high nybble of the attack/decay register.  Once it
has reached the peak volume, it falls to the intermediate level during
the period indicated by the low nybble of the attack/decay register
(this is the decay phase).  The volume of this intermediate or sustain
level is selected by placing a value in the high nybble of the
sustain/release register.  This volume level is held until a 0 is
written to the gate bit of the control register (while leaving the
waveform bit set).  When that happens, the release phase begins, and
the volume of the sound begins to taper off during the period
indicated by the low nybble of the sustain/release register.

You may notice the volume of the sound does not quite get to 0 at the
end of the release cycle, and you may need to turn off the sound to
get rid of the residual noise.  You can do this either by setting the
waveform bit back to 0, changing the frequency to 0, or setting the
volume to 0."
