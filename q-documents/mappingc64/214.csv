Statement Dispatch Vector Table

This table contains two-byte vectors, each of which points to an
address which is one byte before the address of one of the routines
that perform a BASIC statement.

The statements are in token number order.  When it comes time to
execute a statement, the NEWSTT routine at 42926 ($A7AE) places this
address-1 on the stack and jumps to the CHRGET routine.  The RTS
instruction at the end of that routine causes the statement address to
be pulled off the stack, incremented, and placed in the Program
Counter, just as if it were the actual return address."
