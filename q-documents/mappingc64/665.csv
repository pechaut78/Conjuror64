Read the I/O Status Word

This is a documented Kernal routine, which can be entered through the
jump table at location 65463 ($FFB7).

Whenever an I/O error occurs, a bit of the Status Word is set to
indicate what the problem was.  The routine allows you to read the
status word (it is returned in the Accumulator).  If the device was
the RS-232, its status register is read and cleared to zero.  For the
meanings of the various status codes, see the entry for location 144
($90) or 663 ($297) for the RS-232 device."
