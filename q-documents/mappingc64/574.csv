Control Keyboard Matrix Decode Table

This table contains the 64 PETASCII values for the Control keyboard,
one for each key which is struck while the CTRL key is pressed.  The
table is in keycode order (see the keycode table in Appendix H for the
correspondence of keycode to key).  A 65th byte with the value of 255
($FF) marks the end of the table (this corresponds to a keypress value
of 64, no key pressed).

The only keys generally struck in combination with the CTRL key are
the ones that change the colors on the top row of the keyboard, but
this doesn't necessarily mean that the other CTRL key combinations
don't do anything.  On the contrary, looking at the values in this
table, you can see that any of the first 32 values in the PETASCII
table can be produced by some combination of the CTRL key and another
key.  CTRL-@ produces a CHR$(0).  CTRL-A through CTRL-Z produce
CHR$(1) through CHR$(26).  Ctrl-: is the same as CHR$(27), CTRL-Lira
(that's the slashed-L British pound sign) produces CHR$(28), CTRL-;
equals CHR$(29), CTRL-up arrow produces CHR$(30), and CTRL-= produces
CHR$(31).

Any of these combinations produce the same effect as the CHR$(X)
statement.  For examble, CTRL-; moves the cursor over to the right,
CTRL-N switches to lowercase, CTRL-R turns on reverse video, and
CTRL-E changes the printing to white."
