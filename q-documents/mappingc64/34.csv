"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $3F-$40?","address         $3F-$40        DATLIN
Current DATA Line Number

This location holds the line number of the current DATA statement
being READ.  It should be noted that this information is not used to
determine where the next DATA item is read from (that is the job of
the pointer at 65-66 ($41-$42) below).  But if an error concerning the
DATA occurs, this number will be moved to 57 ($39), so that the error
message will show that the error occurred in the line that contains
the DATA statement, rather than in the line that contains the READ
statement."
