Perform FN

The FN evaluation is done by evaluating the FN argument (for example,
FN(A+B*C/D)) and then getting the rest of the expression from the text
of the function definition statement.  The function variable
descriptor area is used as a work area, and the dependent variable is
not disturbed (so that if the definition used FN(X), the value of X
will not be changed by the function call)."
