Counter for Timing the Delay Between Key Repeats

This location is used as a delay counter to determine how long to wait
while a key is being held down until the next repeat printing of that
key.

The value here starts at 6.  If location 652 ($28C) contains a 0, the
value in this location is counted down once every 1/60 second, so long
as the same key is held down.  When this counter gets to 0, and if the
repeat flag at 650 ($28A) allows that key to repeat, its ASCII
equivalent will once again be placed in the keyboard buffer.  A value
of 4 is then placed in location 651, allowing subsequent repeats to
occur at a rate of 15 per second."
