Decode the Keystroke and Place its ASCII Value in the Keyboard Buffer

This is the continuation of the IRQ keyscan routine.  It decodes the
keycode with the proper PETASCII table, and compares it with the last
keystroke.  If if is the same, it checks to see if it is okay to
repeat the character without waiting for the key to be let up.  If the
character should be printed, it is moved to the end of the keyboard
buffer at 631 ($277)."
