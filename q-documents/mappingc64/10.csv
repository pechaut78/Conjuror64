Index into the Text Input Buffer/Number of Array Subscripts

The routines that convert the text in the input buffer at 512 ($200)
into lines of executable program tokes, and the routines that link
these program lines together, use this location as an index into the
input buffer area.  When the job of converting text to tokens is
finished, the value in this location is equal to the length of the
tokenized line.

The routines which build an array or locate an element in an array use
this location to calculate the number of DIMensions called for and the
amount of storage required for a newly created array, or the number of
subscripts specified when referencing an array element."
