Set Lowercase/Uppercase or Uppercase/Graphics Character Set

The part of the Kernal CHROUT routine that outputs to the screen uses
this subroutine to check for the special nonprinting characters that
switch the character set (CHR$(14) and CHR$(142)).  If one of these is
the character to be printed, this routine makes the switch by setting
the location 53272 ($D018) accordingly."
