Convert a Floating Point Number to a Signed Integer

This subroutine first checks to make sure that the number in the
Floating Point Accumulator is between 32767 and -32768.  If it is not,
an ILLEGAL QUANTITY error results.  If it is, the routine converts it
to a 16-bit signed integer with the high byte in location 100 ($64),
and the low byte in location 101 ($65)."
