RS-232: Mock 6551 Status Register

The contents of this register indicate the error status of RS-232 data
transmission.  That status can be determined by PEEKing this location
directly, by referencing the BASIC reserved variable ST, or by using
the Kernal READST (65031, $FE07) routine.

Note that if you use ST or Kernal, this location will be set to 0
after it is read.  Therefore, if you need to test more than one bit,
make sure that each test preserves the original value, because you
won't be able to read it again.  The meaning of each bit value is
specified below:

Bit 7: 1 (bit value of 128) = Break Detected
Bit 6: 1 (bit value of 64)  = DTR (Data Set Ready) Signal Missing
Bit 5: Unused
Bit 4: 1 (bit value of 16)  = CTS (Clear to Send) Signal Missing
Bit 3: 1 (bit value of 8)   = Receiver Buffer Empty
Bit 2: 1 (bit value of 4)   = Receiver Buffer Overrun
Bit 1: 1 (bit value of 2)   = Framing Error
Bit 0: 1 (bit value of 1)   = Parity Error

The user is responsible for checking these errors and taking
appropriate action.  If, for example, you find that Bit 0 or 1 is set
when you are sending, indicating a framing or parity error, you should
resend the last byte.  If Bit 2 is set, the GET#2 command is not being
executed quickly enough to empty the buffer (BASIC should be able to
keep up at 300 baud, but not higher).  If Bit 7 is set, you will want
to stop sending, and execute a GET#2 to see what is being sent."
