"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $ED0C?","address              $ED0C          LISTEN

This is a documented Kernal routine whose entry in the jump table is
65457 ($FFB1).  When called, it ORs the device number in the
Accumulator with the LISTEN code (32, $20) and sends it on the serial
bus.  This commands the device to LISTEN."
