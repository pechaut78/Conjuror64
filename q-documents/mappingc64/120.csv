"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $D8?","address          $D8            INSRT
Flag: Insert Mode (Any Number Greater Than 0 Is the Number of Inserts)

When the INST key is pressed, the screen editor shifts the line to the
right, allocates another physical line to the logical line if
necessary (and possible), updates the screen line length in 213 ($D5),
and adjusts the screen line link table at 217 ($D9).  This location is
used to keep track of the number of spaces that has been opened up in
this way.

Until the spaces that have been opened up are filled, the editor acts
as if in quote mode (see location 212 ($D4), the quote mode flag).
This means that cursor control characters that are normally
nonprinting will leave a printed equivalent on the screen when
entered, instead of having their normal effect on cursor movement,
etc.  The only difference between insert and quote mode is that the
DELETE key will leave a printed equivalent in insert mode, while the
INST key will insert spaces as normal."
