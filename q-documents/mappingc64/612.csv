Designate a Logical File As the Current Output Channel

This is a documented Kernal routine which can be entered from the jump
table at 65481 ($FFC9).

The routine jumps through a RAM vector at 800 ($320).  If you wish to
output data to any device other than the screen, this routine must be
called after OPENing the device, and before you output a data byte
with the CHROUT routine.  When called, the routine will designate the
logical file whose file number is in the .X register as the current
file, its device as the current device, and its secondary address as
the current secondary address.  If the device on the channel uses the
serial bus, and therefore requires a LISTEN command and possibly a
secondary address, this information will be sent on the bus."
