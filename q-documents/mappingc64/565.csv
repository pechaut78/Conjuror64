Read the Keyboard

This subroutine is called by the IRQ interrupt handler above to read
the keyboard device which is connected to CIA #1 (see entry for 56320
($DC00) for details on how to read the keyboard).

It is the Kernal routine SCNKEY which can be entered from the jump
table at 65439 ($FF9F).  This routine returns the keycode of the key
currently being pressed in 203 ($CB), sets the shift/control flag if
appropriate, and jumps through the vector at 655 ($28F) to the routine
that sets up the proper table to translate the keycode to PETASCII.
It concludes with the next routine, which places the PETASCII value of
the character in the keyboard buffer."
