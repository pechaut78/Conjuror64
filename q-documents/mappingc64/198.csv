"What is the purpose of the memory location at address $32E-$32F?","address       $32E-$32F      USRCMD
Vector to User-Defined Command (Currently Points to BRK at 65126
($FE66))

This appears to be a holdover from PET days, when the built-in machine
language monitor would JuMP through the USRCMD vector when it
encountered a command that it did not understand, allowing the user to
add new commands to the monitor.

Although this vector is initialized to point to the routine called by
STOP/ RESTORE and the BRK interrupt, and is updated by the Kernal
VECTOR routine (64794, $FD1A), it does not seem to have the function
of aiding in the addition of new commands."
